## Greetings
# 1 
\bibverse{1} From the elder, to the lady chosen by God and her children. I truly love you all, and I am not the only one but all who know the truth love you as well. \bibverse{2} We love you for the sake of the truth, which lives in us and will be with us forever. 

\bibverse{3} Grace, mercy, and peace will be ours — the gift of God, the Father, and of Jesus Christ, the Father's Son — in truth and love. ## Live
in truth and love 

\bibverse{4} It was a great joy to me to find the lives of some of your children guided by the truth, in obedience to the command that we received from the Father. \bibverse{5} And now I implore you, dear lady, let us love one another This is not a new command I am writing to you. It is the command we have had from the beginning. — Let us love one another. \bibverse{6} And this is love — to live in obedience to the Father's commands. This is the command as you learnt from the beginning, to live a life of love. \bibverse{7} I say this because many deceivers have gone out into the world — men who do not acknowledge that Jesus Christ came in flesh and blood. Any such person is a deceiver and antichrist. \bibverse{8} Take care so that you do not what we have worked for but instead receive your full reward. \bibverse{9} Anyone who goes beyond and fails to live inside of the teaching of Christ does not have God. The person who lives inside that teaching — they have both the Father and the Son. \bibverse{10} If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive them into your house or even welcome them; \bibverse{11} because the person who welcomes them is sharing with them in his evil work. ## Final words


\bibverse{12} Though I have many other things to tell you, I would rather not use paper and ink. Instead I hope to come and see you, and to speak with you face to face, so that our joy may be complete. \bibverse{13} The children of your sister, who is chosen by God, send you their greetings.
