^11^

### The honest way of life of the apostle and his truthfulness in correspondence
^14^

### The apostle's account of the change in his travel plans; Indication of his trustworthiness as an apostle of Christ and faithful God
^15^

### Indication of the topic: The justification
^17^

### They are servants and collaborators of God
^5^

### The glory of the new covenant and the apostolic ministry over the old covenant and the ministry of Moses
