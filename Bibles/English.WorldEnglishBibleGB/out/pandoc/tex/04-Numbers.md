They shall carry the tabernacle and all its furnishings; and they shall take care of it, and shall encamp around it. \bibleverse{51} When the tabernacle is to move, the Levites shall take it down; and when the tabernacle is to be set up, the Levites shall set it up. The stranger who comes near shall be put to death. \bibleverse{52} The children of Israel shall pitch their tents, every man by his own camp, and every man by his own standard, according to their divisions. \bibleverse{53} But the Levites shall encamp around the Tabernacle of the Testimony, that there may be no wrath on the congregation of the children of Israel.

They shall serve in there. \bibleverse{27} At the commandment of Aaron and his sons shall be all the service of the sons of the Gershonites, in all their burden and in all their service; and you shall appoint their duty to them in all their responsibilities. \bibleverse{28} This is the service of the families of the sons of the Gershonites in the Tent of Meeting. Their duty shall be under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest. \bibleverse{29} “As for the sons of Merari, you shall count them by their families, by their fathers’ houses; \bibleverse{30} you shall count them from thirty years old and upward even to fifty years old—everyone who enters on the service, to do the work of the Tent of Meeting. \bibleverse{31} This is the duty of their burden, according to all their service in the Tent of Meeting: the tabernacle’s boards, its bars, its pillars, its sockets, \bibleverse{32} the pillars of the court around it, their sockets, their pins, their cords, with all their instruments, and with all their service.

He shall pour no oil on it, nor put frankincense on it, for it is a meal offering of jealousy, a meal offering of memorial, bringing iniquity to memory. \bibleverse{16} The priest shall bring her near, and set her before the [Lord]{.smallcaps}. \bibleverse{17} The priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel; and the priest shall take some of the dust that is on the floor of the tabernacle and put it into the water. \bibleverse{18} The priest shall set the woman before the [Lord]{.smallcaps}, and let the hair of the woman’s head go loose, and put the meal offering of memorial in her hands, which is the meal offering of jealousy. The priest shall have in his hand the water of bitterness that brings a curse. \bibleverse{19} The priest shall cause her to take an oath and shall tell the woman, “If no man has lain with you, and if you haven’t gone aside to uncleanness, being under your husband’s authority, be free from this water of bitterness that brings a curse. \bibleverse{20} But if you have gone astray, being under your husband’s authority, and if you are defiled, and some man has lain with you besides your husband—” \bibleverse{21} then the priest shall cause the woman to swear with the oath of cursing, and the priest shall tell the woman, “May The [Lord]{.smallcaps} make you a curse and an oath amongst your people, when the [Lord]{.smallcaps} allows your thigh to fall away, and your body to swell; \bibleverse{22} and this water that brings a curse will go into your bowels, and make your body swell, and your thigh fall away.” The woman shall say, “Amen, Amen.” \bibleverse{23} “‘The priest shall write these curses in a book, and he shall wipe them into the water of bitterness. \bibleverse{24} He shall make the woman drink the water of bitterness that causes the curse; and the water that causes the curse shall enter into her and become bitter. \bibleverse{25} The priest shall take the meal offering of jealousy out of the woman’s hand, and shall wave the meal offering before the [Lord]{.smallcaps}, and bring it to the altar. \bibleverse{26} The priest shall take a handful of the meal offering, as its memorial portion, and burn it on the altar, and afterward shall make the woman drink the water. \bibleverse{27} When he has made her drink the water, then it shall happen, if she is defiled and has committed a trespass against her husband, that the water that causes the curse will enter into her and become bitter, and her body will swell, and her thigh will fall away; and the woman will be a curse amongst her people. \bibleverse{28} If the woman isn’t defiled, but is clean; then she shall be free, and shall conceive offspring.^[**5:28** or, seed] \bibleverse{29} “‘This is the law of jealousy, when a wife, being under her husband, goes astray, and is defiled, \bibleverse{30} or when the spirit of jealousy comes on a man, and he is jealous of his wife; then he shall set the woman before the [Lord]{.smallcaps}, and the priest shall execute on her all this law. \bibleverse{31} The man shall be free from iniquity, and that woman shall bear her iniquity.’” 

## Rules regarding Nazirites
# 6 
\bibleverse{1} The [Lord]{.smallcaps} spoke to Moses, saying, \bibleverse{2} “Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them: ‘When either man or woman shall make a special vow, the vow of a Nazirite, to separate himself to the [Lord]{.smallcaps}, \bibleverse{3} he shall separate himself from wine and strong drink. He shall drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of fermented drink, neither shall he drink any juice of grapes, nor eat fresh grapes or dried. \bibleverse{4} All the days of his separation he shall eat nothing that is made of the grapevine, from the seeds even to the skins. \bibleverse{5} “‘All the days of his vow of separation no razor shall come on his head, until the days are fulfilled in which he separates himself to the [Lord]{.smallcaps}. He shall be holy. He shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow long. \bibleverse{6} “‘All the days that he separates himself to the [Lord]{.smallcaps} he shall not go near a dead body. \bibleverse{7} He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for his mother, for his brother, or for his sister, when they die, because his separation to God^[**6:7** The Hebrew word rendered “God” is “\hebrew{אֱלֹהִ֑ים}” (Elohim).] is on his head. \bibleverse{8} All the days of his separation he is holy to the [Lord]{.smallcaps}.

## Regulations regarding Nazirite contamination
\bibleverse{9} “‘If any man dies very suddenly beside him, and he defiles the head of his separation, then he shall shave his head in the day of his cleansing. On the seventh day he shall shave it. \bibleverse{10} On the eighth day he shall bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons to the priest, to the door of the Tent of Meeting. \bibleverse{11} The priest shall offer one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering, and make atonement for him, because he sinned by reason of the dead, and shall make his head holy that same day. \bibleverse{12} He shall separate to the [Lord]{.smallcaps} the days of his separation, and shall bring a male lamb a year old for a trespass offering; but the former days shall be void, because his separation was defiled.

## Ordinances on the sacrificial ceremony at the end of the Nazirite
\bibleverse{13} “‘This is the law of the Nazirite: when the days of his separation are fulfilled, he shall be brought to the door of the Tent of Meeting, \bibleverse{14} and he shall offer his offering to the [Lord]{.smallcaps}: one male lamb a year old without defect for a burnt offering, one ewe lamb a year old without defect for a sin offering, one ram without defect for peace offerings, \bibleverse{15} a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mixed with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil with their meal offering and their drink offerings. \bibleverse{16} The priest shall present them before the [Lord]{.smallcaps}, and shall offer his sin offering and his burnt offering. \bibleverse{17} He shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings to the [Lord]{.smallcaps}, with the basket of unleavened bread. The priest shall offer also its meal offering and its drink offering. \bibleverse{18} The Nazirite shall shave the head of his separation at the door of the Tent of Meeting, take the hair of the head of his separation, and put it on the fire which is under the sacrifice of peace offerings. \bibleverse{19} The priest shall take the boiled shoulder of the ram, one unleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and shall put them on the hands of the Nazirite after he has shaved the head of his separation; \bibleverse{20} and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the [Lord]{.smallcaps}. They are holy for the priest, together with the breast that is waved and the thigh that is offered. After that the Nazirite may drink wine. \bibleverse{21} “‘This is the law of the Nazirite who vows and of his offering to the [Lord]{.smallcaps} for his separation, in addition to that which he is able to afford. According to his vow which he vows, so he must do after the law of his separation.’”

## Order of Priestly Blessing
\bibleverse{22} The [Lord]{.smallcaps} spoke to Moses, saying, \bibleverse{23} “Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, ‘This is how you shall bless the children of Israel.’ You shall tell them, \bibleverse{24} ‘The [Lord]{.smallcaps} bless you, and keep you. \bibleverse{25} The [Lord]{.smallcaps} make his face to shine on you, and be gracious to you. \bibleverse{26} The [Lord]{.smallcaps} lift up his face towards you, and give you peace.’ \bibleverse{27} “So they shall put my name on the children of Israel; and I will bless them.” 

## The tribal chiefs' consecration gifts for the shrine
# 7 
\bibleverse{1} On the day that Moses had finished setting up the tabernacle, and had anointed it and sanctified it with all its furniture, and the altar with all its vessels, and had anointed and sanctified them; \bibleverse{2} the princes of Israel, the heads of their fathers’ houses, gave offerings. These were the princes of the tribes. These are they who were over those who were counted; \bibleverse{3} and they brought their offering before the [Lord]{.smallcaps}, six covered wagons and twelve oxen; a wagon for every two of the princes, and for each one an ox. They presented them before the tabernacle. \bibleverse{4} The [Lord]{.smallcaps} spoke to Moses, saying, \bibleverse{5} “Accept these from them, that they may be used in doing the service of the Tent of Meeting; and you shall give them to the Levites, to every man according to his service.” \bibleverse{6} Moses took the wagons and the oxen, and gave them to the Levites. \bibleverse{7} He gave two wagons and four oxen to the sons of Gershon, according to their service. \bibleverse{8} He gave four wagons and eight oxen to the sons of Merari, according to their service, under the direction of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest. \bibleverse{9} But to the sons of Kohath he gave none, because the service of the sanctuary belonged to them; they carried it on their shoulders. \bibleverse{10} The princes gave offerings for the dedication of the altar in the day that it was anointed. The princes gave their offerings before the altar. \bibleverse{11} The [Lord]{.smallcaps} said to Moses, “They shall offer their offering, each prince on his day, for the dedication of the altar.” \bibleverse{12} He who offered his offering the first day was Nahshon the son of Amminadab, of the tribe of Judah, \bibleverse{13} and his offering was: one silver platter, the weight of which was one hundred and thirty shekels,^[**7:13** A shekel is about 10 grams or about 0.35 ounces.] one silver bowl of seventy shekels, according to the shekel of the sanctuary, both of them full of fine flour mixed with oil for a meal offering; \bibleverse{14} one golden ladle of ten shekels, full of incense; \bibleverse{15} one young bull, one ram, one male lamb a year old, for a burnt offering; \bibleverse{16} one male goat for a sin offering; \bibleverse{17} and for the sacrifice of peace offerings, two head of cattle, five rams, five male goats, and five male lambs a year old.

# 8 
\bibleverse{1} The [Lord]{.smallcaps} spoke to Moses, saying, \bibleverse{2} “Speak to Aaron, and tell him, ‘When you light the lamps, the seven lamps shall give light in front of the lamp stand.’” \bibleverse{3} Aaron did so.

## The consecration of the Levites as a holy gift to God
\bibleverse{5} The [Lord]{.smallcaps} spoke to Moses, saying, \bibleverse{6} “Take the Levites from amongst the children of Israel, and cleanse them. \bibleverse{7} You shall do this to them to cleanse them: sprinkle the water of cleansing on them, let them shave their whole bodies with a razor, let them wash their clothes, and cleanse themselves. \bibleverse{8} Then let them take a young bull and its meal offering, fine flour mixed with oil; and another young bull you shall take for a sin offering. \bibleverse{9} You shall present the Levites before the Tent of Meeting. You shall assemble the whole congregation of the children of Israel. \bibleverse{10} You shall present the Levites before the [Lord]{.smallcaps}. The children of Israel shall lay their hands on the Levites, \bibleverse{11} and Aaron shall offer the Levites before the [Lord]{.smallcaps} for a wave offering on the behalf of the children of Israel, that it may be theirs to do the service of the [Lord]{.smallcaps}. \bibleverse{12} “The Levites shall lay their hands on the heads of the bulls, and you shall offer the one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering to the [Lord]{.smallcaps}, to make atonement for the Levites. \bibleverse{13} You shall set the Levites before Aaron and before his sons, and offer them as a wave offering to the [Lord]{.smallcaps}. \bibleverse{14} Thus you shall separate the Levites from amongst the children of Israel, and the Levites shall be mine. \bibleverse{15} “After that, the Levites shall go in to do the service of the Tent of Meeting. You shall cleanse them, and offer them as a wave offering. \bibleverse{16} For they are wholly given to me from amongst the children of Israel; instead of all who open the womb, even the firstborn of all the children of Israel, I have taken them to me. \bibleverse{17} For all the firstborn amongst the children of Israel are mine, both man and animal. On the day that I struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, I sanctified them for myself. \bibleverse{18} I have taken the Levites instead of all the firstborn amongst the children of Israel. \bibleverse{19} I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his sons from amongst the children of Israel, to do the service of the children of Israel in the Tent of Meeting, and to make atonement for the children of Israel, so that there will be no plague amongst the children of Israel when the children of Israel come near to the sanctuary.” \bibleverse{20} Moses, and Aaron, and all the congregation of the children of Israel did so to the Levites. According to all that the [Lord]{.smallcaps} commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so the children of Israel did to them. \bibleverse{21} The Levites purified themselves from sin, and they washed their clothes; and Aaron offered them for a wave offering before the [Lord]{.smallcaps} and Aaron made atonement for them to cleanse them. \bibleverse{22} After that, the Levites went in to do their service in the Tent of Meeting before Aaron and before his sons: as the [Lord]{.smallcaps} had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so they did to them.

## The time of duty of the Levites
\bibleverse{23} The [Lord]{.smallcaps} spoke to Moses, saying, \bibleverse{24} “This is what is assigned to the Levites: from twenty-five years old and upward they shall go in to wait on the service in the work of the Tent of Meeting; \bibleverse{25} and from the age of fifty years they shall retire from doing the work, and shall serve no more, \bibleverse{26} but shall assist their brothers in the Tent of Meeting, to perform the duty, and shall perform no service. This is how you shall have the Levites do their duties.” 

## The post-Passover celebration for the unclean and travellers; strangers easter
# 9 
\bibleverse{1} The [Lord]{.smallcaps} spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying, \bibleverse{2} “Let the children of Israel keep the Passover in its appointed season. \bibleverse{3} On the fourteenth day of this month, at evening, you shall keep it in its appointed season. You shall keep it according to all its statutes and according to all its ordinances.” \bibleverse{4} Moses told the children of Israel that they should keep the Passover. \bibleverse{5} They kept the Passover in the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at evening, in the wilderness of Sinai. According to all that the [Lord]{.smallcaps} commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did. \bibleverse{6} There were certain men who were unclean because of the dead body of a man, so that they could not keep the Passover on that day, and they came before Moses and Aaron on that day. \bibleverse{7} Those men said to him, “We are unclean because of the dead body of a man. Why are we kept back, that we may not offer the offering of the [Lord]{.smallcaps} in its appointed season amongst the children of Israel?” \bibleverse{8} Moses answered them, “Wait, that I may hear what the [Lord]{.smallcaps} will command concerning you.” \bibleverse{9} The [Lord]{.smallcaps} spoke to Moses, saying, \bibleverse{10} “Say to the children of Israel, ‘If any man of you or of your generations is unclean by reason of a dead body, or is on a journey far away, he shall still keep the Passover to the [Lord]{.smallcaps}. \bibleverse{11} In the second month, on the fourteenth day at evening they shall keep it; they shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs. \bibleverse{12} They shall leave none of it until the morning, nor break a bone of it. According to all the statute of the Passover they shall keep it. \bibleverse{13} But the man who is clean, and is not on a journey, and fails to keep the Passover, that soul shall be cut off from his people. Because he didn’t offer the offering of the [Lord]{.smallcaps} in its appointed season, that man shall bear his sin. \bibleverse{14} “‘If a foreigner lives amongst you and desires to keep the Passover to the [Lord]{.smallcaps}, then he shall do so according to the statute of the Passover, and according to its ordinance. You shall have one statute, both for the foreigner and for him who is born in the land.’”

## The appearance of the pillar of clouds and fire over the sanctuary
\bibleverse{15} On the day that the tabernacle was raised up, the cloud covered the tabernacle, even the Tent of the Testimony. At evening it was over the tabernacle, as it were the appearance of fire, until morning. \bibleverse{16} So it was continually. The cloud covered it, and the appearance of fire by night. \bibleverse{17} Whenever the cloud was taken up from over the Tent, then after that the children of Israel travelled; and in the place where the cloud remained, there the children of Israel encamped. \bibleverse{18} At the commandment of the [Lord]{.smallcaps}, the children of Israel travelled, and at the commandment of the [Lord]{.smallcaps} they encamped. As long as the cloud remained on the tabernacle they remained encamped. \bibleverse{19} When the cloud stayed on the tabernacle many days, then the children of Israel kept the [Lord]{.smallcaps}’s command, and didn’t travel. \bibleverse{20} Sometimes the cloud was a few days on the tabernacle; then according to the commandment of the [Lord]{.smallcaps} they remained encamped, and according to the commandment of the [Lord]{.smallcaps} they travelled. \bibleverse{21} Sometimes the cloud was from evening until morning; and when the cloud was taken up in the morning, they travelled; or by day and by night, when the cloud was taken up, they travelled. \bibleverse{22} Whether it was two days, or a month, or a year that the cloud stayed on the tabernacle, remaining on it, the children of Israel remained encamped, and didn’t travel; but when it was taken up, they travelled. \bibleverse{23} At the commandment of the [Lord]{.smallcaps} they encamped, and at the commandment of the [Lord]{.smallcaps} they travelled. They kept the [Lord]{.smallcaps}’s command, at the commandment of the [Lord]{.smallcaps} by Moses. 

## Ordinance on two silver trumpets
# 10 
\bibleverse{1} The [Lord]{.smallcaps} spoke to Moses, saying, \bibleverse{2} “Make two trumpets of silver. You shall make them of beaten work. You shall use them for the calling of the congregation and for the journeying of the camps. \bibleverse{3} When they blow them, all the congregation shall gather themselves to you at the door of the Tent of Meeting. \bibleverse{4} If they blow just one, then the princes, the heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves to you. \bibleverse{5} When you blow an alarm, the camps that lie on the east side shall go forward. \bibleverse{6} When you blow an alarm the second time, the camps that lie on the south side shall go forward. They shall blow an alarm for their journeys. \bibleverse{7} But when the assembly is to be gathered together, you shall blow, but you shall not sound an alarm. \bibleverse{8} “The sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow the trumpets. This shall be to you for a statute forever throughout your generations. \bibleverse{9} When you go to war in your land against the adversary who oppresses you, then you shall sound an alarm with the trumpets. Then you will be remembered before the [Lord]{.smallcaps} your God, and you will be saved from your enemies. \bibleverse{10} “Also in the day of your gladness, and in your set feasts, and in the beginnings of your months, you shall blow the trumpets over your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings; and they shall be to you for a memorial before your God. I am the [Lord]{.smallcaps} your God.”

## Departure from Sinai to the Paran desert
\bibleverse{11} In the second year, in the second month, on the twentieth day of the month, the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle of the covenant. \bibleverse{12} The children of Israel went forward on their journeys out of the wilderness of Sinai; and the cloud stayed in the wilderness of Paran.

## Train Order Description
\bibleverse{13} They first went forward according to the commandment of the [Lord]{.smallcaps} by Moses. \bibleverse{14} First, the standard of the camp of the children of Judah went forward according to their armies. Nahshon the son of Amminadab was over his army. \bibleverse{15} Nethanel the son of Zuar was over the army of the tribe of the children of Issachar. \bibleverse{16} Eliab the son of Helon was over the army of the tribe of the children of Zebulun. \bibleverse{17} The tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari, who bore the tabernacle, went forward. \bibleverse{18} The standard of the camp of Reuben went forward according to their armies. Elizur the son of Shedeur was over his army. \bibleverse{19} Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai was over the army of the tribe of the children of Simeon. \bibleverse{20} Eliasaph the son of Deuel was over the army of the tribe of the children of Gad. \bibleverse{21} The Kohathites set forward, bearing the sanctuary. The others set up the tabernacle before they arrived. \bibleverse{22} The standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set forward according to their armies. Elishama the son of Ammihud was over his army. \bibleverse{23} Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur was over the army of the tribe of the children of Manasseh. \bibleverse{24} Abidan the son of Gideoni was over the army of the tribe of the children of Benjamin. \bibleverse{25} The standard of the camp of the children of Dan, which was the rear guard of all the camps, set forward according to their armies. Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai was over his army. \bibleverse{26} Pagiel the son of Ochran was over the army of the tribe of the children of Asher. \bibleverse{27} Ahira the son of Enan was over the army of the tribe of the children of Naphtali. \bibleverse{28} Thus were the travels of the children of Israel according to their armies; and they went forward.

## Moses tries to win over his brother-in-law Hobab as a guide for the journey forward
\bibleverse{29} Moses said to Hobab, the son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses’ father-in-law, “We are journeying to the place of which the [Lord]{.smallcaps} said, ‘I will give it to you.’ Come with us, and we will treat you well; for the [Lord]{.smallcaps} has spoken good concerning Israel.” \bibleverse{30} He said to him, “I will not go; but I will depart to my own land, and to my relatives.” \bibleverse{31} Moses said, “Don’t leave us, please; because you know how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and you can be our eyes. \bibleverse{32} It shall be, if you go with us—yes, it shall be—that whatever good the [Lord]{.smallcaps} does to us, we will do the same to you.”

## The departure from the mountain of God under the guidance of the ark
\bibleverse{33} They set forward from the Mount of the [Lord]{.smallcaps} three days’ journey. The ark of the [Lord]{.smallcaps}’s covenant went before them three days’ journey, to seek out a resting place for them. \bibleverse{34} The cloud of the [Lord]{.smallcaps} was over them by day, when they set forward from the camp. \bibleverse{35} When the ark went forward, Moses said, “Rise up, [Lord]{.smallcaps}, and let your enemies be scattered! Let those who hate you flee before you!” \bibleverse{36} When it rested, he said, “Return, [Lord]{.smallcaps}, to the ten thousands of the thousands of Israel.” 

## The murmur of people and the campfire in Thabera
# 11 
\bibleverse{1} The people were complaining in the ears of the [Lord]{.smallcaps}. When the [Lord]{.smallcaps} heard it, his anger burnt; and the [Lord]{.smallcaps}’s fire burnt amongst them, and consumed some of the outskirts of the camp. \bibleverse{2} The people cried to Moses; and Moses prayed to the [Lord]{.smallcaps}, and the fire abated. \bibleverse{3} The name of that place was called Taberah,^[**11:3** Taberah means “burning” ] because the [Lord]{.smallcaps}’s fire burnt amongst them.

## People complain about the food
\bibleverse{4} The mixed multitude that was amongst them lusted exceedingly; and the children of Israel also wept again, and said, “Who will give us meat to eat? \bibleverse{5} We remember the fish, which we ate in Egypt for nothing; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic; \bibleverse{6} but now we have lost our appetite. There is nothing at all except this manna to look at.” \bibleverse{7} The manna was like coriander seed, and it looked like bdellium.^[**11:7** Bdellium is a resin extracted from certain African trees.] \bibleverse{8} The people went around, gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in mortars, and boiled it in pots, and made cakes of it. Its taste was like the taste of fresh oil. \bibleverse{9} When the dew fell on the camp in the night, the manna fell on it.

## Moses' lament before God
\bibleverse{10} Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families, every man at the door of his tent; and the [Lord]{.smallcaps}’s anger burnt greatly; and Moses was displeased. \bibleverse{11} Moses said to the [Lord]{.smallcaps}, “Why have you treated your servant so badly? Why haven’t I found favour in your sight, that you lay the burden of all this people on me? \bibleverse{12} Have I conceived all this people? Have I brought them out, that you should tell me, ‘Carry them in your bosom, as a nurse carries a nursing infant, to the land which you swore to their fathers?’ \bibleverse{13} Where could I get meat to give all these people? For they weep before me, saying, ‘Give us meat, that we may eat.’ \bibleverse{14} I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me. \bibleverse{15} If you treat me this way, please kill me right now, if I have found favour in your sight; and don’t let me see my wretchedness.”

## Ordinance of God (appointment of seventy attendants of Moses) God's promise of donated meat; Moses' incredulous response
\bibleverse{16} The [Lord]{.smallcaps} said to Moses, “Gather to me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom you know to be the elders of the people and officers over them; and bring them to the Tent of Meeting, that they may stand there with you. \bibleverse{17} I will come down and talk with you there. I will take of the Spirit which is on you, and will put it on them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with you, that you don’t bear it yourself alone. \bibleverse{18} “Say to the people, ‘Sanctify yourselves in preparation for tomorrow, and you will eat meat; for you have wept in the ears of the [Lord]{.smallcaps}, saying, “Who will give us meat to eat? For it was well with us in Egypt.” Therefore the [Lord]{.smallcaps} will give you meat, and you will eat. \bibleverse{19} You will not eat just one day, or two days, or five days, or ten days, or twenty days, \bibleverse{20} but a whole month, until it comes out at your nostrils, and it is loathsome to you; because you have rejected the [Lord]{.smallcaps} who is amongst you, and have wept before him, saying, “Why did we come out of Egypt?”’” \bibleverse{21} Moses said, “The people, amongst whom I am, are six hundred thousand men on foot; and you have said, ‘I will give them meat, that they may eat a whole month.’ \bibleverse{22} Shall flocks and herds be slaughtered for them, to be sufficient for them? Shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to be sufficient for them?” \bibleverse{23} The [Lord]{.smallcaps} said to Moses, “Has the [Lord]{.smallcaps}’s hand grown short? Now you will see whether my word will happen to you or not.”

## The prophetic enthusiasm of the seventy elders
\bibleverse{24} Moses went out, and told the people the [Lord]{.smallcaps}’s words; and he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them around the Tent. \bibleverse{25} The [Lord]{.smallcaps} came down in the cloud, and spoke to him, and took of the Spirit that was on him, and put it on the seventy elders. When the Spirit rested on them, they prophesied, but they did so no more. \bibleverse{26} But two men remained in the camp. The name of one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad; and the Spirit rested on them. They were of those who were written, but had not gone out to the Tent; and they prophesied in the camp. \bibleverse{27} A young man ran, and told Moses, and said, “Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp!” \bibleverse{28} Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, one of his chosen men, answered, “My lord Moses, forbid them!” \bibleverse{29} Moses said to him, “Are you jealous for my sake? I wish that all the [Lord]{.smallcaps}’s people were prophets, that the [Lord]{.smallcaps} would put his Spirit on them!” \bibleverse{30} Moses went into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.

## Quail feeding; God's Judgment; the tombs of pleasure
\bibleverse{31} A wind from the [Lord]{.smallcaps} went out and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, about a day’s journey on this side, and a day’s journey on the other side, around the camp, and about two cubits^[**11:31** A cubit is the length from the tip of the middle finger to the elbow on a man’s arm, or about 18 inches or 46 centimetres.] above the surface of the earth. \bibleverse{32} The people rose up all that day, and all of that night, and all the next day, and gathered the quails. He who gathered least gathered ten homers;^[**11:32** 1 homer is about 220 litres or 6 bushels] and they spread them all out for themselves around the camp. \bibleverse{33} While the meat was still between their teeth, before it was chewed, the [Lord]{.smallcaps}’s anger burnt against the people, and the [Lord]{.smallcaps} struck the people with a very great plague. \bibleverse{34} The name of that place was called Kibroth Hattaavah,^[**11:34** Kibroth Hattaavah means “graves of lust”] because there they buried the people who lusted. \bibleverse{35} From Kibroth Hattaavah the people travelled to Hazeroth; and they stayed at Hazeroth. 

## The rebellion of Miriam and Aaron against Moses
# 12 
\bibleverse{1} Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he had married; for he had married a Cushite woman. \bibleverse{2} They said, “Has the [Lord]{.smallcaps} indeed spoken only with Moses? Hasn’t he spoken also with us?” And the [Lord]{.smallcaps} heard it. \bibleverse{3} Now the man Moses was very humble, more than all the men who were on the surface of the earth.

## God is defending Moses; Miriam's punishment
\bibleverse{4} The [Lord]{.smallcaps} spoke suddenly to Moses, to Aaron, and to Miriam, “You three come out to the Tent of Meeting!” The three of them came out. \bibleverse{5} The [Lord]{.smallcaps} came down in a pillar of cloud, and stood at the door of the Tent, and called Aaron and Miriam; and they both came forward. \bibleverse{6} He said, “Now hear my words. If there is a prophet amongst you, I, the [Lord]{.smallcaps}, will make myself known to him in a vision. I will speak with him in a dream. \bibleverse{7} My servant Moses is not so. He is faithful in all my house. \bibleverse{8} With him, I will speak mouth to mouth, even plainly, and not in riddles; and he shall see the [Lord]{.smallcaps}’s form. Why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant, against Moses?” \bibleverse{9} The [Lord]{.smallcaps}’s anger burnt against them; and he departed. \bibleverse{10} The cloud departed from over the Tent; and behold, Miriam was leprous, as white as snow. Aaron looked at Miriam, and behold, she was leprous.

## The intercession of Aaron and Moses; God's answer; Miriam's healing; Arrival in the Paran desert
\bibleverse{11} Aaron said to Moses, “Oh, my lord, please don’t count this sin against us, in which we have done foolishly, and in which we have sinned. \bibleverse{12} Let her not, I pray, be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed when he comes out of his mother’s womb.” \bibleverse{13} Moses cried to the [Lord]{.smallcaps}, saying, “Heal her, God, I beg you!” \bibleverse{14} The [Lord]{.smallcaps} said to Moses, “If her father had but spit in her face, shouldn’t she be ashamed seven days? Let her be shut up outside of the camp seven days, and after that she shall be brought in again.” \bibleverse{15} Miriam was shut up outside of the camp seven days, and the people didn’t travel until Miriam was brought in again. \bibleverse{16} Afterward the people travelled from Hazeroth, and encamped in the wilderness of Paran. 

## Dispatch of the Twelve Scouts
# 13 
\bibleverse{1} The [Lord]{.smallcaps} spoke to Moses, saying, \bibleverse{2} “Send men, that they may spy out the land of Canaan, which I give to the children of Israel. Of every tribe of their fathers, you shall send a man, every one a prince amongst them.” \bibleverse{3} Moses sent them from the wilderness of Paran according to the commandment of the [Lord]{.smallcaps}. All of them were men who were heads of the children of Israel. \bibleverse{4} These were their names: Of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur. \bibleverse{5} Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori. \bibleverse{6} Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh. \bibleverse{7} Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph. \bibleverse{8} Of the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Nun. \bibleverse{9} Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu. \bibleverse{10} Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi. \bibleverse{11} Of the tribe of Joseph, of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi. \bibleverse{12} Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli. \bibleverse{13} Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael. \bibleverse{14} Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi. \bibleverse{15} Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi. \bibleverse{16} These are the names of the men who Moses sent to spy out the land. Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun Joshua. \bibleverse{17} Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said to them, “Go up this way by the South, and go up into the hill country.

## Moses' instruction to the spies
\bibleverse{18} See the land, what it is; and the people who dwell therein, whether they are strong or weak, whether they are few or many; \bibleverse{19} and what the land is that they dwell in, whether it is good or bad; and what cities they are that they dwell in, whether in camps, or in strongholds; \bibleverse{20} and what the land is, whether it is fertile or poor, whether there is wood therein, or not. Be courageous, and bring some of the fruit of the land.” Now the time was the time of the first-ripe grapes. \bibleverse{21} So they went up, and spied out the land from the wilderness of Zin to Rehob, to the entrance of Hamath.

## Exploring the Earth
\bibleverse{22} They went up by the South, and came to Hebron; and Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were there. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.) \bibleverse{23} They came to the valley of Eshcol, and cut down from there a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bore it on a staff between two. They also brought some of the pomegranates and figs. \bibleverse{24} That place was called the valley of Eshcol, because of the cluster which the children of Israel cut down from there. \bibleverse{25} They returned from spying out the land at the end of forty days.

## Return and report of the emissaries
\bibleverse{26} They went and came to Moses, to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, to the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word to them and to all the congregation. They showed them the fruit of the land. \bibleverse{27} They told him, and said, “We came to the land where you sent us. Surely it flows with milk and honey, and this is its fruit. \bibleverse{28} However, the people who dwell in the land are strong, and the cities are fortified and very large. Moreover, we saw the children of Anak there. \bibleverse{29} Amalek dwells in the land of the South. The Hittite, the Jebusite, and the Amorite dwell in the hill country. The Canaanite dwells by the sea, and along the side of the Jordan.” \bibleverse{30} Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, “Let’s go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it!”

## Caleb's reassuring words and the discouraging words of the other explorers
\bibleverse{31} But the men who went up with him said, “We aren’t able to go up against the people; for they are stronger than we.” \bibleverse{32} They brought up an evil report of the land which they had spied out to the children of Israel, saying, “The land, through which we have gone to spy it out, is a land that eats up its inhabitants; and all the people who we saw in it are men of great stature. \bibleverse{33} There we saw the Nephilim,^[**13:33** or, giants] the sons of Anak, who come from the Nephilim.^[**13:33** or, giants] We were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.”

## The effect of the report on people
# 14 
\bibleverse{1} All the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night. \bibleverse{2} All the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron. The whole congregation said to them, “We wish that we had died in the land of Egypt, or that we had died in this wilderness! \bibleverse{3} Why does the [Lord]{.smallcaps} bring us to this land, to fall by the sword? Our wives and our little ones will be captured or killed! Wouldn’t it be better for us to return into Egypt?” \bibleverse{4} They said to one another, “Let’s choose a leader, and let’s return into Egypt.” \bibleverse{5} Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel.

## Joshua and Caleb's failed appeasement attempt
\bibleverse{6} Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, who were of those who spied out the land, tore their clothes. \bibleverse{7} They spoke to all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, “The land, which we passed through to spy it out, is an exceedingly good land. \bibleverse{8} If the [Lord]{.smallcaps} delights in us, then he will bring us into this land, and give it to us: a land which flows with milk and honey. \bibleverse{9} Only don’t rebel against the [Lord]{.smallcaps}, neither fear the people of the land; for they are bread for us. Their defence is removed from over them, and the [Lord]{.smallcaps} is with us. Don’t fear them.”

## God's wrath; the successful intercession of Moses; divine judgment
\bibleverse{10} But all the congregation threatened to stone them with stones. The [Lord]{.smallcaps}’s glory appeared in the Tent of Meeting to all the children of Israel. \bibleverse{11} The [Lord]{.smallcaps} said to Moses, “How long will this people despise me? How long will they not believe in me, for all the signs which I have worked amongst them? \bibleverse{12} I will strike them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of you a nation greater and mightier than they.” \bibleverse{13} Moses said to the [Lord]{.smallcaps}, “Then the Egyptians will hear it; for you brought up this people in your might from amongst them. \bibleverse{14} They will tell it to the inhabitants of this land. They have heard that you [Lord]{.smallcaps} are amongst this people; for you [Lord]{.smallcaps} are seen face to face, and your cloud stands over them, and you go before them, in a pillar of cloud by day, and in a pillar of fire by night. \bibleverse{15} Now if you killed this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of you will speak, saying, \bibleverse{16} ‘Because the [Lord]{.smallcaps} was not able to bring this people into the land which he swore to them, therefore he has slain them in the wilderness.’ \bibleverse{17} Now please let the power of the Lord^[**14:17** The word translated “Lord” is “Adonai.”] be great, according as you have spoken, saying, \bibleverse{18} ‘The [Lord]{.smallcaps} is slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness, forgiving iniquity and disobedience; and he will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, on the third and on the fourth generation.’ \bibleverse{19} Please pardon the iniquity of this people according to the greatness of your loving kindness, and just as you have forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now.” \bibleverse{20} The [Lord]{.smallcaps} said, “I have pardoned according to your word; \bibleverse{21} but in very deed—as I live, and as all the earth shall be filled with the [Lord]{.smallcaps}’s glory— \bibleverse{22} because all those men who have seen my glory and my signs, which I worked in Egypt and in the wilderness, yet have tempted me these ten times, and have not listened to my voice; \bibleverse{23} surely they shall not see the land which I swore to their fathers, neither shall any of those who despised me see it. \bibleverse{24} But my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and has followed me fully, him I will bring into the land into which he went. His offspring shall possess it. \bibleverse{25} Since the Amalekite and the Canaanite dwell in the valley, tomorrow turn and go into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea.”

## God's punishment for people and spies is specified in more detail
\bibleverse{26} The [Lord]{.smallcaps} spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying, \bibleverse{27} “How long shall I bear with this evil congregation that complain against me? I have heard the complaints of the children of Israel, which they complain against me. \bibleverse{28} Tell them, ‘As I live, says the [Lord]{.smallcaps}, surely as you have spoken in my ears, so I will do to you. \bibleverse{29} Your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness; and all who were counted of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward, who have complained against me, \bibleverse{30} surely you shall not come into the land concerning which I swore that I would make you dwell therein, except Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun. \bibleverse{31} But I will bring in your little ones that you said should be captured or killed, and they shall know the land which you have rejected. \bibleverse{32} But as for you, your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness. \bibleverse{33} Your children shall be wanderers in the wilderness forty years, and shall bear your prostitution, until your dead bodies are consumed in the wilderness. \bibleverse{34} After the number of the days in which you spied out the land, even forty days, for every day a year, you will bear your iniquities, even forty years, and you will know my alienation.’ \bibleverse{35} I, the [Lord]{.smallcaps}, have spoken. I will surely do this to all this evil congregation who are gathered together against me. In this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.”

## Sudden death of the spies except Joshua and Caleb
\bibleverse{36} The men whom Moses sent to spy out the land, who returned and made all the congregation to murmur against him by bringing up an evil report against the land, \bibleverse{37} even those men who brought up an evil report of the land, died by the plague before the [Lord]{.smallcaps}. \bibleverse{38} But Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh remained alive of those men who went to spy out the land.

## Repentance of the people; the unsuccessful attempt to penetrate the enemy country
\bibleverse{39} Moses told these words to all the children of Israel, and the people mourned greatly. \bibleverse{40} They rose up early in the morning and went up to the top of the mountain, saying, “Behold, we are here, and will go up to the place which the [Lord]{.smallcaps} has promised; for we have sinned.” \bibleverse{41} Moses said, “Why now do you disobey the commandment of the [Lord]{.smallcaps}, since it shall not prosper? \bibleverse{42} Don’t go up, for the [Lord]{.smallcaps} isn’t amongst you; that way you won’t be struck down before your enemies. \bibleverse{43} For there the Amalekite and the Canaanite are before you, and you will fall by the sword because you turned back from following the [Lord]{.smallcaps}; therefore the [Lord]{.smallcaps} will not be with you.” \bibleverse{44} But they presumed to go up to the top of the mountain. Nevertheless, the ark of the [Lord]{.smallcaps}’s covenant and Moses didn’t depart out of the camp. \bibleverse{45} Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites who lived in that mountain, and struck them and beat them down even to Hormah. 

## Regulations Regarding Food and Drink Offerings in Addition to Burnt Offerings and Salvation Offerings
# 15 
\bibleverse{1} The [Lord]{.smallcaps} spoke to Moses, saying, \bibleverse{2} “Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, ‘When you have come into the land of your habitations, which I give to you, \bibleverse{3} and will make an offering by fire to the [Lord]{.smallcaps}—a burnt offering, or a sacrifice, to accomplish a vow, or as a free will offering, or in your set feasts, to make a pleasant aroma to the [Lord]{.smallcaps}, of the herd, or of the flock— \bibleverse{4} then he who offers his offering shall offer to the [Lord]{.smallcaps} a meal offering of one tenth of an ephah^[**15:4** 1 ephah is about 22 litres or about 2/3 of a bushel] of fine flour mixed with one fourth of a hin^[**15:4** A hin is about 6.5 litres or 1.7 gallons.] of oil. \bibleverse{5} You shall prepare wine for the drink offering, one fourth of a hin, with the burnt offering or for the sacrifice, for each lamb. \bibleverse{6} “‘For a ram, you shall prepare for a meal offering two tenths of an ephah^[**15:6** 1 ephah is about 22 litres or about 2/3 of a bushel] of fine flour mixed with the third part of a hin of oil; \bibleverse{7} and for the drink offering you shall offer the third part of a hin of wine, of a pleasant aroma to the [Lord]{.smallcaps}. \bibleverse{8} When you prepare a bull for a burnt offering or for a sacrifice, to accomplish a vow, or for peace offerings to the [Lord]{.smallcaps}, \bibleverse{9} then he shall offer with the bull a meal offering of three tenths of an ephah^[**15:9** 1 ephah is about 22 litres or about 2/3 of a bushel] of fine flour mixed with half a hin of oil; \bibleverse{10} and you shall offer for the drink offering half a hin of wine, for an offering made by fire, of a pleasant aroma to the [Lord]{.smallcaps}. \bibleverse{11} Thus it shall be done for each bull, for each ram, for each of the male lambs, or of the young goats. \bibleverse{12} According to the number that you shall prepare, so you shall do to everyone according to their number. \bibleverse{13} “‘All who are native-born shall do these things in this way, in offering an offering made by fire, of a pleasant aroma to the [Lord]{.smallcaps}. \bibleverse{14} If a stranger lives as a foreigner with you, or whoever may be amongst you throughout your generations, and will offer an offering made by fire, of a pleasant aroma to the [Lord]{.smallcaps}, as you do, so he shall do. \bibleverse{15} For the assembly, there shall be one statute for you and for the stranger who lives as a foreigner, a statute forever throughout your generations. As you are, so the foreigner shall be before the [Lord]{.smallcaps}. \bibleverse{16} One law and one ordinance shall be for you and for the stranger who lives as a foreigner with you.’”

## Arrangement on the first cakes
\bibleverse{17} The [Lord]{.smallcaps} spoke to Moses, saying, \bibleverse{18} “Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, ‘When you come into the land where I bring you, \bibleverse{19} then it shall be that when you eat of the bread of the land, you shall offer up a wave offering to the [Lord]{.smallcaps}. \bibleverse{20} Of the first of your dough you shall offer up a cake for a wave offering. As the wave offering of the threshing floor, so you shall heave it. \bibleverse{21} Of the first of your dough, you shall give to the [Lord]{.smallcaps} a wave offering throughout your generations.

## Rules regarding sin offerings for unintentionally doing wrong; Impunity for intentional violations
\bibleverse{22} “‘When you err, and don’t observe all these commandments which the [Lord]{.smallcaps} has spoken to Moses— \bibleverse{23} even all that the [Lord]{.smallcaps} has commanded you by Moses, from the day that the [Lord]{.smallcaps} gave commandment and onward throughout your generations— \bibleverse{24} then it shall be, if it was done unwittingly, without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one young bull for a burnt offering, for a pleasant aroma to the [Lord]{.smallcaps}, with its meal offering and its drink offering, according to the ordinance, and one male goat for a sin offering. \bibleverse{25} The priest shall make atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel, and they shall be forgiven; for it was an error, and they have brought their offering, an offering made by fire to the [Lord]{.smallcaps}, and their sin offering before the [Lord]{.smallcaps}, for their error. \bibleverse{26} All the congregation of the children of Israel shall be forgiven, as well as the stranger who lives as a foreigner amongst them; for with regard to all the people, it was done unwittingly. \bibleverse{27} “‘If a person sins unwittingly, then he shall offer a female goat a year old for a sin offering. \bibleverse{28} The priest shall make atonement for the soul who errs when he sins unwittingly before the [Lord]{.smallcaps}. He shall make atonement for him; and he shall be forgiven. \bibleverse{29} You shall have one law for him who does anything unwittingly, for him who is native-born amongst the children of Israel, and for the stranger who lives as a foreigner amongst them. \bibleverse{30} “‘But the soul who does anything with a high hand, whether he is native-born or a foreigner, blasphemes the [Lord]{.smallcaps}. That soul shall be cut off from amongst his people. \bibleverse{31} Because he has despised the [Lord]{.smallcaps}’s word, and has broken his commandment, that soul shall be utterly cut off. His iniquity shall be on him.’”

\bibleverse{32} While the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man gathering sticks on the Sabbath day. \bibleverse{33} Those who found him gathering sticks brought him to Moses and Aaron, and to all the congregation. \bibleverse{34} They put him in custody, because it had not been declared what should be done to him. \bibleverse{35} The [Lord]{.smallcaps} said to Moses, “The man shall surely be put to death. All the congregation shall stone him with stones outside of the camp.” \bibleverse{36} All the congregation brought him outside of the camp, and stoned him to death with stones, as the [Lord]{.smallcaps} commanded Moses.

## Ordinance on tassels to be attached to the ends of clothing
\bibleverse{37} The [Lord]{.smallcaps} spoke to Moses, saying, \bibleverse{38} “Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them that they should make themselves fringes^[**15:38** or, tassels (Hebrew \hebrew{צִיצִ֛ת})] on the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put on the fringe^[**15:38** or, tassel] of each border a cord of blue. \bibleverse{39} It shall be to you for a fringe,^[**15:39** or, tassel] that you may see it, and remember all the [Lord]{.smallcaps}’s commandments, and do them; and that you don’t follow your own heart and your own eyes, after which you used to play the prostitute; \bibleverse{40} so that you may remember and do all my commandments, and be holy to your God. \bibleverse{41} I am the [Lord]{.smallcaps} your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the [Lord]{.smallcaps} your God.”

## The outrage of Korah and the Reubenites
# 16 
\bibleverse{1} Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, with Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took some men. \bibleverse{2} They rose up before Moses, with some of the children of Israel, two hundred and fifty princes of the congregation, called to the assembly, men of renown. \bibleverse{3} They assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said to them, “You take too much on yourself, since all the congregation are holy, everyone of them, and the [Lord]{.smallcaps} is amongst them! Why do you lift yourselves up above the [Lord]{.smallcaps}’s assembly?”

## Moses confronts Korah's group and announces a divine judgment in the sanctuary
\bibleverse{4} When Moses heard it, he fell on his face. \bibleverse{5} He said to Korah and to all his company, “In the morning, the [Lord]{.smallcaps} will show who are his, and who is holy, and will cause him to come near to him. Even him whom he shall choose, he will cause to come near to him. \bibleverse{6} Do this: have Korah and all his company take censers, \bibleverse{7} put fire in them, and put incense on them before the [Lord]{.smallcaps} tomorrow. It shall be that the man whom the [Lord]{.smallcaps} chooses, he shall be holy. You have gone too far, you sons of Levi!” \bibleverse{8} Moses said to Korah, “Hear now, you sons of Levi! \bibleverse{9} Is it a small thing to you that the God of Israel has separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to himself, to do the service of the [Lord]{.smallcaps}’s tabernacle, and to stand before the congregation to minister to them; \bibleverse{10} and that he has brought you near, and all your brothers the sons of Levi with you? Do you seek the priesthood also? \bibleverse{11} Therefore you and all your company have gathered together against the [Lord]{.smallcaps}! What is Aaron that you complain against him?”

## Dathan and Abiram scoff at Moses' invitation; Moses prayer to God
\bibleverse{12} Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab; and they said, “We won’t come up! \bibleverse{13} Is it a small thing that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, but you must also make yourself a prince over us? \bibleverse{14} Moreover you haven’t brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor given us inheritance of fields and vineyards. Will you put out the eyes of these men? We won’t come up.” \bibleverse{15} Moses was very angry, and said to the [Lord]{.smallcaps}, “Don’t respect their offering. I have not taken one donkey from them, neither have I hurt one of them.”

## Moses summons Korah and his companions to perform the sacrifice; The appearance of the glory of God; Intercession of Moses
\bibleverse{16} Moses said to Korah, “You and all your company go before the [Lord]{.smallcaps}, you, and they, and Aaron, tomorrow. \bibleverse{17} Each man take his censer and put incense on it, and each man bring before the [Lord]{.smallcaps} his censer, two hundred and fifty censers; you also, and Aaron, each with his censer.” \bibleverse{18} They each took his censer, and put fire in it, and laid incense on it, and stood at the door of the Tent of Meeting with Moses and Aaron. \bibleverse{19} Korah assembled all the congregation opposite them to the door of the Tent of Meeting. The [Lord]{.smallcaps}’s glory appeared to all the congregation. \bibleverse{20} The [Lord]{.smallcaps} spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying, \bibleverse{21} “Separate yourselves from amongst this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment!” \bibleverse{22} They fell on their faces, and said, “God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and will you be angry with all the congregation?” \bibleverse{23} The [Lord]{.smallcaps} spoke to Moses, saying, \bibleverse{24} “Speak to the congregation, saying, ‘Get away from around the tent of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram!’”

## Moses with Dathan and Abiram; divine judgment on them and on Korah's 250 companions
\bibleverse{25} Moses rose up and went to Dathan and Abiram; and the elders of Israel followed him. \bibleverse{26} He spoke to the congregation, saying, “Depart, please, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest you be consumed in all their sins!” \bibleverse{27} So they went away from the tent of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side. Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood at the door of their tents with their wives, their sons, and their little ones. \bibleverse{28} Moses said, “Hereby you shall know that the [Lord]{.smallcaps} has sent me to do all these works; for they are not from my own mind. \bibleverse{29} If these men die the common death of all men, or if they experience what all men experience, then the [Lord]{.smallcaps} hasn’t sent me. \bibleverse{30} But if the [Lord]{.smallcaps} makes a new thing, and the ground opens its mouth, and swallows them up with all that belong to them, and they go down alive into Sheol,^[**16:30** Sheol is the place of the dead.] then you shall understand that these men have despised the [Lord]{.smallcaps}.” \bibleverse{31} As he finished speaking all these words, the ground that was under them split apart. \bibleverse{32} The earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up with their households, all of Korah’s men, and all their goods. \bibleverse{33} So they, and all that belonged to them went down alive into Sheol.^[**16:33** Sheol is the place of the dead.] The earth closed on them, and they perished from amongst the assembly. \bibleverse{34} All Israel that were around them fled at their cry; for they said, “Lest the earth swallow us up!” \bibleverse{35} Fire came out from the [Lord]{.smallcaps}, and devoured the two hundred and fifty men who offered the incense.

## The use of the 250 steaming pots by Korah and his companions as a cover for the sacrificial altar
\bibleverse{36} The [Lord]{.smallcaps} spoke to Moses, saying, \bibleverse{37} “Speak to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning, and scatter the fire away from the camp; for they are holy, \bibleverse{38} even the censers of those who sinned against their own lives. Let them be beaten into plates for a covering of the altar, for they offered them before the [Lord]{.smallcaps}. Therefore they are holy. They shall be a sign to the children of Israel.” \bibleverse{39} Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers which those who were burnt had offered; and they beat them out for a covering of the altar, \bibleverse{40} to be a memorial to the children of Israel, to the end that no stranger who isn’t of the offspring of Aaron, would come near to burn incense before the [Lord]{.smallcaps}, that he not be as Korah and as his company; as the [Lord]{.smallcaps} spoke to him by Moses.

## Punishment of the community complaining about the disappearance of the rioters; the atonement made by Moses and Aaron
\bibleverse{41} But on the next day all the congregation of the children of Israel complained against Moses and against Aaron, saying, “You have killed the [Lord]{.smallcaps}’s people!” \bibleverse{42} When the congregation was assembled against Moses and against Aaron, they looked towards the Tent of Meeting. Behold, the cloud covered it, and the [Lord]{.smallcaps}’s glory appeared. \bibleverse{43} Moses and Aaron came to the front of the Tent of Meeting. \bibleverse{44} The [Lord]{.smallcaps} spoke to Moses, saying, \bibleverse{45} “Get away from amongst this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment!” They fell on their faces. \bibleverse{46} Moses said to Aaron, “Take your censer, put fire from the altar in it, lay incense on it, carry it quickly to the congregation, and make atonement for them; for wrath has gone out from the [Lord]{.smallcaps}! The plague has begun.” \bibleverse{47} Aaron did as Moses said, and ran into the middle of the assembly. The plague had already begun amongst the people. He put on the incense, and made atonement for the people. \bibleverse{48} He stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed. \bibleverse{49} Now those who died by the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, in addition to those who died about the matter of Korah. \bibleverse{50} Aaron returned to Moses to the door of the Tent of Meeting, and the plague was stopped. 

## Proof of Aaron's priestly right by the wonderful rungs of his staff
# 17 
\bibleverse{1} The [Lord]{.smallcaps} spoke to Moses, saying, \bibleverse{2} “Speak to the children of Israel, and take rods from them, one for each fathers’ house, of all their princes according to their fathers’ houses, twelve rods. Write each man’s name on his rod. \bibleverse{3} You shall write Aaron’s name on Levi’s rod. There shall be one rod for each head of their fathers’ houses. \bibleverse{4} You shall lay them up in the Tent of Meeting before the covenant, where I meet with you. \bibleverse{5} It shall happen that the rod of the man whom I shall choose shall bud. I will make the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against you, cease from me.” \bibleverse{6} Moses spoke to the children of Israel; and all their princes gave him rods, for each prince one, according to their fathers’ houses, a total of twelve rods. Aaron’s rod was amongst their rods. \bibleverse{7} Moses laid up the rods before the [Lord]{.smallcaps} in the Tent of the Testimony. \bibleverse{8} On the next day, Moses went into the Tent of the Testimony; and behold, Aaron’s rod for the house of Levi had sprouted, budded, produced blossoms, and bore ripe almonds. \bibleverse{9} Moses brought out all the rods from before the [Lord]{.smallcaps} to all the children of Israel. They looked, and each man took his rod. \bibleverse{10} The [Lord]{.smallcaps} said to Moses, “Put back the rod of Aaron before the covenant, to be kept for a token against the children of rebellion; that you may make an end of their complaining against me, that they not die.” \bibleverse{11} Moses did so. As the [Lord]{.smallcaps} commanded him, so he did. \bibleverse{12} The children of Israel spoke to Moses, saying, “Behold, we perish! We are undone! We are all undone! \bibleverse{13} Everyone who keeps approaching the [Lord]{.smallcaps}’s tabernacle, dies! Will we all perish?” 

## General ordinances on the duties of the priests and their assistants, the Levites
# 18 
\bibleverse{1} The [Lord]{.smallcaps} said to Aaron, “You and your sons and your fathers’ house with you shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary; and you and your sons with you shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood. \bibleverse{2} Bring your brothers also, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of your father, near with you, that they may be joined to you, and minister to you; but you and your sons with you shall be before the Tent of the Testimony. \bibleverse{3} They shall keep your commands and the duty of the whole Tent; only they shall not come near to the vessels of the sanctuary and to the altar, that they not die, neither they nor you. \bibleverse{4} They shall be joined to you and keep the responsibility of the Tent of Meeting, for all the service of the Tent. A stranger shall not come near to you. \bibleverse{5} “You shall perform the duty of the sanctuary and the duty of the altar, that there be no more wrath on the children of Israel. \bibleverse{6} Behold, I myself have taken your brothers the Levites from amongst the children of Israel. They are a gift to you, dedicated to the [Lord]{.smallcaps}, to do the service of the Tent of Meeting. \bibleverse{7} You and your sons with you shall keep your priesthood for everything of the altar, and for that within the veil. You shall serve. I give you the service of the priesthood as a gift. The stranger who comes near shall be put to death.”

## The income of the priests
\bibleverse{8} The [Lord]{.smallcaps} spoke to Aaron, “Behold, I myself have given you the command of my wave offerings, even all the holy things of the children of Israel. I have given them to you by reason of the anointing, and to your sons, as a portion forever. \bibleverse{9} This shall be yours of the most holy things from the fire: every offering of theirs, even every meal offering of theirs, and every sin offering of theirs, and every trespass offering of theirs, which they shall render to me, shall be most holy for you and for your sons. \bibleverse{10} You shall eat of it like the most holy things. Every male shall eat of it. It shall be holy to you. \bibleverse{11} “This is yours, too: the wave offering of their gift, even all the wave offerings of the children of Israel. I have given them to you, and to your sons and to your daughters with you, as a portion forever. Everyone who is clean in your house shall eat of it. \bibleverse{12} “I have given to you all the best of the oil, all the best of the vintage, and of the grain, the first fruits of them which they give to the [Lord]{.smallcaps}. \bibleverse{13} The first-ripe fruits of all that is in their land, which they bring to the [Lord]{.smallcaps}, shall be yours. Everyone who is clean in your house shall eat of it. \bibleverse{14} “Everything devoted in Israel shall be yours. \bibleverse{15} Everything that opens the womb, of all flesh which they offer to the [Lord]{.smallcaps}, both of man and animal, shall be yours. Nevertheless, you shall surely redeem the firstborn of man, and you shall redeem the firstborn of unclean animals. \bibleverse{16} You shall redeem those who are to be redeemed of them from a month old, according to your estimation, for five shekels of money, according to the shekel^[**18:16** A shekel is about 10 grams or about 0.35 ounces.] of the sanctuary, which weighs twenty gerahs.^[**18:16** A gerah is about 0.5 grams or about 7.7 grains.] \bibleverse{17} “But you shall not redeem the firstborn of a cow, or the firstborn of a sheep, or the firstborn of a goat. They are holy. You shall sprinkle their blood on the altar, and shall burn their fat for an offering made by fire, for a pleasant aroma to the [Lord]{.smallcaps}. \bibleverse{18} Their meat shall be yours, as the wave offering breast and as the right thigh, it shall be yours. \bibleverse{19} All the wave offerings of the holy things which the children of Israel offer to the [Lord]{.smallcaps}, I have given you and your sons and your daughters with you, as a portion forever. It is a covenant of salt forever before the [Lord]{.smallcaps} to you and to your offspring with you.”

## Assignment of the tithe to the Levites for the denial of the land
\bibleverse{20} The [Lord]{.smallcaps} said to Aaron, “You shall have no inheritance in their land, neither shall you have any portion amongst them. I am your portion and your inheritance amongst the children of Israel. \bibleverse{21} “To the children of Levi, behold, I have given all the tithe in Israel for an inheritance, in return for their service which they serve, even the service of the Tent of Meeting. \bibleverse{22} Henceforth the children of Israel shall not come near the Tent of Meeting, lest they bear sin, and die. \bibleverse{23} But the Levites shall do the service of the Tent of Meeting, and they shall bear their iniquity. It shall be a statute forever throughout your generations. Amongst the children of Israel, they shall have no inheritance. \bibleverse{24} For the tithe of the children of Israel, which they offer as a wave offering to the [Lord]{.smallcaps}, I have given to the Levites for an inheritance. Therefore I have said to them, ‘Amongst the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.’”

## The tithe of the income of the Levites to the priests
\bibleverse{25} The [Lord]{.smallcaps} spoke to Moses, saying, \bibleverse{26} “Moreover you shall speak to the Levites, and tell them, ‘When you take of the children of Israel the tithe which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then you shall offer up a wave offering of it for the [Lord]{.smallcaps}, a tithe of the tithe. \bibleverse{27} Your wave offering shall be credited to you, as though it were the grain of the threshing floor, and as the fullness of the wine press. \bibleverse{28} Thus you also shall offer a wave offering to the [Lord]{.smallcaps} of all your tithes, which you receive of the children of Israel; and of it you shall give the [Lord]{.smallcaps}’s wave offering to Aaron the priest. \bibleverse{29} Out of all your gifts, you shall offer every wave offering to the [Lord]{.smallcaps}, of all its best parts, even the holy part of it.’ \bibleverse{30} “Therefore you shall tell them, ‘When you heave its best from it, then it shall be credited to the Levites as the increase of the threshing floor, and as the increase of the wine press. \bibleverse{31} You may eat it anywhere, you and your households, for it is your reward in return for your service in the Tent of Meeting. \bibleverse{32} You shall bear no sin by reason of it, when you have heaved from it its best. You shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, that you not die.’” 

## Preparation and use of cleaning water
# 19 
\bibleverse{1} The [Lord]{.smallcaps} spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying, \bibleverse{2} “This is the statute of the law which the [Lord]{.smallcaps} has commanded. Tell the children of Israel to bring you a red heifer without spot, in which is no defect, and which was never yoked. \bibleverse{3} You shall give her to Eleazar the priest, and he shall bring her outside of the camp, and one shall kill her before his face. \bibleverse{4} Eleazar the priest shall take some of her blood with his finger, and sprinkle her blood towards the front of the Tent of Meeting seven times. \bibleverse{5} One shall burn the heifer in his sight; her skin, and her meat, and her blood, with her dung, shall he burn. \bibleverse{6} The priest shall take cedar wood, hyssop, and scarlet, and cast it into the middle of the burning of the heifer. \bibleverse{7} Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp, and the priest shall be unclean until the evening. \bibleverse{8} He who burns her shall wash his clothes in water, and bathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the evening. \bibleverse{9} “A man who is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and lay them up outside of the camp in a clean place; and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for use in water for cleansing impurity. It is a sin offering. \bibleverse{10} He who gathers the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the evening. It shall be to the children of Israel, and to the stranger who lives as a foreigner amongst them, for a statute forever. \bibleverse{11} “He who touches the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days. \bibleverse{12} He shall purify himself with water on the third day, and on the seventh day he shall be clean; but if he doesn’t purify himself the third day, then the seventh day he shall not be clean. \bibleverse{13} Whoever touches a dead person, the body of a man who has died, and doesn’t purify himself, defiles the [Lord]{.smallcaps}’s tabernacle; and that soul shall be cut off from Israel; because the water for impurity was not sprinkled on him, he shall be unclean. His uncleanness is yet on him.

## Instructions on specific cases of contamination and their treatment
\bibleverse{14} “This is the law when a man dies in a tent: everyone who comes into the tent, and everyone who is in the tent, shall be unclean seven days. \bibleverse{15} Every open vessel, which has no covering bound on it, is unclean. \bibleverse{16} “Whoever in the open field touches one who is slain with a sword, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean seven days. \bibleverse{17} “For the unclean, they shall take of the ashes of the burning of the sin offering; and running water shall be poured on them in a vessel. \bibleverse{18} A clean person shall take hyssop, dip it in the water, and sprinkle it on the tent, on all the vessels, on the persons who were there, and on him who touched the bone, or the slain, or the dead, or the grave. \bibleverse{19} The clean person shall sprinkle on the unclean on the third day, and on the seventh day. On the seventh day, he shall purify him. He shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water, and shall be clean at evening. \bibleverse{20} But the man who shall be unclean, and shall not purify himself, that soul shall be cut off from amongst the assembly, because he has defiled the sanctuary of the [Lord]{.smallcaps}. The water for impurity has not been sprinkled on him. He is unclean. \bibleverse{21} It shall be a perpetual statute to them. He who sprinkles the water for impurity shall wash his clothes, and he who touches the water for impurity shall be unclean until evening. \bibleverse{22} “Whatever the unclean person touches shall be unclean; and the soul that touches it shall be unclean until evening.” 

## Arrival at Kade and death of Miriam; renewed complaint of the people; the fateful donation of water from the rock for Moses and Aaron
# 20 
\bibleverse{1} The children of Israel, even the whole congregation, came into the wilderness of Zin in the first month. The people stayed in Kadesh. Miriam died there, and was buried there. \bibleverse{2} There was no water for the congregation; and they assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron. \bibleverse{3} The people quarrelled with Moses, and spoke, saying, “We wish that we had died when our brothers died before the [Lord]{.smallcaps}! \bibleverse{4} Why have you brought the [Lord]{.smallcaps}’s assembly into this wilderness, that we should die there, we and our animals? \bibleverse{5} Why have you made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us in to this evil place? It is no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither is there any water to drink.” \bibleverse{6} Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly to the door of the Tent of Meeting, and fell on their faces. The [Lord]{.smallcaps}’s glory appeared to them. \bibleverse{7} The [Lord]{.smallcaps} spoke to Moses, saying, \bibleverse{8} “Take the rod, and assemble the congregation, you, and Aaron your brother, and speak to the rock before their eyes, that it pour out its water. You shall bring water to them out of the rock; so you shall give the congregation and their livestock drink.” \bibleverse{9} Moses took the rod from before the [Lord]{.smallcaps}, as he commanded him. \bibleverse{10} Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly together before the rock, and he said to them, “Hear now, you rebels! Shall we bring water out of this rock for you?” \bibleverse{11} Moses lifted up his hand, and struck the rock with his rod twice, and water came out abundantly. The congregation and their livestock drank. \bibleverse{12} The [Lord]{.smallcaps} said to Moses and Aaron, “Because you didn’t believe in me, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore you shall not bring this assembly into the land which I have given them.” \bibleverse{13} These are the waters of Meribah;^[**20:13** “Meribah” means “quarrelling”.] because the children of Israel strove with the [Lord]{.smallcaps}, and he was sanctified in them.

## The Edomites refuse to allow passage; Aaron's death
\bibleverse{14} Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom, saying: “Your brother Israel says: You know all the travail that has happened to us; \bibleverse{15} how our fathers went down into Egypt, and we lived in Egypt a long time. The Egyptians mistreated us and our fathers. \bibleverse{16} When we cried to the [Lord]{.smallcaps}, he heard our voice, sent an angel, and brought us out of Egypt. Behold, we are in Kadesh, a city in the edge of your border. \bibleverse{17} “Please let us pass through your land. We will not pass through field or through vineyard, neither will we drink from the water of the wells. We will go along the king’s highway. We will not turn away to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed your border.” \bibleverse{18} Edom said to him, “You shall not pass through me, lest I come out with the sword against you.” \bibleverse{19} The children of Israel said to him, “We will go up by the highway; and if we drink your water, I and my livestock, then I will give its price. Only let me, without doing anything else, pass through on my feet.” \bibleverse{20} He said, “You shall not pass through.” Edom came out against him with many people, and with a strong hand. \bibleverse{21} Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border, so Israel turned away from him.

## The train from Kades to Mount Hor; Aaron's death
\bibleverse{22} They travelled from Kadesh, and the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, came to Mount Hor. \bibleverse{23} The [Lord]{.smallcaps} spoke to Moses and Aaron in Mount Hor, by the border of the land of Edom, saying, \bibleverse{24} “Aaron shall be gathered to his people; for he shall not enter into the land which I have given to the children of Israel, because you rebelled against my word at the waters of Meribah. \bibleverse{25} Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up to Mount Hor; \bibleverse{26} and strip Aaron of his garments, and put them on Eleazar his son. Aaron shall be gathered, and shall die there.” \bibleverse{27} Moses did as the [Lord]{.smallcaps} commanded. They went up onto Mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation. \bibleverse{28} Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them on Eleazar his son. Aaron died there on the top of the mountain, and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain. \bibleverse{29} When all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they wept for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel. 

## Victorious battle with the King of Arad
# 21 
\bibleverse{1} The Canaanite, the king of Arad, who lived in the South, heard that Israel came by the way of Atharim. He fought against Israel, and took some of them captive. \bibleverse{2} Israel vowed a vow to the [Lord]{.smallcaps}, and said, “If you will indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities.” \bibleverse{3} The [Lord]{.smallcaps} listened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities. The name of the place was called Hormah.^[**21:3** “Hormah” means “destruction”.]

## Murmurs of the people; poisonous snakes and the bronze snake
\bibleverse{4} They travelled from Mount Hor by the way to the Red Sea, to go around the land of Edom. The soul of the people was very discouraged because of the journey. \bibleverse{5} The people spoke against God and against Moses: “Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no bread, there is no water, and our soul loathes this disgusting food!” \bibleverse{6} The [Lord]{.smallcaps} sent venomous snakes amongst the people, and they bit the people. Many people of Israel died. \bibleverse{7} The people came to Moses, and said, “We have sinned, because we have spoken against the [Lord]{.smallcaps} and against you. Pray to the [Lord]{.smallcaps}, that he take away the serpents from us.” Moses prayed for the people. \bibleverse{8} The [Lord]{.smallcaps} said to Moses, “Make a venomous snake, and set it on a pole. It shall happen that everyone who is bitten, when he sees it, shall live.” \bibleverse{9} Moses made a serpent of bronze, and set it on the pole. If a serpent had bitten any man, when he looked at the serpent of bronze, he lived.

## The train to the Arnon and the steppes of the Moabites; the fountain song
\bibleverse{10} The children of Israel travelled, and encamped in Oboth. \bibleverse{11} They travelled from Oboth, and encamped at Iyeabarim, in the wilderness which is before Moab, towards the sunrise. \bibleverse{12} From there they travelled, and encamped in the valley of Zered. \bibleverse{13} From there they travelled, and encamped on the other side of the Arnon, which is in the wilderness that comes out of the border of the Amorites; for the Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites. \bibleverse{14} Therefore it is said in The Book of the Wars of the [Lord]{.smallcaps}, “Vaheb in Suphah, the valleys of the Arnon, \bibleverse{15} the slope of the valleys that incline towards the dwelling of Ar, leans on the border of Moab.” \bibleverse{16} From there they travelled to Beer; that is the well of which the [Lord]{.smallcaps} said to Moses, “Gather the people together, and I will give them water.” \bibleverse{17} Then Israel sang this song: “Spring up, well! Sing to it, \bibleverse{18} the well, which the princes dug, which the nobles of the people dug, with the sceptre, and with their poles.” From the wilderness they travelled to Mattanah; \bibleverse{19} and from Mattanah to Nahaliel; and from Nahaliel to Bamoth; \bibleverse{20} and from Bamoth to the valley that is in the field of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looks down on the desert.

## Defeat of the Amorite king Sihon and conquest of his country; Israelite Triumph Song
\bibleverse{21} Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying, \bibleverse{22} “Let me pass through your land. We will not turn away into field or vineyard. We will not drink of the water of the wells. We will go by the king’s highway, until we have passed your border.” \bibleverse{23} Sihon would not allow Israel to pass through his border, but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness, and came to Jahaz. He fought against Israel. \bibleverse{24} Israel struck him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, even to the children of Ammon; for the border of the children of Ammon was fortified. \bibleverse{25} Israel took all these cities. Israel lived in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all its villages. \bibleverse{26} For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even to the Arnon. \bibleverse{27} Therefore those who speak in proverbs say, “Come to Heshbon. Let the city of Sihon be built and established; \bibleverse{28} for a fire has gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon. It has devoured Ar of Moab, The lords of the high places of the Arnon. \bibleverse{29} Woe to you, Moab! You are undone, people of Chemosh! He has given his sons as fugitives, and his daughters into captivity, to Sihon king of the Amorites. \bibleverse{30} We have shot at them. Heshbon has perished even to Dibon. We have laid waste even to Nophah, Which reaches to Medeba.”

## Greater advance of the Israelites; Defeat of King Og of Basan
\bibleverse{31} Thus Israel lived in the land of the Amorites. \bibleverse{32} Moses sent to spy out Jazer. They took its villages, and drove out the Amorites who were there. \bibleverse{33} They turned and went up by the way of Bashan. Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei. \bibleverse{34} The [Lord]{.smallcaps} said to Moses, “Don’t fear him, for I have delivered him into your hand, with all his people, and his land. You shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon.” \bibleverse{35} So they struck him, with his sons and all his people, until there were no survivors; and they possessed his land. 

## Der Moabiterkönig Balak beschließt, Gesandte an Bileam zu schicken
# 22 
\bibleverse{1} The children of Israel travelled, and encamped in the plains of Moab beyond the Jordan at Jericho. \bibleverse{2} Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites. \bibleverse{3} Moab was very afraid of the people, because they were many. Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel. \bibleverse{4} Moab said to the elders of Midian, “Now this multitude will lick up all that is around us, as the ox licks up the grass of the field.” Balak the son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time. \bibleverse{5} He sent messengers to Balaam the son of Beor, to Pethor, which is by the River, to the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, “Behold, there is a people who came out of Egypt. Behold, they cover the surface of the earth, and they are staying opposite me. \bibleverse{6} Please come now therefore, and curse this people for me; for they are too mighty for me. Perhaps I shall prevail, that we may strike them, and that I may drive them out of the land; for I know that he whom you bless is blessed, and he whom you curse is cursed.”

## Balak's first embassy to Balaam unsuccessful; your repeated message
\bibleverse{7} The elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand. They came to Balaam, and spoke to him the words of Balak. \bibleverse{8} He said to them, “Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as the [Lord]{.smallcaps} shall speak to me.” The princes of Moab stayed with Balaam. \bibleverse{9} God came to Balaam, and said, “Who are these men with you?” \bibleverse{10} Balaam said to God, “Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, has said to me, \bibleverse{11} ‘Behold, the people that has come out of Egypt covers the surface of the earth. Now, come curse them for me. Perhaps I shall be able to fight against them, and shall drive them out.’” \bibleverse{12} God said to Balaam, “You shall not go with them. You shall not curse the people, for they are blessed.” \bibleverse{13} Balaam rose up in the morning, and said to the princes of Balak, “Go to your land; for the [Lord]{.smallcaps} refuses to permit me to go with you.” \bibleverse{14} The princes of Moab rose up, and they went to Balak, and said, “Balaam refuses to come with us.” \bibleverse{15} Balak again sent princes, more, and more honourable than they. \bibleverse{16} They came to Balaam, and said to him, “Balak the son of Zippor says, ‘Please let nothing hinder you from coming to me, \bibleverse{17} for I will promote you to very great honour, and whatever you say to me I will do. Please come therefore, and curse this people for me.’” \bibleverse{18} Balaam answered the servants of Balak, “If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I can’t go beyond the word of the [Lord]{.smallcaps} my God, to do less or more. \bibleverse{19} Now therefore please stay here tonight as well, that I may know what else the [Lord]{.smallcaps} will speak to me.” \bibleverse{20} God came to Balaam at night, and said to him, “If the men have come to call you, rise up, go with them; but only the word which I speak to you, that you shall do.” \bibleverse{21} Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his donkey, and went with the princes of Moab.

## Balaam's journey to Moab and the incident with the donkey
\bibleverse{22} God’s anger burnt because he went; and the [Lord]{.smallcaps}’s angel placed himself in the way as an adversary against him. Now he was riding on his donkey, and his two servants were with him. \bibleverse{23} The donkey saw the [Lord]{.smallcaps}’s angel standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand; and the donkey turned out of the path, and went into the field. Balaam struck the donkey, to turn her into the path. \bibleverse{24} Then the [Lord]{.smallcaps}’s angel stood in a narrow path between the vineyards, a wall being on this side, and a wall on that side. \bibleverse{25} The donkey saw the [Lord]{.smallcaps}’s angel, and she thrust herself to the wall, and crushed Balaam’s foot against the wall. He struck her again. \bibleverse{26} The [Lord]{.smallcaps}’s angel went further, and stood in a narrow place, where there was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left. \bibleverse{27} The donkey saw the [Lord]{.smallcaps}’s angel, and she lay down under Balaam. Balaam’s anger burnt, and he struck the donkey with his staff. \bibleverse{28} The [Lord]{.smallcaps} opened the mouth of the donkey, and she said to Balaam, “What have I done to you, that you have struck me these three times?” \bibleverse{29} Balaam said to the donkey, “Because you have mocked me, I wish there were a sword in my hand, for now I would have killed you.” \bibleverse{30} The donkey said to Balaam, “Am I not your donkey, on which you have ridden all your life long until today? Was I ever in the habit of doing so to you?” He said, “No.” \bibleverse{31} Then the [Lord]{.smallcaps} opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the [Lord]{.smallcaps}’s angel standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand; and he bowed his head, and fell on his face. \bibleverse{32} The [Lord]{.smallcaps}’s angel said to him, “Why have you struck your donkey these three times? Behold, I have come out as an adversary, because your way is perverse before me. \bibleverse{33} The donkey saw me, and turned away before me these three times. Unless she had turned away from me, surely now I would have killed you, and saved her alive.” \bibleverse{34} Balaam said to the [Lord]{.smallcaps}’s angel, “I have sinned; for I didn’t know that you stood in the way against me. Now therefore, if it displeases you, I will go back again.” \bibleverse{35} The [Lord]{.smallcaps}’s angel said to Balaam, “Go with the men; but you shall only speak the word that I shall speak to you.” So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.

## Balaam's arrival at Balak
\bibleverse{36} When Balak heard that Balaam had come, he went out to meet him to the City of Moab, which is on the border of the Arnon, which is in the utmost part of the border. \bibleverse{37} Balak said to Balaam, “Didn’t I earnestly send for you to summon you? Why didn’t you come to me? Am I not able indeed to promote you to honour?” \bibleverse{38} Balaam said to Balak, “Behold, I have come to you. Have I now any power at all to speak anything? I will speak the word that God puts in my mouth.” \bibleverse{39} Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kiriath Huzoth. \bibleverse{40} Balak sacrificed cattle and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes who were with him. \bibleverse{41} In the morning, Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal; and he saw from there part of the people. 

## Preparations for divine revelation; Balaam's first saying
# 23 
\bibleverse{1} Balaam said to Balak, “Build here seven altars for me, and prepare here seven bulls and seven rams for me.” \bibleverse{2} Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered on every altar a bull and a ram. \bibleverse{3} Balaam said to Balak, “Stand by your burnt offering, and I will go. Perhaps the [Lord]{.smallcaps} will come to meet me. Whatever he shows me I will tell you.” He went to a bare height. \bibleverse{4} God met Balaam, and he said to him, “I have prepared the seven altars, and I have offered up a bull and a ram on every altar.” \bibleverse{5} The [Lord]{.smallcaps} put a word in Balaam’s mouth, and said, “Return to Balak, and thus you shall speak.” \bibleverse{6} He returned to him, and behold, he was standing by his burnt offering, he, and all the princes of Moab.

## Balaam blesses Israel from Bamot-Baal
\bibleverse{7} He took up his parable, and said, “From Aram has Balak brought me, the king of Moab from the mountains of the East. Come, curse Jacob for me. Come, defy Israel. \bibleverse{8} How shall I curse whom God has not cursed? How shall I defy whom the [Lord]{.smallcaps} has not defied? \bibleverse{9} For from the top of the rocks I see him. From the hills I see him. Behold, it is a people that dwells alone, and shall not be listed amongst the nations. \bibleverse{10} Who can count the dust of Jacob, or count the fourth part of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous! Let my last end be like his!” \bibleverse{11} Balak said to Balaam, “What have you done to me? I took you to curse my enemies, and behold, you have blessed them altogether.” \bibleverse{12} He answered and said, “Must I not take heed to speak that which the [Lord]{.smallcaps} puts in my mouth?”

## Preparations for the new divine revelation; Balaam's second saying
\bibleverse{13} Balak said to him, “Please come with me to another place, where you may see them. You shall see just part of them, and shall not see them all. Curse them from there for me.” \bibleverse{14} He took him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered up a bull and a ram on every altar. \bibleverse{15} He said to Balak, “Stand here by your burnt offering, while I meet God over there.” \bibleverse{16} The [Lord]{.smallcaps} met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, “Return to Balak, and say this.” \bibleverse{17} He came to him, and behold, he was standing by his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab with him. Balak said to him, “What has the [Lord]{.smallcaps} spoken?”

## Balaam blesses Israel from Mount Pisgah
\bibleverse{18} He took up his parable, and said, “Rise up, Balak, and hear! Listen to me, you son of Zippor. \bibleverse{19} God is not a man, that he should lie, nor a son of man, that he should repent. Has he said, and he won’t do it? Or has he spoken, and he won’t make it good? \bibleverse{20} Behold, I have received a command to bless. He has blessed, and I can’t reverse it. \bibleverse{21} He has not seen iniquity in Jacob. Neither has he seen perverseness in Israel. The [Lord]{.smallcaps} his God is with him. The shout of a king is amongst them. \bibleverse{22} God brings them out of Egypt. He has as it were the strength of the wild ox. \bibleverse{23} Surely there is no enchantment with Jacob; Neither is there any divination with Israel. Now it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, ‘What has God done!’ \bibleverse{24} Behold, a people rises up as a lioness. As a lion he lifts himself up. He shall not lie down until he eats of the prey, and drinks the blood of the slain.” \bibleverse{25} Balak said to Balaam, “Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all.” \bibleverse{26} But Balaam answered Balak, “Didn’t I tell you, saying, ‘All that the [Lord]{.smallcaps} speaks, that I must do?’”

## Preparations for the third divine revelation; Balaam's third saying
\bibleverse{27} Balak said to Balaam, “Come now, I will take you to another place; perhaps it will please God that you may curse them for me from there.” \bibleverse{28} Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, that looks down on the desert. \bibleverse{29} Balaam said to Balak, “Build seven altars for me here, and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me here.” \bibleverse{30} Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered up a bull and a ram on every altar. 

## Balaam blesses Israel from Mount Peor
# 24 
\bibleverse{1} When Balaam saw that it pleased the [Lord]{.smallcaps} to bless Israel, he didn’t go, as at the other times, to use divination, but he set his face towards the wilderness. \bibleverse{2} Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel dwelling according to their tribes; and the Spirit of God came on him. \bibleverse{3} He took up his parable, and said, “Balaam the son of Beor says, the man whose eyes are open says; \bibleverse{4} he says, who hears the words of God, who sees the vision of the Almighty, falling down, and having his eyes open: \bibleverse{5} How goodly are your tents, Jacob, and your dwellings, Israel! \bibleverse{6} As valleys they are spread out, as gardens by the riverside, as aloes which the [Lord]{.smallcaps} has planted, as cedar trees beside the waters. \bibleverse{7} Water shall flow from his buckets. His seed shall be in many waters. His king shall be higher than Agag. His kingdom shall be exalted. \bibleverse{8} God brings him out of Egypt. He has as it were the strength of the wild ox. He shall consume the nations his adversaries, shall break their bones in pieces, and pierce them with his arrows. \bibleverse{9} He couched, he lay down as a lion, as a lioness; who shall rouse him up? Everyone who blesses you is blessed. Everyone who curses you is cursed.”

## Balak's anger and Balaam's apology
\bibleverse{10} Balak’s anger burnt against Balaam, and he struck his hands together. Balak said to Balaam, “I called you to curse my enemies, and, behold, you have altogether blessed them these three times. \bibleverse{11} Therefore, flee to your place, now! I thought to promote you to great honour; but, behold, the [Lord]{.smallcaps} has kept you back from honour.” \bibleverse{12} Balaam said to Balak, “Didn’t I also tell your messengers whom you sent to me, saying, \bibleverse{13} ‘If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I can’t go beyond the [Lord]{.smallcaps}’s word, to do either good or bad from my own mind. I will say what the [Lord]{.smallcaps} says’? \bibleverse{14} Now, behold, I go to my people. Come, I will inform you what this people shall do to your people in the latter days.”

## Balaam's fourth saying: the star of Jacob; whose victory over Moab and Edom
\bibleverse{15} He took up his parable, and said, “Balaam the son of Beor says, the man whose eyes are open says; \bibleverse{16} he says, who hears the words of God, knows the knowledge of the Most High, and who sees the vision of the Almighty, falling down, and having his eyes open: \bibleverse{17} I see him, but not now. I see him, but not near. A star will come out of Jacob. A sceptre will rise out of Israel, and shall strike through the corners of Moab, and crush all the sons of Sheth. \bibleverse{18} Edom shall be a possession. Seir, his enemy, also shall be a possession, while Israel does valiantly. \bibleverse{19} Out of Jacob shall one have dominion, and shall destroy the remnant from the city.”

## Proverbs about the Amalekites, Kenites and Assyrians; End of Balaam's story
\bibleverse{20} He looked at Amalek, and took up his parable, and said, “Amalek was the first of the nations, But his latter end shall come to destruction.” \bibleverse{21} He looked at the Kenite, and took up his parable, and said, “Your dwelling place is strong. Your nest is set in the rock. \bibleverse{22} Nevertheless Kain shall be wasted, until Asshur carries you away captive.” \bibleverse{23} He took up his parable, and said, “Alas, who shall live when God does this? \bibleverse{24} But ships shall come from the coast of Kittim. They shall afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber. He also shall come to destruction.” \bibleverse{25} Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place; and Balak also went his way. 

## Israel's debt through fornication and idolatry
# 25 
\bibleverse{1} Israel stayed in Shittim; and the people began to play the prostitute with the daughters of Moab; \bibleverse{2} for they called the people to the sacrifices of their gods. The people ate and bowed down to their gods. \bibleverse{3} Israel joined himself to Baal Peor, and the [Lord]{.smallcaps}’s anger burnt against Israel. \bibleverse{4} The [Lord]{.smallcaps} said to Moses, “Take all the chiefs of the people, and hang them up to the [Lord]{.smallcaps} before the sun, that the fierce anger of the [Lord]{.smallcaps} may turn away from Israel.” \bibleverse{5} Moses said to the judges of Israel, “Everyone kill his men who have joined themselves to Baal Peor.”

## Phinehas' intervention; his alienation from God with an everlasting priesthood
\bibleverse{6} Behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought to his brothers a Midianite woman in the sight of Moses, and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel, while they were weeping at the door of the Tent of Meeting. \bibleverse{7} When Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he rose up from the middle of the congregation, and took a spear in his hand. \bibleverse{8} He went after the man of Israel into the pavilion, and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel, and the woman through her body. So the plague was stopped amongst the children of Israel. \bibleverse{9} Those who died by the plague were twenty-four thousand. \bibleverse{10} The [Lord]{.smallcaps} spoke to Moses, saying, \bibleverse{11} “Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, has turned my wrath away from the children of Israel, in that he was jealous with my jealousy amongst them, so that I didn’t consume the children of Israel in my jealousy. \bibleverse{12} Therefore say, ‘Behold, I give to him my covenant of peace. \bibleverse{13} It shall be to him, and to his offspring after him, the covenant of an everlasting priesthood, because he was jealous for his God, and made atonement for the children of Israel.’” \bibleverse{14} Now the name of the man of Israel that was slain, who was slain with the Midianite woman, was Zimri, the son of Salu, a prince of a fathers’ house amongst the Simeonites. \bibleverse{15} The name of the Midianite woman who was slain was Cozbi, the daughter of Zur. He was head of the people of a fathers’ house in Midian.

## Gottes Gebot, an den Midianitern Rache zu nehmen
\bibleverse{16} The [Lord]{.smallcaps} spoke to Moses, saying, \bibleverse{17} “Harass the Midianites, and strike them; \bibleverse{18} for they harassed you with their wiles, wherein they have deceived you in the matter of Peor, and in the incident regarding Cozbi, the daughter of the prince of Midian, their sister, who was slain on the day of the plague in the matter of Peor.” 

## The second census of the people in the plain of the Moabites for the purpose of distributing the land
# 26 
\bibleverse{1} After the plague, the [Lord]{.smallcaps} spoke to Moses and to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying, \bibleverse{2} “Take a census of all the congregation of the children of Israel, from twenty years old and upward, by their fathers’ houses, all who are able to go out to war in Israel.” \bibleverse{3} Moses and Eleazar the priest spoke with them in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying, \bibleverse{4} “Take a census, from twenty years old and upward, as the [Lord]{.smallcaps} commanded Moses and the children of Israel.” These are those who came out of the land of Egypt.

## Census results
\bibleverse{5} Reuben, the firstborn of Israel; the sons of Reuben: of Hanoch, the family of the Hanochites; of Pallu, the family of the Palluites; \bibleverse{6} of Hezron, the family of the Hezronites; of Carmi, the family of the Carmites. \bibleverse{7} These are the families of the Reubenites; and those who were counted of them were forty-three thousand and seven hundred and thirty. \bibleverse{8} The son of Pallu: Eliab. \bibleverse{9} The sons of Eliab: Nemuel, Dathan, and Abiram. These are that Dathan and Abiram who were called by the congregation, who rebelled against Moses and against Aaron in the company of Korah when they rebelled against the [Lord]{.smallcaps}; \bibleverse{10} and the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed them up together with Korah when that company died; at the time the fire devoured two hundred and fifty men, and they became a sign. \bibleverse{11} Notwithstanding, the sons of Korah didn’t die. \bibleverse{12} The sons of Simeon after their families: of Nemuel, the family of the Nemuelites; of Jamin, the family of the Jaminites; of Jachin, the family of the Jachinites; \bibleverse{13} of Zerah, the family of the Zerahites; of Shaul, the family of the Shaulites. \bibleverse{14} These are the families of the Simeonites, twenty-two thousand and two hundred. \bibleverse{15} The sons of Gad after their families: of Zephon, the family of the Zephonites; of Haggi, the family of the Haggites; of Shuni, the family of the Shunites; \bibleverse{16} of Ozni, the family of the Oznites; of Eri, the family of the Erites; \bibleverse{17} of Arod, the family of the Arodites; of Areli, the family of the Arelites. \bibleverse{18} These are the families of the sons of Gad according to those who were counted of them, forty thousand and five hundred. \bibleverse{19} The sons of Judah: Er and Onan.

Those who were counted of them were fifty-two thousand and seven hundred. \bibleverse{35} These are the sons of Ephraim after their families: of Shuthelah, the family of the Shuthelahites; of Becher, the family of the Becherites; of Tahan, the family of the Tahanites. \bibleverse{36} These are the sons of Shuthelah: of Eran, the family of the Eranites. \bibleverse{37} These are the families of the sons of Ephraim according to those who were counted of them, thirty-two thousand and five hundred. These are the sons of Joseph after their families. \bibleverse{38} The sons of Benjamin after their families: of Bela, the family of the Belaites; of Ashbel, the family of the Ashbelites; of Ahiram, the family of the Ahiramites; \bibleverse{39} of Shephupham, the family of the Shuphamites; of Hupham, the family of the Huphamites. \bibleverse{40} The sons of Bela were Ard and Naaman: the family of the Ardites; and of Naaman, the family of the Naamites. \bibleverse{41} These are the sons of Benjamin after their families; and those who were counted of them were forty-five thousand and six hundred. \bibleverse{42} These are the sons of Dan after their families: of Shuham, the family of the Shuhamites.

## Instruction on land distribution
\bibleverse{52} The [Lord]{.smallcaps} spoke to Moses, saying, \bibleverse{53} “To these the land shall be divided for an inheritance according to the number of names. \bibleverse{54} To the more you shall give the more inheritance, and to the fewer you shall give the less inheritance. To everyone according to those who were counted of him shall his inheritance be given. \bibleverse{55} Notwithstanding, the land shall be divided by lot. According to the names of the tribes of their fathers they shall inherit. \bibleverse{56} According to the lot shall their inheritance be divided between the more and the fewer.”

## The counting of the Levites
\bibleverse{57} These are those who were counted of the Levites after their families: of Gershon, the family of the Gershonites; of Kohath, the family of the Kohathites; of Merari, the family of the Merarites. \bibleverse{58} These are the families of Levi: the family of the Libnites, the family of the Hebronites, the family of the Mahlites, the family of the Mushites, and the family of the Korahites. Kohath became the father of Amram. \bibleverse{59} The name of Amram’s wife was Jochebed, the daughter of Levi, who was born to Levi in Egypt. She bore to Amram Aaron and Moses, and Miriam their sister. \bibleverse{60} To Aaron were born Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. \bibleverse{61} Nadab and Abihu died when they offered strange fire before the [Lord]{.smallcaps}. \bibleverse{62} Those who were counted of them were twenty-three thousand, every male from a month old and upward; for they were not counted amongst the children of Israel, because there was no inheritance given them amongst the children of Israel. \bibleverse{63} These are those who were counted by Moses and Eleazar the priest, who counted the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho. \bibleverse{64} But amongst these there was not a man of them who were counted by Moses and Aaron the priest, who counted the children of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai. \bibleverse{65} For the [Lord]{.smallcaps} had said of them, “They shall surely die in the wilderness.” There was not a man left of them, except Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun. 

## Provisions relating to the property of heirs

\bibleverse{1} Then the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of Manasseh the son of Joseph came near. These are the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. \bibleverse{2} They stood before Moses, before Eleazar the priest, and before the princes and all the congregation, at the door of the Tent of Meeting, saying, \bibleverse{3} “Our father died in the wilderness. He was not amongst the company of those who gathered themselves together against the [Lord]{.smallcaps} in the company of Korah, but he died in his own sin. He had no sons. \bibleverse{4} Why should the name of our father be taken away from amongst his family, because he had no son? Give to us a possession amongst the brothers of our father.” \bibleverse{5} Moses brought their cause before the [Lord]{.smallcaps}. \bibleverse{6} The [Lord]{.smallcaps} spoke to Moses, saying, \bibleverse{7} “The daughters of Zelophehad speak right. You shall surely give them a possession of an inheritance amongst their father’s brothers. You shall cause the inheritance of their father to pass to them. \bibleverse{8} You shall speak to the children of Israel, saying, ‘If a man dies, and has no son, then you shall cause his inheritance to pass to his daughter. \bibleverse{9} If he has no daughter, then you shall give his inheritance to his brothers. \bibleverse{10} If he has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to his father’s brothers. \bibleverse{11} If his father has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to his kinsman who is next to him of his family, and he shall possess it. This shall be a statute and ordinance for the children of Israel, as the [Lord]{.smallcaps} commanded Moses.’”

## Announcement of imminent death to Moses; Installation of Joshua as his successor
\bibleverse{12} The [Lord]{.smallcaps} said to Moses, “Go up into this mountain of Abarim, and see the land which I have given to the children of Israel. \bibleverse{13} When you have seen it, you also shall be gathered to your people, as Aaron your brother was gathered; \bibleverse{14} because in the strife of the congregation, you rebelled against my word in the wilderness of Zin, to honour me as holy at the waters before their eyes.” (These are the waters of Meribah of Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.) \bibleverse{15} Moses spoke to the [Lord]{.smallcaps}, saying, \bibleverse{16} “Let the [Lord]{.smallcaps}, the God of the spirits of all flesh, appoint a man over the congregation, \bibleverse{17} who may go out before them, and who may come in before them, and who may lead them out, and who may bring them in, that the congregation of the [Lord]{.smallcaps} may not be as sheep which have no shepherd.” \bibleverse{18} The [Lord]{.smallcaps} said to Moses, “Take Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is the Spirit, and lay your hand on him. \bibleverse{19} Set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation; and commission him in their sight. \bibleverse{20} You shall give authority to him, that all the congregation of the children of Israel may obey. \bibleverse{21} He shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall enquire for him by the judgement of the Urim before the [Lord]{.smallcaps}. At his word they shall go out, and at his word they shall come in, both he and all the children of Israel with him, even all the congregation.” \bibleverse{22} Moses did as the [Lord]{.smallcaps} commanded him. He took Joshua, and set him before Eleazar the priest and before all the congregation. \bibleverse{23} He laid his hands on him and commissioned him, as the [Lord]{.smallcaps} spoke by Moses. 

## Regulations on daily and daily community slaughter

\bibleverse{1} The [Lord]{.smallcaps} spoke to Moses, saying, \bibleverse{2} “Command the children of Israel, and tell them, ‘See that you present my offering, my food for my offerings made by fire, as a pleasant aroma to me, in their due season.’

\bibleverse{39} “‘You shall offer these to the [Lord]{.smallcaps} in your set feasts—in addition to your vows and your free will offerings—for your burnt offerings, your meal offerings, your drink offerings, and your peace offerings.’” \bibleverse{40} Moses told the children of Israel according to all that the [Lord]{.smallcaps} commanded Moses. 

## Regulation on binding or nullity of votes
# 30 
\bibleverse{1} Moses spoke to the heads of the tribes of the children of Israel, saying, “This is the thing which the [Lord]{.smallcaps} has commanded. \bibleverse{2} When a man vows a vow to the [Lord]{.smallcaps}, or swears an oath to bind his soul with a bond, he shall not break his word. He shall do according to all that proceeds out of his mouth. \bibleverse{3} “Also, when a woman vows a vow to the [Lord]{.smallcaps} and binds herself by a pledge, being in her father’s house, in her youth, \bibleverse{4} and her father hears her vow and her pledge with which she has bound her soul, and her father says nothing to her, then all her vows shall stand, and every pledge with which she has bound her soul shall stand. \bibleverse{5} But if her father forbids her in the day that he hears, none of her vows or of her pledges with which she has bound her soul, shall stand. The [Lord]{.smallcaps} will forgive her, because her father has forbidden her. \bibleverse{6} “If she has a husband, while her vows are on her, or the rash utterance of her lips with which she has bound her soul, \bibleverse{7} and her husband hears it, and says nothing to her in the day that he hears it; then her vows shall stand, and her pledges with which she has bound her soul shall stand. \bibleverse{8} But if her husband forbids her in the day that he hears it, then he makes void her vow which is on her and the rash utterance of her lips, with which she has bound her soul. The [Lord]{.smallcaps} will forgive her. \bibleverse{9} “But the vow of a widow, or of her who is divorced, everything with which she has bound her soul shall stand against her. \bibleverse{10} “If she vowed in her husband’s house or bound her soul by a bond with an oath, \bibleverse{11} and her husband heard it, and held his peace at her and didn’t disallow her, then all her vows shall stand, and every pledge with which she bound her soul shall stand. \bibleverse{12} But if her husband made them null and void in the day that he heard them, then whatever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, shall not stand. Her husband has made them void. The [Lord]{.smallcaps} will forgive her. \bibleverse{13} Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband may establish it, or her husband may make it void.

## Renewed enactment of husband's rights
\bibleverse{14} But if her husband says nothing to her from day to day, then he establishes all her vows or all her pledges which are on her. He has established them, because he said nothing to her in the day that he heard them. \bibleverse{15} But if he makes them null and void after he has heard them, then he shall bear her iniquity.” \bibleverse{16} These are the statutes which the [Lord]{.smallcaps} commanded Moses, between a man and his wife, between a father and his daughter, being in her youth, in her father’s house. 

## War of revenge of the Israelites against the Midianites
# 31 
\bibleverse{1} The [Lord]{.smallcaps} spoke to Moses, saying, \bibleverse{2} “Avenge the children of Israel on the Midianites. Afterward you shall be gathered to your people.” \bibleverse{3} Moses spoke to the people, saying, “Arm men from amongst you for war, that they may go against Midian, to execute the [Lord]{.smallcaps}’s vengeance on Midian. \bibleverse{4} You shall send one thousand out of every tribe, throughout all the tribes of Israel, to the war.” \bibleverse{5} So there were delivered, out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand from every tribe, twelve thousand armed for war. \bibleverse{6} Moses sent them, one thousand of every tribe, to the war with Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, with the vessels of the sanctuary and the trumpets for the alarm in his hand. \bibleverse{7} They fought against Midian, as the [Lord]{.smallcaps} commanded Moses. They killed every male. \bibleverse{8} They killed the kings of Midian with the rest of their slain: Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba, the five kings of Midian. They also killed Balaam the son of Beor with the sword. \bibleverse{9} The children of Israel took the women of Midian captive with their little ones; and all their livestock, all their flocks, and all their goods, they took as plunder. \bibleverse{10} All their cities in the places in which they lived, and all their encampments, they burnt with fire. \bibleverse{11} They took all the captives, and all the plunder, both of man and of animal. \bibleverse{12} They brought the captives with the prey and the plunder, to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and to the congregation of the children of Israel, to the camp at the plains of Moab, which are by the Jordan at Jericho.

## Ordinance on the killing of all male children, on the treatment of female prisoners and children, and on the cleaning to be carried out before return
\bibleverse{13} Moses and Eleazar the priest, with all the princes of the congregation, went out to meet them outside of the camp. \bibleverse{14} Moses was angry with the officers of the army, the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds, who came from the service of the war. \bibleverse{15} Moses said to them, “Have you saved all the women alive? \bibleverse{16} Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against the [Lord]{.smallcaps} in the matter of Peor, and so the plague was amongst the congregation of the [Lord]{.smallcaps}. \bibleverse{17} Now therefore kill every male amongst the little ones, and kill every woman who has known man by lying with him. \bibleverse{18} But all the girls, who have not known man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves. \bibleverse{19} “Encamp outside of the camp for seven days. Whoever has killed any person, and whoever has touched any slain, purify yourselves on the third day and on the seventh day, you and your captives. \bibleverse{20} You shall purify every garment, and all that is made of skin, and all work of goats’ hair, and all things made of wood.” \bibleverse{21} Eleazar the priest said to the men of war who went to the battle, “This is the statute of the law which the [Lord]{.smallcaps} has commanded Moses. \bibleverse{22} However the gold, and the silver, the bronze, the iron, the tin, and the lead, \bibleverse{23} everything that may withstand the fire, you shall make to go through the fire, and it shall be clean; nevertheless it shall be purified with the water for impurity. All that doesn’t withstand the fire you shall make to go through the water. \bibleverse{24} You shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and you shall be clean. Afterward you shall come into the camp.”

## Distribution of live prey (humans and livestock); Leaders Christmas Gift
\bibleverse{25} The [Lord]{.smallcaps} spoke to Moses, saying, \bibleverse{26} “Count the plunder that was taken, both of man and of animal, you, and Eleazar the priest, and the heads of the fathers’ households of the congregation; \bibleverse{27} and divide the plunder into two parts: between the men skilled in war, who went out to battle, and all the congregation. \bibleverse{28} Levy a tribute to the [Lord]{.smallcaps} of the men of war who went out to battle: one soul of five hundred; of the persons, of the cattle, of the donkeys, and of the flocks. \bibleverse{29} Take it from their half, and give it to Eleazar the priest, for the [Lord]{.smallcaps}’s wave offering. \bibleverse{30} Of the children of Israel’s half, you shall take one drawn out of every fifty, of the persons, of the cattle, of the donkeys, and of the flocks, of all the livestock, and give them to the Levites, who perform the duty of the [Lord]{.smallcaps}’s tabernacle.” \bibleverse{31} Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the [Lord]{.smallcaps} commanded Moses. \bibleverse{32} Now the plunder, over and above the booty which the men of war took, was six hundred and seventy-five thousand sheep, \bibleverse{33} seventy-two thousand head of cattle, \bibleverse{34} sixty-one thousand donkeys, \bibleverse{35} and thirty-two thousand persons in all, of the women who had not known man by lying with him. \bibleverse{36} The half, which was the portion of those who went out to war, was in number three hundred and thirty-seven thousand and five hundred sheep; \bibleverse{37} and the [Lord]{.smallcaps}’s tribute of the sheep was six hundred and seventy-five. \bibleverse{38} The cattle were thirty-six thousand, of which the [Lord]{.smallcaps}’s tribute was seventy-two. \bibleverse{39} The donkeys were thirty thousand and five hundred, of which the [Lord]{.smallcaps}’s tribute was sixty-one. \bibleverse{40} The persons were sixteen thousand, of whom the [Lord]{.smallcaps}’s tribute was thirty-two persons. \bibleverse{41} Moses gave the tribute, which was the [Lord]{.smallcaps}’s wave offering, to Eleazar the priest, as the [Lord]{.smallcaps} commanded Moses. \bibleverse{42} Of the children of Israel’s half, which Moses divided off from the men who fought \bibleverse{43} (now the congregation’s half was three hundred and thirty-seven thousand and five hundred sheep, \bibleverse{44} thirty-six thousand head of cattle, \bibleverse{45} thirty thousand and five hundred donkeys, \bibleverse{46} and sixteen thousand persons), \bibleverse{47} even of the children of Israel’s half, Moses took one drawn out of every fifty, both of man and of animal, and gave them to the Levites, who performed the duty of the [Lord]{.smallcaps}’s tabernacle, as the [Lord]{.smallcaps} commanded Moses. \bibleverse{48} The officers who were over the thousands of the army, the captains of thousands, and the captains of hundreds, came near to Moses. \bibleverse{49} They said to Moses, “Your servants have taken the sum of the men of war who are under our command, and there lacks not one man of us. \bibleverse{50} We have brought the [Lord]{.smallcaps}’s offering, what every man found: gold ornaments, armlets, bracelets, signet rings, earrings, and necklaces, to make atonement for our souls before the [Lord]{.smallcaps}.” \bibleverse{51} Moses and Eleazar the priest took their gold, even all worked jewels. \bibleverse{52} All the gold of the wave offering that they offered up to the [Lord]{.smallcaps}, of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of hundreds, was sixteen thousand and seven hundred and fifty shekels.^[**31:52** A shekel is about 10 grams or about 0.35 ounces, so 16,750 shekels is about 167.5 kilograms or about 368.5 pounds.] \bibleverse{53} The men of war had taken booty, every man for himself. \bibleverse{54} Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the Tent of Meeting for a memorial for the children of Israel before the [Lord]{.smallcaps}.

## The request of the Reubenites and Gadites was rejected by Moses in a punitive speech
# 32 
\bibleverse{1} Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great multitude of livestock. They saw the land of Jazer, and the land of Gilead. Behold, the place was a place for livestock. \bibleverse{2} Then the children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spoke to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and to the princes of the congregation, saying, \bibleverse{3} “Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo, and Beon, \bibleverse{4} the land which The [Lord]{.smallcaps} struck before the congregation of Israel, is a land for livestock; and your servants have livestock.” \bibleverse{5} They said, “If we have found favour in your sight, let this land be given to your servants for a possession. Don’t bring us over the Jordan.” \bibleverse{6} Moses said to the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, “Shall your brothers go to war while you sit here? \bibleverse{7} Why do you discourage the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which the [Lord]{.smallcaps} has given them? \bibleverse{8} Your fathers did so when I sent them from Kadesh Barnea to see the land. \bibleverse{9} For when they went up to the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that they should not go into the land which the [Lord]{.smallcaps} had given them. \bibleverse{10} The [Lord]{.smallcaps}’s anger burnt in that day, and he swore, saying, \bibleverse{11} ‘Surely none of the men who came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; because they have not wholly followed me, \bibleverse{12} except Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite, and Joshua the son of Nun, because they have followed the [Lord]{.smallcaps} completely.’ \bibleverse{13} The [Lord]{.smallcaps}’s anger burnt against Israel, and he made them wander back and forth in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation who had done evil in the [Lord]{.smallcaps}’s sight was consumed. \bibleverse{14} “Behold, you have risen up in your fathers’ place, an increase of sinful men, to increase the fierce anger of the [Lord]{.smallcaps} towards Israel. \bibleverse{15} For if you turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them in the wilderness; and you will destroy all these people.”

## The response of the Reubenites and Gadites
\bibleverse{16} They came near to him, and said, “We will build sheepfolds here for our livestock, and cities for our little ones; \bibleverse{17} but we ourselves will be ready armed to go before the children of Israel, until we have brought them to their place. Our little ones shall dwell in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land. \bibleverse{18} We will not return to our houses until the children of Israel have all received their inheritance. \bibleverse{19} For we will not inherit with them on the other side of the Jordan and beyond, because our inheritance has come to us on this side of the Jordan eastward.”

## The promise of Moses, stating the conditions; Awarding the Country East of the Jordan to the Supplicating Tribes
\bibleverse{20} Moses said to them: “If you will do this thing, if you will arm yourselves to go before the [Lord]{.smallcaps} to the war, \bibleverse{21} and every one of your armed men will pass over the Jordan before the [Lord]{.smallcaps} until he has driven out his enemies from before him, \bibleverse{22} and the land is subdued before the [Lord]{.smallcaps}; then afterward you shall return, and be clear of obligation to the [Lord]{.smallcaps} and to Israel. Then this land shall be your possession before the [Lord]{.smallcaps}. \bibleverse{23} “But if you will not do so, behold, you have sinned against the [Lord]{.smallcaps}; and be sure your sin will find you out. \bibleverse{24} Build cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep; and do that which has proceeded out of your mouth.” \bibleverse{25} The children of Gad and the children of Reuben spoke to Moses, saying, “Your servants will do as my lord commands. \bibleverse{26} Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our livestock shall be there in the cities of Gilead; \bibleverse{27} but your servants will pass over, every man who is armed for war, before the [Lord]{.smallcaps} to battle, as my lord says.” \bibleverse{28} So Moses commanded concerning them to Eleazar the priest, and to Joshua the son of Nun, and to the heads of the fathers’ households of the tribes of the children of Israel. \bibleverse{29} Moses said to them, “If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben will pass with you over the Jordan, every man who is armed to battle before the [Lord]{.smallcaps}, and the land is subdued before you, then you shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession; \bibleverse{30} but if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have possessions amongst you in the land of Canaan.” \bibleverse{31} The children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, saying, “As the [Lord]{.smallcaps} has said to your servants, so will we do. \bibleverse{32} We will pass over armed before the [Lord]{.smallcaps} into the land of Canaan, and the possession of our inheritance shall remain with us beyond the Jordan.” \bibleverse{33} Moses gave to them, even to the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan; the land, according to its cities and borders, even the cities of the surrounding land.

Their pasture lands shall be for their livestock, and for their possessions, and for all their animals. \bibleverse{4} “The pasture lands of the cities, which you shall give to the Levites, shall be from the wall of the city and outward one thousand cubits^[**35:4** A cubit is the length from the tip of the middle finger to the elbow on a man’s arm, or about 18 inches or 46 centimetres.] around it. \bibleverse{5} You shall measure outside of the city for the east side two thousand cubits, and for the south side two thousand cubits, and for the west side two thousand cubits, and for the north side two thousand cubits, the city being in the middle. This shall be the pasture lands of their cities. \bibleverse{6} “The cities which you shall give to the Levites, they shall be the six cities of refuge, which you shall give for the man slayer to flee to. Besides them you shall give forty-two cities. \bibleverse{7} All the cities which you shall give to the Levites shall be forty-eight cities together with their pasture lands. \bibleverse{8} Concerning the cities which you shall give of the possession of the children of Israel, from the many you shall take many, and from the few you shall take few. Everyone according to his inheritance which he inherits shall give some of his cities to the Levites.” \bibleverse{9} The [Lord]{.smallcaps} spoke to Moses, saying, \bibleverse{10} “Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, ‘When you pass over the Jordan into the land of Canaan, \bibleverse{11} then you shall appoint for yourselves cities to be cities of refuge for you, that the man slayer who kills any person unwittingly may flee there. \bibleverse{12} The cities shall be for your refuge from the avenger, that the man slayer not die until he stands before the congregation for judgement. \bibleverse{13} The cities which you shall give shall be for you six cities of refuge. \bibleverse{14} You shall give three cities beyond the Jordan, and you shall give three cities in the land of Canaan. They shall be cities of refuge. \bibleverse{15} These six cities shall be refuge for the children of Israel, for the stranger, and for the foreigner living amongst them, that everyone who kills any person unwittingly may flee there.

## Killer's Punishment
\bibleverse{16} “‘But if he struck him with an instrument of iron, so that he died, he is a murderer. The murderer shall surely be put to death. \bibleverse{17} If he struck him with a stone in the hand, by which a man may die, and he died, he is a murderer. The murderer shall surely be put to death. \bibleverse{18} Or if he struck him with a weapon of wood in the hand, by which a man may die, and he died, he is a murderer. The murderer shall surely be put to death. \bibleverse{19} The avenger of blood shall himself put the murderer to death. When he meets him, he shall put him to death. \bibleverse{20} If he shoved him out of hatred, or hurled something at him while lying in wait, so that he died, \bibleverse{21} or in hostility struck him with his hand, so that he died, he who struck him shall surely be put to death. He is a murderer. The avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death when he meets him. \bibleverse{22} “‘But if he shoved him suddenly without hostility, or hurled on him anything without lying in wait, \bibleverse{23} or with any stone, by which a man may die, not seeing him, and cast it on him so that he died, and he was not his enemy and not seeking his harm, \bibleverse{24} then the congregation shall judge between the striker and the avenger of blood according to these ordinances. \bibleverse{25} The congregation shall deliver the man slayer out of the hand of the avenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore him to his city of refuge, where he had fled. He shall dwell therein until the death of the high priest, who was anointed with the holy oil. \bibleverse{26} “‘But if the man slayer shall at any time go beyond the border of his city of refuge where he flees, \bibleverse{27} and the avenger of blood finds him outside of the border of his city of refuge, and the avenger of blood kills the man slayer, he shall not be guilty of blood, \bibleverse{28} because he should have remained in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest. But after the death of the high priest, the man slayer shall return into the land of his possession. \bibleverse{29} “‘These things shall be for a statute and ordinance to you throughout your generations in all your dwellings. \bibleverse{30} “‘Whoever kills any person, the murderer shall be slain based on the testimony of witnesses; but one witness shall not testify alone against any person so that he dies. \bibleverse{31} “‘Moreover you shall take no ransom for the life of a murderer who is guilty of death. He shall surely be put to death. \bibleverse{32} “‘You shall take no ransom for him who has fled to his city of refuge, that he may come again to dwell in the land before the death of the priest. \bibleverse{33} “‘So you shall not pollute the land where you live; for blood pollutes the land. No atonement can be made for the land for the blood that is shed in it, but by the blood of him who shed it. \bibleverse{34} You shall not defile the land which you inhabit, where I dwell; for I, the [Lord]{.smallcaps}, dwell amongst the children of Israel.’”

# 36 
\bibleverse{1} The heads of the fathers’ households of the family of the children of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near and spoke before Moses and before the princes, the heads of the fathers’ households of the children of Israel. \bibleverse{2} They said, “The [Lord]{.smallcaps} commanded my lord to give the land for inheritance by lot to the children of Israel. My lord was commanded by the [Lord]{.smallcaps} to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother to his daughters. \bibleverse{3} If they are married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the children of Israel, then their inheritance will be taken away from the inheritance of our fathers, and will be added to the inheritance of the tribe to which they shall belong. So it will be taken away from the lot of our inheritance. \bibleverse{4} When the jubilee of the children of Israel comes, then their inheritance will be added to the inheritance of the tribe to which they shall belong. So their inheritance will be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.”

## The new generally applicable regulation on heirloom marriage
\bibleverse{5} Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the [Lord]{.smallcaps}’s word, saying, “The tribe of the sons of Joseph speak what is right. \bibleverse{6} This is the thing which the [Lord]{.smallcaps} commands concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, ‘Let them be married to whom they think best, only they shall marry into the family of the tribe of their father. \bibleverse{7} So shall no inheritance of the children of Israel move from tribe to tribe; for the children of Israel shall all keep the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers. \bibleverse{8} Every daughter who possesses an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel shall be wife to one of the family of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may each possess the inheritance of his fathers. \bibleverse{9} So shall no inheritance move from one tribe to another tribe; for the tribes of the children of Israel shall each keep his own inheritance.’” \bibleverse{10} The daughters of Zelophehad did as the [Lord]{.smallcaps} commanded Moses: \bibleverse{11} for Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married to their father’s brothers’ sons. \bibleverse{12} They were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph. Their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father. \bibleverse{13} These are the commandments and the ordinances which the [Lord]{.smallcaps} commanded by Moses to the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho.
