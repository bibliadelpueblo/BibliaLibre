\bibleverse{1} Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ,^[**1:1** “Christ” means “Anointed One”.] according to the faith of God’s chosen ones and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness, \bibleverse{2} in hope of eternal life, which God, who can’t lie, promised before time began; \bibleverse{3} but in his own time revealed his word in the message with which I was entrusted according to the commandment of God our Saviour, \bibleverse{4} to Titus, my true child according to a common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.

## Regulations Governing the Appointment of Elders as Church Leaders
\bibleverse{5} I left you in Crete for this reason, that you would set in order the things that were lacking and appoint elders in every city, as I directed you— \bibleverse{6} if anyone is blameless, the husband of one wife, having children who believe, who are not accused of loose or unruly behaviour. \bibleverse{7} For the overseer must be blameless, as God’s steward, not self-pleasing, not easily angered, not given to wine, not violent, not greedy for dishonest gain; \bibleverse{8} but given to hospitality, a lover of good, sober minded, fair, holy, self-controlled, \bibleverse{9} holding to the faithful word which is according to the teaching, that he may be able to exhort in the sound doctrine, and to convict those who contradict him.

## Rules of conduct against malicious seducers and hypocritical false teachers
\bibleverse{10} For there are also many unruly men, vain talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision, \bibleverse{11} whose mouths must be stopped: men who overthrow whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for dishonest gain’s sake. \bibleverse{12} One of them, a prophet of their own, said, “Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, and idle gluttons.” \bibleverse{13} This testimony is true. For this cause, reprove them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith, \bibleverse{14} not paying attention to Jewish fables and commandments of men who turn away from the truth. \bibleverse{15} To the pure, all things are pure, but to those who are defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure; but both their mind and their conscience are defiled. \bibleverse{16} They profess that they know God, but by their deeds they deny him, being abominable, disobedient, and unfit for any good work.

\bibleverse{1} But say the things which fit sound doctrine, \bibleverse{2} that older men should be temperate, sensible, sober minded, sound in faith, in love, and in perseverance, \bibleverse{3} and that older women likewise be reverent in behaviour, not slanderers nor enslaved to much wine, teachers of that which is good, \bibleverse{4} that they may train the young wives to love their husbands, to love their children, \bibleverse{5} to be sober minded, chaste, workers at home, kind, being in subjection to their own husbands, that God’s word may not be blasphemed. \bibleverse{6} Likewise, exhort the younger men to be sober minded. \bibleverse{7} In all things show yourself an example of good works. In your teaching, show integrity, seriousness, incorruptibility, \bibleverse{8} and soundness of speech that can’t be condemned, that he who opposes you may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say about us. \bibleverse{9} Exhort servants to be in subjection to their own masters and to be well-pleasing in all things, not contradicting, \bibleverse{10} not stealing, but showing all good fidelity, that they may adorn the doctrine of God, our Saviour, in all things.

## Justification of these regulations referring to the grace of God that appeared in the world
\bibleverse{11} For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men, \bibleverse{12} instructing us to the intent that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we would live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present age; \bibleverse{13} looking for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of our great God and Saviour, Jesus Christ, \bibleverse{14} who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify for himself a people for his own possession, zealous for good works. \bibleverse{15} Say these things and exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no one despise you. 

## On behavior against pagan authorities and non-Christians and on the path of Christians as a renewed people
# 3 
\bibleverse{1} Remind them to be in subjection to rulers and to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good work, \bibleverse{2} to speak evil of no one, not to be contentious, to be gentle, showing all humility towards all men. \bibleverse{3} For we were also once foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another. \bibleverse{4} But when the kindness of God our Saviour and his love towards mankind appeared, \bibleverse{5} not by works of righteousness which we did ourselves, but according to his mercy, he saved us through the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit, \bibleverse{6} whom he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Saviour; \bibleverse{7} that being justified by his grace, we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.

## Conclusion on behavior in the face of doctrinal aberrations and their representatives
\bibleverse{8} This saying is faithful, and concerning these things I desire that you insist confidently, so that those who have believed God may be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable to men; \bibleverse{9} but shun foolish questionings, genealogies, strife, and disputes about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain. \bibleverse{10} Avoid a factious man after a first and second warning, \bibleverse{11} knowing that such a one is perverted and sinful, being self-condemned.

## Final personal comments, last orders and greetings
\bibleverse{12} When I send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, be diligent to come to me to Nicopolis, for I have determined to winter there. \bibleverse{13} Send Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey speedily, that nothing may be lacking for them. \bibleverse{14} Let our people also learn to maintain good works to meet necessary needs, that they may not be unfruitful. \bibleverse{15} All who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.
