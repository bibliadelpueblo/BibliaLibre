[1]{#verse-2-John-1-1 .bibleverse} The elder, to the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in truth, and not I only, but also all those who know the truth, [2]{#verse-2-John-1-2 .bibleverse} for the truth’s sake, which remains in us, and it will be with us forever: [3]{#verse-2-John-1-3 .bibleverse} Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us, from God the Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ,^[**1:3** “Christ” means “Anointed One”.] the Son of the Father, in truth and love. 
[4]{#verse-2-John-1-4 .bibleverse} I rejoice greatly that I have found some of your children walking in truth, even as we have been commanded by the Father. [5]{#verse-2-John-1-5 .bibleverse} Now I beg you, dear lady, not as though I wrote to you a new commandment, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another. [6]{#verse-2-John-1-6 .bibleverse} This is love, that we should walk according to his commandments. This is the commandment, even as you heard from the beginning, that you should walk in it. 
[7]{#verse-2-John-1-7 .bibleverse} For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who don’t confess that Jesus Christ came in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the Antichrist. [8]{#verse-2-John-1-8 .bibleverse} Watch yourselves, that we don’t lose the things which we have accomplished, but that we receive a full reward. [9]{#verse-2-John-1-9 .bibleverse} Whoever transgresses and doesn’t remain in the teaching of Christ doesn’t have God. He who remains in the teaching has both the Father and the Son. [10]{#verse-2-John-1-10 .bibleverse} If anyone comes to you and doesn’t bring this teaching, don’t receive him into your house, and don’t welcome him, [11]{#verse-2-John-1-11 .bibleverse} for he who welcomes him participates in his evil deeds. 
[12]{#verse-2-John-1-12 .bibleverse} Having many things to write to you, I don’t want to do so with paper and ink, but I hope to come to you and to speak face to face, that our joy may be made full. [13]{#verse-2-John-1-13 .bibleverse} The children of your chosen sister greet you. Amen.
