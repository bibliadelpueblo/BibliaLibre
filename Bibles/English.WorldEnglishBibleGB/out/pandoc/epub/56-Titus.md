[1]{#verse-Titus-1-1 .bibleverse} Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ,^[**1:1** “Christ” means “Anointed One”.] according to the faith of God’s chosen ones and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness, [2]{#verse-Titus-1-2 .bibleverse} in hope of eternal life, which God, who can’t lie, promised before time began; [3]{#verse-Titus-1-3 .bibleverse} but in his own time revealed his word in the message with which I was entrusted according to the commandment of God our Saviour, [4]{#verse-Titus-1-4 .bibleverse} to Titus, my true child according to a common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.
[5]{#verse-Titus-1-5 .bibleverse} I left you in Crete for this reason, that you would set in order the things that were lacking and appoint elders in every city, as I directed you— [6]{#verse-Titus-1-6 .bibleverse} if anyone is blameless, the husband of one wife, having children who believe, who are not accused of loose or unruly behaviour. [7]{#verse-Titus-1-7 .bibleverse} For the overseer must be blameless, as God’s steward, not self-pleasing, not easily angered, not given to wine, not violent, not greedy for dishonest gain; [8]{#verse-Titus-1-8 .bibleverse} but given to hospitality, a lover of good, sober minded, fair, holy, self-controlled, [9]{#verse-Titus-1-9 .bibleverse} holding to the faithful word which is according to the teaching, that he may be able to exhort in the sound doctrine, and to convict those who contradict him.
[10]{#verse-Titus-1-10 .bibleverse} For there are also many unruly men, vain talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision, [11]{#verse-Titus-1-11 .bibleverse} whose mouths must be stopped: men who overthrow whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for dishonest gain’s sake. [12]{#verse-Titus-1-12 .bibleverse} One of them, a prophet of their own, said, “Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, and idle gluttons.” [13]{#verse-Titus-1-13 .bibleverse} This testimony is true. For this cause, reprove them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith, [14]{#verse-Titus-1-14 .bibleverse} not paying attention to Jewish fables and commandments of men who turn away from the truth. [15]{#verse-Titus-1-15 .bibleverse} To the pure, all things are pure, but to those who are defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure; but both their mind and their conscience are defiled. [16]{#verse-Titus-1-16 .bibleverse} They profess that they know God, but by their deeds they deny him, being abominable, disobedient, and unfit for any good work.

[1]{#verse-Titus-2-1 .bibleverse} But say the things which fit sound doctrine, [2]{#verse-Titus-2-2 .bibleverse} that older men should be temperate, sensible, sober minded, sound in faith, in love, and in perseverance, [3]{#verse-Titus-2-3 .bibleverse} and that older women likewise be reverent in behaviour, not slanderers nor enslaved to much wine, teachers of that which is good, [4]{#verse-Titus-2-4 .bibleverse} that they may train the young wives to love their husbands, to love their children, [5]{#verse-Titus-2-5 .bibleverse} to be sober minded, chaste, workers at home, kind, being in subjection to their own husbands, that God’s word may not be blasphemed. [6]{#verse-Titus-2-6 .bibleverse} Likewise, exhort the younger men to be sober minded. [7]{#verse-Titus-2-7 .bibleverse} In all things show yourself an example of good works. In your teaching, show integrity, seriousness, incorruptibility, [8]{#verse-Titus-2-8 .bibleverse} and soundness of speech that can’t be condemned, that he who opposes you may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say about us. [9]{#verse-Titus-2-9 .bibleverse} Exhort servants to be in subjection to their own masters and to be well-pleasing in all things, not contradicting, [10]{#verse-Titus-2-10 .bibleverse} not stealing, but showing all good fidelity, that they may adorn the doctrine of God, our Saviour, in all things.
[11]{#verse-Titus-2-11 .bibleverse} For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men, [12]{#verse-Titus-2-12 .bibleverse} instructing us to the intent that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we would live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present age; [13]{#verse-Titus-2-13 .bibleverse} looking for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of our great God and Saviour, Jesus Christ, [14]{#verse-Titus-2-14 .bibleverse} who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify for himself a people for his own possession, zealous for good works. [15]{#verse-Titus-2-15 .bibleverse} Say these things and exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no one despise you. 

<h2 class="chaptertitle">[&nbsp;3&nbsp;](ch056.xhtml)<span><span id="chapter-Titus-3"></span></span></h2>
 
[1]{#verse-Titus-3-1 .bibleverse} Remind them to be in subjection to rulers and to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good work, [2]{#verse-Titus-3-2 .bibleverse} to speak evil of no one, not to be contentious, to be gentle, showing all humility towards all men. [3]{#verse-Titus-3-3 .bibleverse} For we were also once foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another. [4]{#verse-Titus-3-4 .bibleverse} But when the kindness of God our Saviour and his love towards mankind appeared, [5]{#verse-Titus-3-5 .bibleverse} not by works of righteousness which we did ourselves, but according to his mercy, he saved us through the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit, [6]{#verse-Titus-3-6 .bibleverse} whom he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Saviour; [7]{#verse-Titus-3-7 .bibleverse} that being justified by his grace, we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.
[8]{#verse-Titus-3-8 .bibleverse} This saying is faithful, and concerning these things I desire that you insist confidently, so that those who have believed God may be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable to men; [9]{#verse-Titus-3-9 .bibleverse} but shun foolish questionings, genealogies, strife, and disputes about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain. [10]{#verse-Titus-3-10 .bibleverse} Avoid a factious man after a first and second warning, [11]{#verse-Titus-3-11 .bibleverse} knowing that such a one is perverted and sinful, being self-condemned.
[12]{#verse-Titus-3-12 .bibleverse} When I send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, be diligent to come to me to Nicopolis, for I have determined to winter there. [13]{#verse-Titus-3-13 .bibleverse} Send Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey speedily, that nothing may be lacking for them. [14]{#verse-Titus-3-14 .bibleverse} Let our people also learn to maintain good works to meet necessary needs, that they may not be unfruitful. [15]{#verse-Titus-3-15 .bibleverse} All who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.
