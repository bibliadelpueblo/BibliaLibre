[1]{#verse-2-Timothy-1-1 .bibleverse} Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ^[**1:1** “Christ” means “Anointed One”.] through the will of God, according to the promise of the life which is in Christ Jesus, [2]{#verse-2-Timothy-1-2 .bibleverse} to Timothy, my beloved child: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. 
[3]{#verse-2-Timothy-1-3 .bibleverse} I thank God, whom I serve as my forefathers did, with a pure conscience. How unceasing is my memory of you in my petitions, night and day [4]{#verse-2-Timothy-1-4 .bibleverse} longing to see you, remembering your tears, that I may be filled with joy; [5]{#verse-2-Timothy-1-5 .bibleverse} having been reminded of the sincere faith that is in you, which lived first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice and, I am persuaded, in you also. 
[6]{#verse-2-Timothy-1-6 .bibleverse} For this cause, I remind you that you should stir up the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands. [7]{#verse-2-Timothy-1-7 .bibleverse} For God didn’t give us a spirit of fear, but of power, love, and self-control. [8]{#verse-2-Timothy-1-8 .bibleverse} Therefore don’t be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner; but endure hardship for the Good News according to the power of God, [9]{#verse-2-Timothy-1-9 .bibleverse} who saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before times eternal, [10]{#verse-2-Timothy-1-10 .bibleverse} but has now been revealed by the appearing of our Saviour, Christ Jesus, who abolished death, and brought life and immortality to light through the Good News. [11]{#verse-2-Timothy-1-11 .bibleverse} For this I was appointed as a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles. [12]{#verse-2-Timothy-1-12 .bibleverse} For this cause I also suffer these things. 
Yet I am not ashamed, for I know him whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able to guard that which I have committed to him against that day. 
[13]{#verse-2-Timothy-1-13 .bibleverse} Hold the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. [14]{#verse-2-Timothy-1-14 .bibleverse} That good thing which was committed to you, guard through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us. 
[15]{#verse-2-Timothy-1-15 .bibleverse} This you know, that all who are in Asia turned away from me, of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes. [16]{#verse-2-Timothy-1-16 .bibleverse} May the Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain, [17]{#verse-2-Timothy-1-17 .bibleverse} but when he was in Rome, he sought me diligently and found me [18]{#verse-2-Timothy-1-18 .bibleverse} (the Lord grant to him to find the Lord’s mercy in that day); and in how many things he served at Ephesus, you know very well.

[1]{#verse-2-Timothy-2-1 .bibleverse} You therefore, my child, be strengthened in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. [2]{#verse-2-Timothy-2-2 .bibleverse} The things which you have heard from me amongst many witnesses, commit the same things to faithful men who will be able to teach others also. [3]{#verse-2-Timothy-2-3 .bibleverse} You therefore must endure hardship as a good soldier of Christ Jesus. [4]{#verse-2-Timothy-2-4 .bibleverse} No soldier on duty entangles himself in the affairs of life, that he may please him who enrolled him as a soldier. [5]{#verse-2-Timothy-2-5 .bibleverse} Also, if anyone competes in athletics, he isn’t crowned unless he has competed by the rules. [6]{#verse-2-Timothy-2-6 .bibleverse} The farmer who labours must be the first to get a share of the crops. [7]{#verse-2-Timothy-2-7 .bibleverse} Consider what I say, and may the Lord give you understanding in all things. 
[8]{#verse-2-Timothy-2-8 .bibleverse} Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, of the offspring^[**2:8** or, seed] of David, according to my Good News, [9]{#verse-2-Timothy-2-9 .bibleverse} in which I suffer hardship to the point of chains as a criminal. But God’s word isn’t chained. [10]{#verse-2-Timothy-2-10 .bibleverse} Therefore I endure all things for the chosen ones’ sake, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory. [11]{#verse-2-Timothy-2-11 .bibleverse} This saying is trustworthy: “For if we died with him, we will also live with him. [12]{#verse-2-Timothy-2-12 .bibleverse} If we endure, we will also reign with him. If we deny him, he also will deny us. [13]{#verse-2-Timothy-2-13 .bibleverse} If we are faithless, he remains faithful; for he can’t deny himself.” 
[14]{#verse-2-Timothy-2-14 .bibleverse} Remind them of these things, charging them in the sight of the Lord that they don’t argue about words to no profit, to the subverting of those who hear. 
[15]{#verse-2-Timothy-2-15 .bibleverse} Give diligence to present yourself approved by God, a workman who doesn’t need to be ashamed, properly handling the Word of Truth. [16]{#verse-2-Timothy-2-16 .bibleverse} But shun empty chatter, for it will go further in ungodliness, [17]{#verse-2-Timothy-2-17 .bibleverse} and those words will consume like gangrene, of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus: [18]{#verse-2-Timothy-2-18 .bibleverse} men who have erred concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection is already past, and overthrowing the faith of some. [19]{#verse-2-Timothy-2-19 .bibleverse} However, God’s firm foundation stands, having this seal: “The Lord knows those who are his,”^[**2:19** Numbers 16:5] and, “Let every one who names the name of the Lord^[**2:19** TR reads “Christ” instead of “the Lord”] depart from unrighteousness.” 
[20]{#verse-2-Timothy-2-20 .bibleverse} Now in a large house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of clay. Some are for honour and some for dishonour. [21]{#verse-2-Timothy-2-21 .bibleverse} If anyone therefore purges himself from these, he will be a vessel for honour, sanctified, and suitable for the master’s use, prepared for every good work. 
[22]{#verse-2-Timothy-2-22 .bibleverse} Flee from youthful lusts; but pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart. [23]{#verse-2-Timothy-2-23 .bibleverse} But refuse foolish and ignorant questionings, knowing that they generate strife. [24]{#verse-2-Timothy-2-24 .bibleverse} The Lord’s servant must not quarrel, but be gentle towards all, able to teach, patient, [25]{#verse-2-Timothy-2-25 .bibleverse} in gentleness correcting those who oppose him. Perhaps God may give them repentance leading to a full knowledge of the truth, [26]{#verse-2-Timothy-2-26 .bibleverse} and they may recover themselves out of the devil’s snare, having been taken captive by him to do his will.

[1]{#verse-2-Timothy-3-1 .bibleverse} But know this: that in the last days, grievous times will come. [2]{#verse-2-Timothy-3-2 .bibleverse} For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, [3]{#verse-2-Timothy-3-3 .bibleverse} without natural affection, unforgiving, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, not lovers of good, [4]{#verse-2-Timothy-3-4 .bibleverse} traitors, headstrong, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, [5]{#verse-2-Timothy-3-5 .bibleverse} holding a form of godliness but having denied its power. Turn away from these, also. [6]{#verse-2-Timothy-3-6 .bibleverse} For some of these are people who creep into houses and take captive gullible women loaded down with sins, led away by various lusts, [7]{#verse-2-Timothy-3-7 .bibleverse} always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. [8]{#verse-2-Timothy-3-8 .bibleverse} Even as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these also oppose the truth, men corrupted in mind, who concerning the faith are rejected. [9]{#verse-2-Timothy-3-9 .bibleverse} But they will proceed no further. For their folly will be evident to all men, as theirs also came to be. 
[10]{#verse-2-Timothy-3-10 .bibleverse} But you followed my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, patience, love, steadfastness, [11]{#verse-2-Timothy-3-11 .bibleverse} persecutions, and sufferings—those things that happened to me at Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. I endured those persecutions. The Lord delivered me out of them all. [12]{#verse-2-Timothy-3-12 .bibleverse} Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution. [13]{#verse-2-Timothy-3-13 .bibleverse} But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived. [14]{#verse-2-Timothy-3-14 .bibleverse} But you remain in the things which you have learnt and have been assured of, knowing from whom you have learnt them. [15]{#verse-2-Timothy-3-15 .bibleverse} From infancy, you have known the holy Scriptures which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. [16]{#verse-2-Timothy-3-16 .bibleverse} Every Scripture is God-breathed and^[**3:16** or, Every writing inspired by God is] profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction in righteousness, [17]{#verse-2-Timothy-3-17 .bibleverse} that each person who belongs to God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work.

<h2 class="chaptertitle">[&nbsp;4&nbsp;](ch055.xhtml)<span><span id="chapter-2-Timothy-4"></span></span></h2>
 
[1]{#verse-2-Timothy-4-1 .bibleverse} I command you therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who will judge the living and the dead at his appearing and his Kingdom: [2]{#verse-2-Timothy-4-2 .bibleverse} preach the word; be urgent in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and exhort with all patience and teaching. [3]{#verse-2-Timothy-4-3 .bibleverse} For the time will come when they will not listen to the sound doctrine, but having itching ears, will heap up for themselves teachers after their own lusts, [4]{#verse-2-Timothy-4-4 .bibleverse} and will turn away their ears from the truth, and turn away to fables. [5]{#verse-2-Timothy-4-5 .bibleverse} But you be sober in all things, suffer hardship, do the work of an evangelist, and fulfil your ministry. 
[6]{#verse-2-Timothy-4-6 .bibleverse} For I am already being offered, and the time of my departure has come. [7]{#verse-2-Timothy-4-7 .bibleverse} I have fought the good fight. I have finished the course. I have kept the faith. [8]{#verse-2-Timothy-4-8 .bibleverse} From now on, the crown of righteousness is stored up for me, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give to me on that day; and not to me only, but also to all those who have loved his appearing. 
[9]{#verse-2-Timothy-4-9 .bibleverse} Be diligent to come to me soon, [10]{#verse-2-Timothy-4-10 .bibleverse} for Demas left me, having loved this present world, and went to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia; and Titus to Dalmatia. [11]{#verse-2-Timothy-4-11 .bibleverse} Only Luke is with me. Take Mark and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for service. [12]{#verse-2-Timothy-4-12 .bibleverse} But I sent Tychicus to Ephesus. [13]{#verse-2-Timothy-4-13 .bibleverse} Bring the cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus when you come—and the books, especially the parchments. [14]{#verse-2-Timothy-4-14 .bibleverse} Alexander the coppersmith did much evil to me. The Lord will repay him according to his deeds. [15]{#verse-2-Timothy-4-15 .bibleverse} Beware of him, for he greatly opposed our words. 
[16]{#verse-2-Timothy-4-16 .bibleverse} At my first defence, no one came to help me, but all left me. May it not be held against them. [17]{#verse-2-Timothy-4-17 .bibleverse} But the Lord stood by me and strengthened me, that through me the message might be fully proclaimed, and that all the Gentiles might hear. So I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion. [18]{#verse-2-Timothy-4-18 .bibleverse} And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work and will preserve me for his heavenly Kingdom. To him be the glory forever and ever. Amen. 
[19]{#verse-2-Timothy-4-19 .bibleverse} Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus. [20]{#verse-2-Timothy-4-20 .bibleverse} Erastus remained at Corinth, but I left Trophimus at Miletus sick. [21]{#verse-2-Timothy-4-21 .bibleverse} Be diligent to come before winter. Eubulus salutes you, as do Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers. 
[22]{#verse-2-Timothy-4-22 .bibleverse} The Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Grace be with you. Amen.
