the tabernacle and all its furnishings; and they shall take care of it,
and shall encamp around it. <span class="bibleverse">51</span> When the

bore it on a staff between two. They also brought some of the

class="bibleverse">4</span> Why have you brought the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s assembly into this wilderness, that we
should die there, we and our animals? <span class="bibleverse">5</span>
Why have you made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us in to this
evil place? It is no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of
pomegranates; neither is there any water to drink.” <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> Moses and Aaron went from the presence of
the assembly to the door of the Tent of Meeting, and fell on their
faces. The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s glory appeared to them.
<span class="bibleverse">7</span> The <span

congregation, you, and Aaron your brother, and speak to the rock before
their eyes, that it pour out its water. You shall bring water to them
out of the rock; so you shall give the congregation and their livestock
drink.” <span class="bibleverse">9</span> Moses took the rod from before
the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, as he commanded him. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly
together before the rock, and he said to them, “Hear now, you rebels!
Shall we bring water out of this rock for you?” <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> Moses lifted up his hand, and struck the
rock with his rod twice, and water came out abundantly. The congregation
and their livestock drank. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> said to Moses and Aaron, “Because you
didn’t believe in me, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of
Israel, therefore you shall not bring this assembly into the land which
I have given them.” <span class="bibleverse">13</span> These are the
waters of Meribah;<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"

travail that has happened to us; <span class="bibleverse">15</span> how
our fathers went down into Egypt, and we lived in Egypt a long time. The
Egyptians mistreated us and our fathers. <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> When we cried to the <span

brought us out of Egypt. Behold, we are in Kadesh, a city in the edge of
your border. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> “Please let us pass
through your land. We will not pass through field or through vineyard,
neither will we drink from the water of the wells. We will go along the
king’s highway. We will not turn away to the right hand nor to the left,
until we have passed your border.” <span class="bibleverse">18</span>
Edom said to him, “You shall not pass through me, lest I come out with
the sword against you.” <span class="bibleverse">19</span> The children
of Israel said to him, “We will go up by the highway; and if we drink
your water, I and my livestock, then I will give its price. Only let me,
without doing anything else, pass through on my feet.” <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> He said, “You shall not pass through.” Edom
came out against him with many people, and with a strong hand. <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage
through his border, so Israel turned away from him.</p>

the border of the land of Edom, saying, <span

he shall not enter into the land which I have given to the children of
Israel, because you rebelled against my word at the waters of Meribah.
<span class="bibleverse">25</span> Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and
bring them up to Mount Hor; <span class="bibleverse">26</span> and strip
Aaron of his garments, and put them on Eleazar his son. Aaron shall be

did as the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> commanded. They went up
onto Mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation. <span
class="bibleverse">28</span> Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and
put them on Eleazar his son. Aaron died there on the top of the

Moses: “Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the

loathes this disgusting food!” <span class="bibleverse">6</span> The

sinned, because we have spoken against the <span

Moses prayed for the people. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> The <span

set it on a pole. It shall happen that everyone who is bitten, when he
sees it, shall live.” <span class="bibleverse">9</span> Moses made a

from Oboth, and encamped at Iyeabarim, in the wilderness which is before
Moab, towards the sunrise. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> From there
they travelled, and encamped in the valley of Zered. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> From there they travelled, and encamped on
the other side of the Arnon, which is in the wilderness that comes out
of the border of the Amorites; for the Arnon is the border of Moab,
between Moab and the Amorites. <span class="bibleverse">14</span>
Therefore it is said in The Book of the Wars of the <span

incline towards the dwelling of Ar, leans on the border of Moab.” <span

the well of which the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> said to Moses,
“Gather the people together, and I will give them water.” <span

well! Sing to it, <span class="bibleverse">18</span> the well, which the
princes dug, which the nobles of the people dug, with the sceptre, and

through his border, but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went
out against Israel into the wilderness, and came to Jahaz. He fought
against Israel. <span class="bibleverse">24</span> Israel struck him
with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from the Arnon to the
Jabbok, even to the children of Ammon; for the border of the children of
Ammon was fortified. <span class="bibleverse">25</span> Israel took all
these cities. Israel lived in all the cities of the Amorites, in
Heshbon, and in all its villages. <span class="bibleverse">26</span> For
Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought
against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand,
even to the Arnon. <span class="bibleverse">27</span> Therefore those
who speak in proverbs say, “Come to Heshbon. Let the city of Sihon be

<span class="bibleverse">13</span> Balaam rose up in the morning, and
said to the princes of Balak, “Go to your land; for the <span

<span class="bibleverse">14</span> The princes of Moab rose up, and they
went to Balak, and said, “Balaam refuses to come with us.” <span

and his two servants were with him. <span class="bibleverse">23</span>
The donkey saw the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s angel standing
in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand; and the donkey turned out
of the path, and went into the field. Balaam struck the donkey, to turn
her into the path. <span class="bibleverse">24</span> Then the <span

vineyards, a wall being on this side, and a wall on that side. <span

narrow place, where there was no way to turn either to the right hand or

Balaam’s anger burnt, and he struck the donkey with his staff. <span

opened the mouth of the donkey, and she said to Balaam, “What have I
done to you, that you have struck me these three times?” <span

“No.” <span class="bibleverse">31</span> Then the <span

me these three times. Unless she had turned away from me, surely now I

<span class="bibleverse">13</span> The <span
