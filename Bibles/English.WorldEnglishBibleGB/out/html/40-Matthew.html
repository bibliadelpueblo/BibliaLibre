<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> The book of the genealogy of Jesus
Christ,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> the son of David, the son of
Abraham. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> Abraham became the father of
Isaac. Isaac became the father of Jacob. Jacob became the father of
Judah and his brothers. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> Judah became
the father of Perez and Zerah by Tamar. Perez became the father of
Hezron. Hezron became the father of Ram. <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> Ram became the father of Amminadab.
Amminadab became the father of Nahshon. Nahshon became the father of
Salmon. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> Salmon became the father of
Boaz by Rahab. Boaz became the father of Obed by Ruth. Obed became the
father of Jesse. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> Jesse became the
father of King David. David became the father of Solomon by her who had
been Uriah’s wife. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> Solomon became the
father of Rehoboam. Rehoboam became the father of Abijah. Abijah became
the father of Asa. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> Asa became the
father of Jehoshaphat. Jehoshaphat became the father of Joram. Joram
became the father of Uzziah. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> Uzziah
became the father of Jotham. Jotham became the father of Ahaz. Ahaz
became the father of Hezekiah. <span class="bibleverse">10</span>
Hezekiah became the father of Manasseh. Manasseh became the father of
Amon. Amon became the father of Josiah. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> Josiah became the father of Jechoniah and
his brothers at the time of the exile to Babylon. <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> After the exile to Babylon, Jechoniah
became the father of Shealtiel. Shealtiel became the father of
Zerubbabel. <span class="bibleverse">13</span> Zerubbabel became the
father of Abiud. Abiud became the father of Eliakim. Eliakim became the
father of Azor. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> Azor became the
father of Zadok. Zadok became the father of Achim. Achim became the
father of Eliud. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> Eliud became the
father of Eleazar. Eleazar became the father of Matthan. Matthan became
the father of Jacob. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> Jacob became the
father of Joseph, the husband of Mary, from whom was born Jesus,<a
href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> who is called Christ. <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> So all the generations from Abraham to
David are fourteen generations; from David to the exile to Babylon
fourteen generations; and from the carrying away to Babylon to the
Christ, fourteen generations.</p>
<h2 id="birth-and-name-of-jesus">Birth and name of Jesus</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">18</span> Now the birth of Jesus Christ was
like this: After his mother, Mary, was engaged to Joseph, before they
came together, she was found pregnant by the Holy Spirit. <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> Joseph, her husband, being a righteous man,
and not willing to make her a public example, intended to put her away
secretly. <span class="bibleverse">20</span> But when he thought about
these things, behold,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> an angel of the Lord appeared to him
in a dream, saying, “Joseph, son of David, don’t be afraid to take to
yourself Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the
Holy Spirit. <span class="bibleverse">21</span> She shall give birth to
a son. You shall name him Jesus,<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> for it is he who shall
save his people from their sins.” <span class="bibleverse">22</span> Now
all this has happened that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the
Lord through the prophet, saying, <span class="bibleverse">23</span>
“Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and shall give birth to a son.
They shall call his name Immanuel,” which is, being interpreted, “God
with us.”<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> <span class="bibleverse">24</span>
Joseph arose from his sleep, and did as the angel of the Lord commanded
him, and took his wife to himself; <span class="bibleverse">25</span>
and didn’t know her sexually until she had given birth to her firstborn
son. He named him Jesus.</p>

wise men from the east come to the baby Jesus and pay homage to him</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Now when Jesus was born in
Bethlehem of Judea in the days of King Herod, behold, wise men<a
href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> from the east came to Jerusalem,
saying, <span class="bibleverse">2</span> “Where is he who is born King
of the Jews? For we saw his star in the east, and have come to worship
him.” <span class="bibleverse">3</span> When King Herod heard it, he was
troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. <span class="bibleverse">4</span>
Gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he
asked them where the Christ would be born. <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> They said to him, “In Bethlehem of Judea,
for this is written through the prophet, <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> ‘You Bethlehem, land of Judah, are in no way
least amongst the princes of Judah; for out of you shall come a governor
who shall shepherd my people, Israel.’”<a href="#fn7"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>
<span class="bibleverse">7</span> Then Herod secretly called the wise
men, and learnt from them exactly what time the star appeared. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> He sent them to Bethlehem, and said, “Go and
search diligently for the young child. When you have found him, bring me
word, so that I also may come and worship him.” <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> They, having heard the king, went their way;
and behold, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them until
it came and stood over where the young child was. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> When they saw the star, they rejoiced with
exceedingly great joy. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> They came into
the house and saw the young child with Mary, his mother, and they fell
down and worshipped him. Opening their treasures, they offered to him
gifts: gold, frankincense, and myrrh. <span class="bibleverse">12</span>
Being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they went back to their
own country another way.</p>
<h2 id="josephs-flight-into-egypt">Joseph's Flight into Egypt</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">13</span> Now when they had departed,
behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying,
“Arise and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and
stay there until I tell you, for Herod will seek the young child to
destroy him.” <span class="bibleverse">14</span> He arose and took the
young child and his mother by night and departed into Egypt, <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> and was there until the death of Herod,
that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the
prophet, saying, “Out of Egypt I called my son.”<a href="#fn8"

<h2 id="the-murder-of-herods-child-in-bethlehem">The murder of Herod's
child in Bethlehem</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">16</span> Then Herod, when he saw that he
was mocked by the wise men, was exceedingly angry, and sent out and
killed all the male children who were in Bethlehem and in all the
surrounding countryside, from two years old and under, according to the
exact time which he had learnt from the wise men. <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> Then that which was spoken by Jeremiah the
prophet was fulfilled, saying, <span class="bibleverse">18</span> “A
voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, weeping and great mourning,
Rachel weeping for her children; she wouldn’t be comforted, because they
are no more.”<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"

<h2

return of Joseph from Egypt and his settlement in Nazareth</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">19</span> But when Herod was dead, behold,
an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, saying,
<span class="bibleverse">20</span> “Arise and take the young child and
his mother, and go into the land of Israel, for those who sought the
young child’s life are dead.” <span class="bibleverse">21</span> He
arose and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of
Israel. <span class="bibleverse">22</span> But when he heard that
Archelaus was reigning over Judea in the place of his father, Herod, he
was afraid to go there. Being warned in a dream, he withdrew into the
region of Galilee, <span class="bibleverse">23</span> and came and lived
in a city called Nazareth; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken
through the prophets that he will be called a Nazarene.</p>

<h2
id="apparition-and-penitential-sermon-of-john-the-baptist">Apparition
and penitential sermon of John the Baptist</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> In those days, John the Baptiser
came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea, saying, <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> “Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at
hand!” <span class="bibleverse">3</span> For this is he who was spoken
of by Isaiah the prophet, saying, “The voice of one crying in the
wilderness, make the way of the Lord ready! Make his paths straight!”<a
href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> <span class="bibleverse">4</span>
Now John himself wore clothing made of camel’s hair with a leather belt
around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey. <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> Then people from Jerusalem, all of Judea,
and all the region around the Jordan went out to him. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> They were baptised by him in the Jordan,
confessing their sins. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> But when he saw
many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for his baptism, he said to
them, “You offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to
come? <span class="bibleverse">8</span> Therefore produce fruit worthy
of repentance! <span class="bibleverse">9</span> Don’t think to
yourselves, ‘We have Abraham for our father,’ for I tell you that God is
able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> Even now the axe lies at the root of the
trees. Therefore every tree that doesn’t produce good fruit is cut down,
and cast into the fire. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> “I indeed
baptise you in water for repentance, but he who comes after me is
mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptise
you in the Holy Spirit.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"

<h2 id="baptism-and-consecration-of-the-messiah-of-jesus">Baptism and
consecration of the Messiah of Jesus</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">13</span> Then Jesus came from Galilee to
the Jordan<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> to John, to be baptised by him.
<span class="bibleverse">14</span> But John would have hindered him,
saying, “I need to be baptised by you, and you come to me?” <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> But Jesus, answering, said to him, “Allow
it now, for this is the fitting way for us to fulfil all righteousness.”
Then he allowed him. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> Jesus, when he
was baptised, went up directly from the water: and behold, the heavens
were opened to him. He saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and
coming on him. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> Behold, a voice out of
the heavens said, “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well
pleased.”</p>

<h2 id="the-temptation-of-jesus-as-proof-of-messiah">The temptation of
Jesus as proof of Messiah</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit
into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> When he had fasted forty days and forty
nights, he was hungry afterward. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> The
tempter came and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, command that
these stones become bread.” <span class="bibleverse">4</span> But he
answered, “It is written, ‘Man shall not live by bread alone, but by
every word that proceeds out of God’s mouth.’”<a href="#fn13"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a>
<span class="bibleverse">5</span> Then the devil took him into the holy
city. He set him on the pinnacle of the temple, <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> and said to him, “If you are the Son of God,
throw yourself down, for it is written, ‘He will command his angels
concerning you,’ and, ‘On their hands they will bear you up, so that you
don’t dash your foot against a stone.’”<a href="#fn14"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>
<span class="bibleverse">7</span> Jesus said to him, “Again, it is
written, ‘You shall not test the Lord, your God.’”<a href="#fn15"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a>
<span class="bibleverse">8</span> Again, the devil took him to an
exceedingly high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world
and their glory. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> He said to him, “I
will give you all of these things, if you will fall down and worship
me.” <span class="bibleverse">10</span> Then Jesus said to him, “Get
behind me,<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"

shall worship the Lord your God, and you shall serve him only.’” <a

Then the devil left him, and behold, angels came and served him.</p>
<h2 id="jesus-assumes-teaching-in-capernaum">Jesus assumes teaching in
Capernaum</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">12</span> Now when Jesus heard that John was
delivered up, he withdrew into Galilee. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> Leaving Nazareth, he came and lived in
Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali,
<span class="bibleverse">14</span> that it might be fulfilled which was
spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying, <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> “The land of Zebulun and the land of
Naphtali, towards the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles,
<span class="bibleverse">16</span> the people who sat in darkness saw a

light has dawned.”<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> <span class="bibleverse">17</span>

<p><span class="bibleverse">18</span> Walking by the sea of Galilee,
he<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"

called Peter, and Andrew, his brother, casting a net into the sea; for
they were fishermen. <span class="bibleverse">19</span> He said to them,
“Come after me, and I will make you fishers for men.” <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> They immediately left their nets and
followed him. <span class="bibleverse">21</span> Going on from there, he
saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother,
in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets. He called
them. <span class="bibleverse">22</span> They immediately left the boat
and their father, and followed him.</p>

class="bibleverse">24</span> The report about him went out into all
Syria. They brought to him all who were sick, afflicted with various
diseases and torments, possessed with demons, epileptics, and
paralytics; and he healed them. <span class="bibleverse">25</span> Great

the good, and sends rain on the just and the unjust. <span

neither do they spin, <span class="bibleverse">29</span> yet I tell you
that even Solomon in all his glory was not dressed like one of these.
<span class="bibleverse">30</span> But if God so clothes the grass of
the field, which today exists and tomorrow is thrown into the oven,
won’t he much more clothe you, you of little faith? <span

he went and sold all that he had and bought it. <span

dragnet that was cast into the sea and gathered some fish of every kind,
<span class="bibleverse">48</span> which, when it was filled, fishermen
drew up on the beach. They sat down and gathered the good into

all these things?” They answered him, “Yes, Lord.” <span

<p><span class="bibleverse">53</span> When Jesus had finished these
parables, he departed from there. <span class="bibleverse">54</span>
Coming into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, so that
they were astonished and said, “Where did this man get this wisdom and
these mighty works? <span class="bibleverse">55</span> Isn’t this the
carpenter’s son? Isn’t his mother called Mary, and his brothers James,
Joses, Simon, and Judas?<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref"

to them, “A prophet is not without honour, except in his own country and
in his own house.” <span class="bibleverse">58</span> He didn’t do many
mighty works there because of their unbelief.</p>

<h2 id="jesus-and-herod-the-end-of-john-the-baptist">Jesus and Herod;

<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> At that time, Herod the tetrarch
heard the report concerning Jesus, <span class="bibleverse">2</span> and
said to his servants, “This is John the Baptiser. He is risen from the
dead. That is why these powers work in him.” <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> For Herod had arrested John, bound him, and
put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife.
<span class="bibleverse">4</span> For John said to him, “It is not
lawful for you to have her.” <span class="bibleverse">5</span> When he
would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they
counted him as a prophet. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> But when
Herod’s birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced amongst them and
pleased Herod. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> Therefore he promised
with an oath to give her whatever she should ask. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> She, being prompted by her mother, said,
“Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptiser.” <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> The king was grieved, but for the sake of
his oaths and of those who sat at the table with him, he commanded it to
be given, <span class="bibleverse">10</span> and he sent and beheaded
John in the prison. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> His head was
brought on a platter and given to the young lady; and she brought it to
her mother. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> His disciples came, took
the body, and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus.</p>
<h2 id="feeding-the-five-thousand">Feeding the Five Thousand</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">13</span> Now when Jesus heard this, he
withdrew from there in a boat to a deserted place apart. When the
multitudes heard it, they followed him on foot from the cities. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> Jesus went out, and he saw a great
multitude. He had compassion on them and healed their sick. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> When evening had come, his disciples came
to him, saying, “This place is deserted, and the hour is already late.
Send the multitudes away, that they may go into the villages, and buy
themselves food.” <span class="bibleverse">16</span> But Jesus said to
them, “They don’t need to go away. You give them something to eat.”
<span class="bibleverse">17</span> They told him, “We only have here
five loaves and two fish.” <span class="bibleverse">18</span> He said,
“Bring them here to me.” <span class="bibleverse">19</span> He commanded
the multitudes to sit down on the grass; and he took the five loaves and
the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, broke and gave the
loaves to the disciples; and the disciples gave to the multitudes. <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> They all ate and were filled. They took up
twelve baskets full of that which remained left over from the broken
pieces. <span class="bibleverse">21</span> Those who ate were about five

<p><span class="bibleverse">22</span> Immediately Jesus made the
disciples get into the boat and go ahead of him to the other side, while
he sent the multitudes away. <span class="bibleverse">23</span> After he
had sent the multitudes away, he went up into the mountain by himself to
pray. When evening had come, he was there alone. <span
class="bibleverse">24</span> But the boat was now in the middle of the
sea, distressed by the waves, for the wind was contrary. <span
class="bibleverse">25</span> In the fourth watch of the night,<a

When the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled,
saying, “It’s a ghost!” and they cried out for fear. <span

saying, “Cheer up! It is I! <a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref"

<span class="bibleverse">28</span> Peter answered him and said, “Lord,

class="bibleverse">29</span> He said, “Come!” Peter stepped down from
the boat and walked on the waters to come to Jesus. <span
class="bibleverse">30</span> But when he saw that the wind was strong,
he was afraid, and beginning to sink, he cried out, saying, “Lord, save
me!” <span class="bibleverse">31</span> Immediately Jesus stretched out
his hand, took hold of him, and said to him, “You of little faith, why
did you doubt?” <span class="bibleverse">32</span> When they got up into
the boat, the wind ceased. <span class="bibleverse">33</span> Those who
were in the boat came and worshipped him, saying, “You are truly the Son

<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Then Pharisees and scribes came to
Jesus from Jerusalem, saying, <span class="bibleverse">2</span> “Why do
your disciples disobey the tradition of the elders? For they don’t wash
their hands when they eat bread.” <span class="bibleverse">3</span> He
answered them, “Why do you also disobey the commandment of God because
of your tradition? <span class="bibleverse">4</span> For God commanded,
‘Honour your father and your mother,’<a href="#fn78"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78" role="doc-noteref"><sup>78</sup></a>
and, ‘He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him be put to

But you say, ‘Whoever may tell his father or his mother, “Whatever help
you might otherwise have gotten from me is a gift devoted to God,” <span

You have made the commandment of God void because of your tradition.
<span class="bibleverse">7</span> You hypocrites! Well did Isaiah
prophesy of you, saying, <span class="bibleverse">8</span> ‘These people
draw near to me with their mouth, and honour me with their lips; but
their heart is far from me. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> And they

href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>80</sup></a> <span class="bibleverse">10</span>
He summoned the multitude, and said to them, “Hear, and understand.
<span class="bibleverse">11</span> That which enters into the mouth
doesn’t defile the man; but that which proceeds out of the mouth, this
defiles the man.” <span class="bibleverse">12</span> Then the disciples
came and said to him, “Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when
they heard this saying?” <span class="bibleverse">13</span> But he
answered, “Every plant which my heavenly Father didn’t plant will be
uprooted. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> Leave them alone. They are
blind guides of the blind. If the blind guide the blind, both will fall
into a pit.” <span class="bibleverse">15</span> Peter answered him,
“Explain the parable to us.” <span class="bibleverse">16</span> So Jesus
said, “Do you also still not understand? <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> Don’t you understand that whatever goes
into the mouth passes into the belly and then out of the body? <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> But the things which proceed out of the
mouth come out of the heart, and they defile the man. <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> For out of the heart come evil thoughts,
murders, adulteries, sexual sins, thefts, false testimony, and
blasphemies. <span class="bibleverse">20</span> These are the things
which defile the man; but to eat with unwashed hands doesn’t defile the
man.”</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">21</span> Jesus went out from there and
withdrew into the region of Tyre and Sidon. <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> Behold, a Canaanite woman came out from
those borders and cried, saying, “Have mercy on me, Lord, you son of
David! My daughter is severely possessed by a demon!” <span
class="bibleverse">23</span> But he answered her not a word. His
disciples came and begged him, saying, “Send her away; for she cries
after us.” <span class="bibleverse">24</span> But he answered, “I wasn’t
sent to anyone but the lost sheep of the house of Israel.” <span
class="bibleverse">25</span> But she came and worshipped him, saying,
“Lord, help me.” <span class="bibleverse">26</span> But he answered, “It
is not appropriate to take the children’s bread and throw it to the
dogs.” <span class="bibleverse">27</span> But she said, “Yes, Lord, but
even the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table.”
<span class="bibleverse">28</span> Then Jesus answered her, “Woman,
great is your faith! Be it done to you even as you desire.” And her

there. <span class="bibleverse">30</span> Great multitudes came to him,
having with them the lame, blind, mute, maimed, and many others, and
they put them down at his feet. He healed them, <span
class="bibleverse">31</span> so that the multitude wondered when they
saw the mute speaking, the injured healed, the lame walking, and the
blind seeing—and they glorified the God of Israel. <span
class="bibleverse">32</span> Jesus summoned his disciples and said, “I
have compassion on the multitude, because they have continued with me
now three days and have nothing to eat. I don’t want to send them away
fasting, or they might faint on the way.” <span
class="bibleverse">33</span> The disciples said to him, “Where could we
get so many loaves in a deserted place as to satisfy so great a
multitude?” <span class="bibleverse">34</span> Jesus said to them, “How
many loaves do you have?” They said, “Seven, and a few small fish.”
<span class="bibleverse">35</span> He commanded the multitude to sit
down on the ground; <span class="bibleverse">36</span> and he took the
seven loaves and the fish. He gave thanks and broke them, and gave to
the disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes. <span
class="bibleverse">37</span> They all ate and were filled. They took up
seven baskets full of the broken pieces that were left over. <span
class="bibleverse">38</span> Those who ate were four thousand men, in

generation seeks after a sign, and there will be no sign given to it,
except the sign of the prophet Jonah.” He left them and departed. <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> The disciples came to the other side and had
forgotten to take bread. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> Jesus said to
them, “Take heed and beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and
Sadducees.” <span class="bibleverse">7</span> They reasoned amongst
themselves, saying, “We brought no bread.” <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> Jesus, perceiving it, said, “Why do you
reason amongst yourselves, you of little faith, because you have brought
no bread? <span class="bibleverse">9</span> Don’t you yet perceive or
remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets you
took up, <span class="bibleverse">10</span> or the seven loaves for the
four thousand, and how many baskets you took up? <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> How is it that you don’t perceive that I
didn’t speak to you concerning bread? But beware of the yeast of the

one of the prophets.” <span class="bibleverse">15</span> He said to
them, “But who do you say that I am?” <span class="bibleverse">16</span>
Simon Peter answered, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.”
<span class="bibleverse">17</span> Jesus answered him, “Blessed are you,
Simon Bar Jonah, for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but
my Father who is in heaven. <span class="bibleverse">18</span> I also
tell you that you are Peter,<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref"

<h2 id="first-announcement-of-suffering">First announcement of

<p><span class="bibleverse">21</span> From that time, Jesus began to

him aside and began to rebuke him, saying, “Far be it from you, Lord!
This will never be done to you.” <span class="bibleverse">23</span> But

mountain by themselves. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> He was
changed<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84"

<span class="bibleverse">5</span> While he was still speaking, behold, a
bright cloud overshadowed them. Behold, a voice came out of the cloud,
saying, “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Listen to

they fell on their faces, and were very afraid. <span

Elijah must come first?” <span class="bibleverse">11</span> Jesus
answered them, “Elijah indeed comes first, and will restore all things;
<span class="bibleverse">12</span> but I tell you that Elijah has come
already, and they didn’t recognise him, but did to him whatever they
wanted to. Even so the Son of Man will also suffer by them.” <span

Bring him here to me.” <span class="bibleverse">18</span> Jesus rebuked
the demon, and it went out of him, and the boy was cured from that hour.
<span class="bibleverse">19</span> Then the disciples came to Jesus
privately, and said, “Why weren’t we able to cast it out?” <span

seed, you will tell this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it

another to his merchandise; <span class="bibleverse">6</span> and the
rest grabbed his servants, treated them shamefully, and killed them.
<span class="bibleverse">7</span> When the king heard that, he was
angry, and sent his armies, destroyed those murderers, and burnt their
city. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> “Then he said to his servants,
‘The wedding is ready, but those who were invited weren’t worthy. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> Go therefore to the intersections of the
highways, and as many as you may find, invite to the wedding feast.’
<span class="bibleverse">10</span> Those servants went out into the
highways and gathered together as many as they found, both bad and good.
The wedding was filled with guests. <span class="bibleverse">11</span>
“But when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man who
didn’t have on wedding clothing, <span class="bibleverse">12</span> and
he said to him, ‘Friend, how did you come in here not wearing wedding
clothing?’ He was speechless. <span class="bibleverse">13</span> Then
the king said to the servants, ‘Bind him hand and foot, take him away,
and throw him into the outer darkness. That is where the weeping and
grinding of teeth will be.’ <span class="bibleverse">14</span> For many
are called, but few chosen.”</p>
<h2 id="the-tax-issue-of-the-pharisees">The tax issue of the

<p><span class="bibleverse">15</span> Then the Pharisees went and took
counsel how they might entrap him in his talk. <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> They sent their disciples to him, along
with the Herodians, saying, “Teacher, we know that you are honest, and
teach the way of God in truth, no matter whom you teach; for you aren’t
partial to anyone. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> Tell us therefore,
what do you think? Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?” <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and
said, “Why do you test me, you hypocrites? <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> Show me the tax money.” They brought to him
a denarius. <span class="bibleverse">20</span> He asked them, “Whose is
this image and inscription?” <span class="bibleverse">21</span> They
said to him, “Caesar’s.” Then he said to them, “Give therefore to Caesar
the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.”
<span class="bibleverse">22</span> When they heard it, they marvelled,
and left him and went away.</p>
<h2 id="on-the-resurrection-of-the-dead">On the resurrection of the

<p><span class="bibleverse">23</span> On that day Sadducees (those who
say that there is no resurrection) came to him. They asked him, <span
class="bibleverse">24</span> saying, “Teacher, Moses said, ‘If a man
dies, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife and raise up
offspring<a href="#fn111" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref111"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>111</sup></a> for his brother.’ <span
class="bibleverse">25</span> Now there were with us seven brothers. The
first married and died, and having no offspring left his wife to his
brother. <span class="bibleverse">26</span> In the same way, the second
also, and the third, to the seventh. <span class="bibleverse">27</span>
After them all, the woman died. <span class="bibleverse">28</span> In
the resurrection therefore, whose wife will she be of the seven? For
they all had her.” <span class="bibleverse">29</span> But Jesus answered
them, “You are mistaken, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of
God. <span class="bibleverse">30</span> For in the resurrection they
neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like God’s angels in
heaven. <span class="bibleverse">31</span> But concerning the
resurrection of the dead, haven’t you read that which was spoken to you
by God, saying, <span class="bibleverse">32</span> ‘I am the God of
Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?’<a href="#fn112"

God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.” <span

question, testing him. <span class="bibleverse">36</span> “Teacher,
which is the greatest commandment in the law?” <span
class="bibleverse">37</span> Jesus said to him, “‘You shall love the
Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your
mind.’<a href="#fn113" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref113"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>113</sup></a> <span class="bibleverse">38</span>

<p><span class="bibleverse">41</span> Now while the Pharisees were

Whose son is he?” They said to him, “Of David.” <span
class="bibleverse">43</span> He said to them, “How then does David in

class="bibleverse">25</span> I was afraid, and went away and hid your
talent in the earth. Behold, you have what is yours.’ <span
class="bibleverse">26</span> “But his lord answered him, ‘You wicked and
slothful servant. You knew that I reap where I didn’t sow, and gather
where I didn’t scatter. <span class="bibleverse">27</span> You ought
therefore to have deposited my money with the bankers, and at my coming
I should have received back my own with interest. <span
class="bibleverse">28</span> Take away therefore the talent from him and
give it to him who has the ten talents. <span

he will have abundance, but from him who doesn’t have, even that which
he has will be taken away. <span class="bibleverse">30</span> Throw out
the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness, where there will be

words, he said to his disciples, <span class="bibleverse">2</span> “You
know that after two days the Passover is coming, and the Son of Man will
be delivered up to be crucified.” <span class="bibleverse">3</span> Then
the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders of the people were
gathered together in the court of the high priest, who was called
Caiaphas. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> They took counsel together
that they might take Jesus by deceit and kill him. <span

riot occur amongst the people.”</p>
<h2 id="anointing-of-jesus-in-bethany">Anointing of Jesus in

<p><span class="bibleverse">6</span> Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in
the house of Simon the leper, <span class="bibleverse">7</span> a woman
came to him having an alabaster jar of very expensive ointment, and she
poured it on his head as he sat at the table. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> But when his disciples saw this, they were
indignant, saying, “Why this waste? <span class="bibleverse">9</span>
For this ointment might have been sold for much and given to the poor.”
<span class="bibleverse">10</span> However, knowing this, Jesus said to
them, “Why do you trouble the woman? She has done a good work for me.
<span class="bibleverse">11</span> For you always have the poor with
you, but you don’t always have me. <span class="bibleverse">12</span>
For in pouring this ointment on my body, she did it to prepare me for
burial. <span class="bibleverse">13</span> Most certainly I tell you,

has done will also be spoken of as a memorial of her.”</p>
<h2 id="betrayal-of-judas">Betrayal of Judas</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">14</span> Then one of the twelve, who was

opportunity to betray him.</p>
<h2 id="easter-meal-preparation">Easter meal preparation</h2>

person, and tell him, ‘The Teacher says, “My time is at hand. I will

<p><span class="bibleverse">20</span> Now when evening had come, he was
reclining at the table with the twelve disciples. <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> As they were eating, he said, “Most
certainly I tell you that one of you will betray me.” <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> They were exceedingly sorrowful, and each
began to ask him, “It isn’t me, is it, Lord?” <span
class="bibleverse">23</span> He answered, “He who dipped his hand with
me in the dish will betray me. <span class="bibleverse">24</span> The
Son of Man goes even as it is written of him, but woe to that man
through whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would be better for that man

betrayed him, answered, “It isn’t me, is it, Rabbi?” He said to him,
“You said it.” <span class="bibleverse">26</span> As they were eating,
Jesus took bread, gave thanks for<a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref"

gave to the disciples and said, “Take, eat; this is my body.” <span
class="bibleverse">27</span> He took the cup, gave thanks, and gave to
them, saying, “All of you drink it, <span class="bibleverse">28</span>
for this is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many
for the remission of sins. <span class="bibleverse">29</span> But I tell
you that I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on, until

<h2 id="walk-to-gethsemane">Walk to Gethsemane</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">30</span> When they had sung a hymn, they
went out to the Mount of Olives. <span class="bibleverse">31</span> Then

him, “Even if all will be made to stumble because of you, I will never
be made to stumble.” <span class="bibleverse">34</span> Jesus said to
him, “Most certainly I tell you that tonight, before the rooster crows,
you will deny me three times.” <span class="bibleverse">35</span> Peter
said to him, “Even if I must die with you, I will not deny you.” All of

<p><span class="bibleverse">36</span> Then Jesus came with them to a
place called Gethsemane, and said to his disciples, “Sit here, while I
go there and pray.” <span class="bibleverse">37</span> He took with him
Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and
severely troubled. <span class="bibleverse">38</span> Then he said to
them, “My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Stay here and
watch with me.” <span class="bibleverse">39</span> He went forward a
little, fell on his face, and prayed, saying, “My Father, if it is
possible, let this cup pass away from me; nevertheless, not what I
desire, but what you desire.” <span class="bibleverse">40</span> He came
to the disciples and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, “What,
couldn’t you watch with me for one hour? <span
class="bibleverse">41</span> Watch and pray, that you don’t enter into
temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.” <span
class="bibleverse">42</span> Again, a second time he went away and
prayed, saying, “My Father, if this cup can’t pass away from me unless I
drink it, your desire be done.” <span class="bibleverse">43</span> He
came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy. <span
class="bibleverse">44</span> He left them again, went away, and prayed a
third time, saying the same words. <span class="bibleverse">45</span>
Then he came to his disciples and said to them, “Are you still sleeping
and resting? Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is betrayed
into the hands of sinners. <span class="bibleverse">46</span> Arise,
let’s be going. Behold, he who betrays me is at hand.”</p>
<h2 id="imprisonment-of-jesus-disciples-escape">Imprisonment of Jesus;

<p><span class="bibleverse">47</span> While he was still speaking,
behold, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude
with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and elders of the people.
<span class="bibleverse">48</span> Now he who betrayed him had given
them a sign, saying, “Whoever I kiss, he is the one. Seize him.” <span
class="bibleverse">49</span> Immediately he came to Jesus, and said,
“Greetings, Rabbi!” and kissed him. <span class="bibleverse">50</span>
Jesus said to him, “Friend, why are you here?” Then they came and laid
hands on Jesus, and took him. <span class="bibleverse">51</span> Behold,
one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his
sword, and struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.
<span class="bibleverse">52</span> Then Jesus said to him, “Put your
sword back into its place, for all those who take the sword will die by
the sword. <span class="bibleverse">53</span> Or do you think that I
couldn’t ask my Father, and he would even now send me more than twelve
legions of angels? <span class="bibleverse">54</span> How then would the
Scriptures be fulfilled that it must be so?” <span
class="bibleverse">55</span> In that hour Jesus said to the multitudes,
“Have you come out as against a robber with swords and clubs to seize
me? I sat daily in the temple teaching, and you didn’t arrest me. <span
class="bibleverse">56</span> But all this has happened that the
Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.” Then all the disciples
left him and fled.</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">57</span> Those who had taken Jesus led him
away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were
gathered together. <span class="bibleverse">58</span> But Peter followed
him from a distance to the court of the high priest, and entered in and
sat with the officers, to see the end. <span
class="bibleverse">59</span> Now the chief priests, the elders, and the
whole council sought false testimony against Jesus, that they might put
him to death, <span class="bibleverse">60</span> and they found none.
Even though many false witnesses came forward, they found none. But at
last two false witnesses came forward <span class="bibleverse">61</span>
and said, “This man said, ‘I am able to destroy the temple of God, and
to build it in three days.’” <span class="bibleverse">62</span> The high
priest stood up and said to him, “Have you no answer? What is this that
these testify against you?” <span class="bibleverse">63</span> But Jesus
stayed silent. The high priest answered him, “I adjure you by the living
God that you tell us whether you are the Christ, the Son of God.” <span
class="bibleverse">64</span> Jesus said to him, “You have said so.
Nevertheless, I tell you, after this you will see the Son of Man sitting
at the right hand of Power, and coming on the clouds of the sky.” <span
class="bibleverse">65</span> Then the high priest tore his clothing,
saying, “He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses?
Behold, now you have heard his blasphemy. <span
class="bibleverse">66</span> What do you think?” They answered, “He is
worthy of death!” <span class="bibleverse">67</span> Then they spat in
his face and beat him with their fists, and some slapped him, <span

hit you?”</p>
<h2 id="peters-denial-and-repentance">Peter's denial and repentance</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">69</span> Now Peter was sitting outside in
the court, and a maid came to him, saying, “You were also with Jesus,
the Galilean!” <span class="bibleverse">70</span> But he denied it
before them all, saying, “I don’t know what you are talking about.”
<span class="bibleverse">71</span> When he had gone out onto the porch,
someone else saw him and said to those who were there, “This man also
was with Jesus of Nazareth.” <span class="bibleverse">72</span> Again he
denied it with an oath, “I don’t know the man.” <span
class="bibleverse">73</span> After a little while those who stood by
came and said to Peter, “Surely you are also one of them, for your
speech makes you known.” <span class="bibleverse">74</span> Then he
began to curse and to swear, “I don’t know the man!” Immediately the
rooster crowed. <span class="bibleverse">75</span> Peter remembered the
word which Jesus had said to him, “Before the rooster crows, you will
deny me three times.” Then he went out and wept bitterly.</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Now when morning had come, all the
chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to
put him to death. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> They bound him, led
him away, and delivered him up to Pontius Pilate, the governor. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> Then Judas, who betrayed him, when he saw
that Jesus was condemned, felt remorse, and brought back the thirty
pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders, <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> saying, “I have sinned in that I betrayed
innocent blood.” But they said, “What is that to us? You see to it.”
<span class="bibleverse">5</span> He threw down the pieces of silver in
the sanctuary and departed. Then he went away and hanged himself. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> The chief priests took the pieces of silver
and said, “It’s not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is
the price of blood.” <span class="bibleverse">7</span> They took
counsel, and bought the potter’s field with them to bury strangers in.
<span class="bibleverse">8</span> Therefore that field has been called
“The Field of Blood” to this day. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> Then
that which was spoken through Jeremiah<a href="#fn138"

the prophet was fulfilled, saying, “They took the thirty pieces of
silver, the price of him upon whom a price had been set, whom some of
the children of Israel priced, <span class="bibleverse">10</span> and
they gave them for the potter’s field, as the Lord commanded me.”<a

Jews?” Jesus said to him, “So you say.” <span

and elders, he answered nothing. <span class="bibleverse">13</span> Then
Pilate said to him, “Don’t you hear how many things they testify against
you?” <span class="bibleverse">14</span> He gave him no answer, not even
one word, so that the governor marvelled greatly.</p>
<h2 id="jesus-and-barabbas">Jesus and Barabbas</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">15</span> Now at the feast the governor was
accustomed to release to the multitude one prisoner whom they desired.
<span class="bibleverse">16</span> They had then a notable prisoner
called Barabbas. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> When therefore they
were gathered together, Pilate said to them, “Whom do you want me to
release to you? Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?” <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> For he knew that because of envy they had
delivered him up. <span class="bibleverse">19</span> While he was
sitting on the judgement seat, his wife sent to him, saying, “Have
nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered many things
today in a dream because of him.” <span class="bibleverse">20</span> Now
the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitudes to ask for
Barabbas and destroy Jesus. <span class="bibleverse">21</span> But the
governor answered them, “Which of the two do you want me to release to
you?” They said, “Barabbas!” <span class="bibleverse">22</span> Pilate
said to them, “What then shall I do to Jesus who is called Christ?” They
all said to him, “Let him be crucified!” <span
class="bibleverse">23</span> But the governor said, “Why? What evil has
he done?” But they cried out exceedingly, saying, “Let him be
crucified!” <span class="bibleverse">24</span> So when Pilate saw that
nothing was being gained, but rather that a disturbance was starting, he
took water and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, “I am
innocent of the blood of this righteous person. You see to it.” <span
class="bibleverse">25</span> All the people answered, “May his blood be
on us and on our children!” <span class="bibleverse">26</span> Then he
released Barabbas to them, but Jesus he flogged and delivered to be
crucified.</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">27</span> Then the governor’s soldiers took

put a scarlet robe on him. <span class="bibleverse">29</span> They
braided a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and a reed in his
right hand; and they knelt down before him and mocked him, saying,
“Hail, King of the Jews!” <span class="bibleverse">30</span> They spat
on him, and took the reed and struck him on the head. <span

he might carry his cross. <span class="bibleverse">33</span> When they

there were two robbers crucified with him, one on his right hand and one

and saying, “You who destroy the temple and build it in three days, save

with the scribes, the Pharisees,<a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref"

said, <span class="bibleverse">42</span> “He saved others, but he can’t

sponge, filled it with vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave him a drink.
<span class="bibleverse">49</span> The rest said, “Let him be. Let’s see
whether Elijah comes to save him.” <span class="bibleverse">50</span>
Jesus cried again with a loud voice, and yielded up his spirit. <span

two from the top to the bottom. The earth quaked and the rocks were
split. <span class="bibleverse">52</span> The tombs were opened, and
many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised; <span
class="bibleverse">53</span> and coming out of the tombs after his
resurrection, they entered into the holy city and appeared to many.
<span class="bibleverse">54</span> Now the centurion and those who were
with him watching Jesus, when they saw the earthquake and the things
that were done, were terrified, saying, “Truly this was the Son of God!”
<span class="bibleverse">55</span> Many women were there watching from
afar, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, serving him. <span

asked for Jesus’ body. Then Pilate commanded the body to be given up.
<span class="bibleverse">59</span> Joseph took the body and wrapped it
in a clean linen cloth <span class="bibleverse">60</span> and laid it in
his own new tomb, which he had cut out in the rock. Then he rolled a
large stone against the door of the tomb, and departed. <span

Mary, sitting opposite the tomb. <span class="bibleverse">62</span> Now
on the next day, which was the day after the Preparation Day, the chief

deceiver said while he was still alive: ‘After three days I will rise
again.’ <span class="bibleverse">64</span> Command therefore that the

<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Now after the Sabbath, as it began
to dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary
came to see the tomb. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> Behold, there
was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from the sky
and came and rolled away the stone from the door and sat on it. <span

clothing white as snow. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> For fear of
him, the guards shook, and became like dead men. <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> The angel answered the women, “Don’t be
afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus, who has been crucified. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> He is not here, for he has risen, just like
he said. Come, see the place where the Lord was lying. <span

risen from the dead, and behold, he goes before you into Galilee; there
you will see him.’ Behold, I have told you.” <span

fear and great joy, and ran to bring his disciples word. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> As they went to tell his disciples, behold,
Jesus met them, saying, “Rejoice!” They came and took hold of his feet,
and worshipped him. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> Then Jesus said
to them, “Don’t be afraid. Go tell my brothers <a href="#fn148"

were assembled with the elders and had taken counsel, they gave a large
