corruptly! They have forsaken the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>.
They have despised the Holy One of Israel. They are estranged and

whole heart faint. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> From the sole of
the foot even to the head there is no soundness in it, but wounds,
welts, and open sores. They haven’t been closed, bandaged, or soothed
with oil. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> Your country is desolate.
Your cities are burnt with fire. Strangers devour your land in your
presence and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers. <span

<span class="bibleverse">9</span> Unless the <span

<span class="bibleverse">12</span> When you come to appear before me,
who has required this at your hand, to trample my courts? <span

and keep calm. Don’t be afraid, neither let your heart be faint because
of these two tails of smoking torches, for the fierce anger of Rezin and
Syria, and of the son of Remaliah. <span class="bibleverse">5</span>
Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have plotted evil
against you, saying, <span class="bibleverse">6</span> “Let’s go up
against Judah, and tear it apart, and let’s divide it amongst ourselves,
and set up a king within it, even the son of Tabeel.” <span

not stand, neither shall it happen.” <span class="bibleverse">8</span>
For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin.
Within sixty-five years Ephraim shall be broken in pieces, so that it
shall not be a people. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> The head of
Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah’s son. If you
will not believe, surely you shall not be established.’”</p>

its going out, and the moon will not cause its light to shine. <span

the wicked for their iniquity. I will cause the arrogance of the proud

gold, even a person than the pure gold of Ophir. <span

and the earth will be shaken out of its place in the <span

like a hunted gazelle and like sheep that no one gathers, they will each

the young men in pieces; and they shall have no pity on the fruit of the

Ostriches will dwell there, and wild goats will frolic there. <span

jackals in the pleasant palaces. Her time is near to come, and her days

through, it won’t come to us; for we have made lies our refuge, and we
have hidden ourselves under falsehood.’” <span

in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious cornerstone
of a sure foundation. He who believes shall not act hastily. <span

righteousness the plumb line. The hail will sweep away the refuge of
lies, and the waters will overflow the hiding place. <span

and your agreement with Sheol<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref"

the overflowing scourge passes through, then you will be trampled down
by it. <span class="bibleverse">19</span> As often as it passes through,
it will seize you; for morning by morning it will pass through, by day
and by night; and it will be nothing but terror to understand the
message.” <span class="bibleverse">20</span> For the bed is too short to
stretch out on, and the blanket is too narrow to wrap oneself in. <span

“Behold, my servants will eat, but you will be hungry; behold, my
servants will drink, but you will be thirsty. Behold, my servants will
rejoice, but you will be disappointed. <span

heart, but you will cry for sorrow of heart, and will wail for anguish
of spirit. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> You will leave your name
for a curse to my chosen, and the Lord GOD will kill you. He will call
his servants by another name, <span class="bibleverse">16</span> so that

rejoice in Jerusalem, and delight in my people; and the voice of weeping
and the voice of crying will be heard in her no more. <span

lives a few days, nor an old man who has not filled his days; for the
child will die one hundred years old, and the sinner being one hundred
years old will be accursed. <span class="bibleverse">21</span> They will
build houses and inhabit them. They will plant vineyards and eat their
fruit. <span class="bibleverse">22</span> They will not build and
another inhabit. They will not plant and another eat; for the days of my
people will be like the days of a tree, and my chosen will long enjoy
the work of their hands. <span class="bibleverse">23</span> They will
not labour in vain nor give birth for calamity; for they are the
offspring of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s blessed and their
descendants with them. <span class="bibleverse">24</span> It will happen
that before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I
will hear. <span class="bibleverse">25</span> The wolf and the lamb will

he who sacrifices a lamb, as he who breaks a dog’s neck; he who offers
an offering, as he who offers pig’s blood; he who burns frankincense, as
he who blesses an idol. Yes, they have chosen their own ways, and their
soul delights in their abominations. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> I
also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears on them,
