<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Since many have undertaken to set
in order a narrative concerning those matters which have been fulfilled
amongst us, <span class="bibleverse">2</span> even as those who from the
beginning were eyewitnesses and servants of the word delivered them to
us, <span class="bibleverse">3</span> it seemed good to me also, having
traced the course of all things accurately from the first, to write to
you in order, most excellent Theophilus; <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> that you might know the certainty concerning
the things in which you were instructed.</p>
<h2 id="announcement-of-the-birth-of-john-the-baptist">Announcement of
the birth of John the Baptist</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">5</span> There was in the days of Herod, the
king of Judea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the priestly
division of Abijah. He had a wife of the daughters of Aaron, and her
name was Elizabeth. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> They were both
righteous before God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments and
ordinances of the Lord. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> But they had
no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they both were well advanced
in years. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> Now while he executed the
priest’s office before God in the order of his division <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> according to the custom of the priest’s
office, his lot was to enter into the temple of the Lord and burn
incense. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> The whole multitude of the
people were praying outside at the hour of incense. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> An angel of the Lord appeared to him,
standing on the right side of the altar of incense. <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> Zacharias was troubled when he saw him, and
fear fell upon him. <span class="bibleverse">13</span> But the angel
said to him, “Don’t be afraid, Zacharias, because your request has been
heard. Your wife, Elizabeth, will bear you a son, and you shall call his
name John. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> You will have joy and
gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> For he will be great in the sight of the
Lord, and he will drink no wine nor strong drink. He will be filled with
the Holy Spirit, even from his mother’s womb. <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> He will turn many of the children of Israel
to the Lord their God. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> He will go
before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, ‘to turn the hearts of the
fathers to the children,’<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> and the disobedient to the wisdom of
the just; to prepare a people prepared for the Lord.” <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> Zacharias said to the angel, “How can I be
sure of this? For I am an old man, and my wife is well advanced in
years.” <span class="bibleverse">19</span> The angel answered him, “I am
Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God. I was sent to speak to you
and to bring you this good news. <span class="bibleverse">20</span>
Behold,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> you will be silent and not able to
speak until the day that these things will happen, because you didn’t
believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their proper time.” <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> The people were waiting for Zacharias, and
they marvelled that he delayed in the temple. <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> When he came out, he could not speak to
them. They perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple. He
continued making signs to them, and remained mute. <span
class="bibleverse">23</span> When the days of his service were
fulfilled, he departed to his house. <span class="bibleverse">24</span>
After these days Elizabeth his wife conceived, and she hid herself five
months, saying, <span class="bibleverse">25</span> “Thus has the Lord
done to me in the days in which he looked at me, to take away my
reproach amongst men.”</p>
<h2 id="announcing-the-birth-of-jesus">Announcing the birth of
Jesus</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">26</span> Now in the sixth month, the angel
Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth, <span
class="bibleverse">27</span> to a virgin pledged to be married to a man
whose name was Joseph, of David’s house. The virgin’s name was Mary.
<span class="bibleverse">28</span> Having come in, the angel said to
her, “Rejoice, you highly favoured one! The Lord is with you. Blessed
are you amongst women!” <span class="bibleverse">29</span> But when she
saw him, she was greatly troubled at the saying, and considered what
kind of salutation this might be. <span class="bibleverse">30</span> The
angel said to her, “Don’t be afraid, Mary, for you have found favour
with God. <span class="bibleverse">31</span> Behold, you will conceive
in your womb and give birth to a son, and shall name him ‘Jesus.’ <span
class="bibleverse">32</span> He will be great and will be called the Son
of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father
David, <span class="bibleverse">33</span> and he will reign over the
house of Jacob forever. There will be no end to his Kingdom.” <span
class="bibleverse">34</span> Mary said to the angel, “How can this be,
seeing I am a virgin?” <span class="bibleverse">35</span> The angel
answered her, “The Holy Spirit will come on you, and the power of the
Most High will overshadow you. Therefore also the holy one who is born
from you will be called the Son of God. <span
class="bibleverse">36</span> Behold, Elizabeth your relative also has
conceived a son in her old age; and this is the sixth month with her who
was called barren. <span class="bibleverse">37</span> For nothing spoken
by God is impossible.”<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> <span class="bibleverse">38</span>
Mary said, “Behold, the servant of the Lord; let it be done to me
according to your word.” Then the angel departed from her.</p>
<h2 id="the-meeting-of-the-two-mothers-greetings-from-elizabeth">The
meeting of the two mothers; Greetings from Elizabeth</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">39</span> Mary arose in those days and went
into the hill country with haste, into a city of Judah, <span
class="bibleverse">40</span> and entered into the house of Zacharias and
greeted Elizabeth. <span class="bibleverse">41</span> When Elizabeth
heard Mary’s greeting, the baby leapt in her womb; and Elizabeth was
filled with the Holy Spirit. <span class="bibleverse">42</span> She
called out with a loud voice and said, “Blessed are you amongst women,
and blessed is the fruit of your womb! <span
class="bibleverse">43</span> Why am I so favoured, that the mother of my
Lord should come to me? <span class="bibleverse">44</span> For behold,
when the voice of your greeting came into my ears, the baby leapt in my
womb for joy! <span class="bibleverse">45</span> Blessed is she who
believed, for there will be a fulfilment of the things which have been
spoken to her from the Lord!”</p>
<h2 id="mary-praise-song">Mary Praise Song</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">46</span> Mary said, “My soul magnifies the
Lord. <span class="bibleverse">47</span> My spirit has rejoiced in God
my Saviour, <span class="bibleverse">48</span> for he has looked at the
humble state of his servant. For behold, from now on, all generations
will call me blessed. <span class="bibleverse">49</span> For he who is
mighty has done great things for me. Holy is his name. <span
class="bibleverse">50</span> His mercy is for generations and
generations on those who fear him. <span class="bibleverse">51</span> He
has shown strength with his arm. He has scattered the proud in the
imagination of their hearts. <span class="bibleverse">52</span> He has
put down princes from their thrones, and has exalted the lowly. <span
class="bibleverse">53</span> He has filled the hungry with good things.
He has sent the rich away empty. <span class="bibleverse">54</span> He
has given help to Israel, his servant, that he might remember mercy,
<span class="bibleverse">55</span> as he spoke to our fathers, to
Abraham and his offspring<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> forever.” <span
class="bibleverse">56</span> Mary stayed with her about three months,
and then returned to her house.</p>
<h2 id="birth-circumcision-and-youth-of-john-zechariah-hymn">Birth,
circumcision and youth of John; Zechariah Hymn</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">57</span> Now the time that Elizabeth should
give birth was fulfilled, and she gave birth to a son. <span
class="bibleverse">58</span> Her neighbours and her relatives heard that
the Lord had magnified his mercy towards her, and they rejoiced with
her. <span class="bibleverse">59</span> On the eighth day, they came to
circumcise the child; and they would have called him Zacharias, after
the name of his father. <span class="bibleverse">60</span> His mother
answered, “Not so; but he will be called John.” <span
class="bibleverse">61</span> They said to her, “There is no one amongst
your relatives who is called by this name.” <span
class="bibleverse">62</span> They made signs to his father, what he
would have him called. <span class="bibleverse">63</span> He asked for a
writing tablet, and wrote, “His name is John.” They all marvelled. <span
class="bibleverse">64</span> His mouth was opened immediately and his
tongue freed, and he spoke, blessing God. <span
class="bibleverse">65</span> Fear came on all who lived around them, and
all these sayings were talked about throughout all the hill country of
Judea. <span class="bibleverse">66</span> All who heard them laid them
up in their heart, saying, “What then will this child be?” The hand of
the Lord was with him.</p>
<h2 id="prophetic-hymn-of-praise-of-zechariah">Prophetic Hymn of Praise
of Zechariah</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">67</span> His father Zacharias was filled
with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying, <span
class="bibleverse">68</span> “Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel,
for he has visited and redeemed his people; <span
class="bibleverse">69</span> and has raised up a horn of salvation for
us in the house of his servant David <span class="bibleverse">70</span>
(as he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets who have been from of
old), <span class="bibleverse">71</span> salvation from our enemies and
from the hand of all who hate us; <span class="bibleverse">72</span> to
show mercy towards our fathers, to remember his holy covenant, <span
class="bibleverse">73</span> the oath which he swore to Abraham our
father, <span class="bibleverse">74</span> to grant to us that we, being
delivered out of the hand of our enemies, should serve him without fear,
<span class="bibleverse">75</span> in holiness and righteousness before
him all the days of our life. <span class="bibleverse">76</span> And
you, child, will be called a prophet of the Most High; for you will go
before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways, <span
class="bibleverse">77</span> to give knowledge of salvation to his
people by the remission of their sins, <span
class="bibleverse">78</span> because of the tender mercy of our God, by
which the dawn from on high will visit us, <span
class="bibleverse">79</span> to shine on those who sit in darkness and
the shadow of death; to guide our feet into the way of peace.” <span
class="bibleverse">80</span> The child was growing and becoming strong
in spirit, and was in the desert until the day of his public appearance
to Israel.</p>

decree of Emperor Augustus and its meaning for the birth of Jesus</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Now in those days, a decree went
out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be enrolled. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> This was the first enrolment made when
Quirinius was governor of Syria. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> All
went to enrol themselves, everyone to his own city. <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the
city of Nazareth, into Judea, to David’s city, which is called
Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David, <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> to enrol himself with Mary, who was pledged
to be married to him as wife, being pregnant. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> While they were there, the day had come for
her to give birth. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> She gave birth to
her firstborn son. She wrapped him in bands of cloth and laid him in a
feeding trough, because there was no room for them in the inn.</p>
<h2 id="the-shepherds-in-the-field-and-the-angelic-apparition">The
shepherds in the field and the angelic apparition</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">8</span> There were shepherds in the same
country staying in the field, and keeping watch by night over their
flock. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> Behold, an angel of the Lord
stood by them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they
were terrified. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> The angel said to
them, “Don’t be afraid, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy
which will be to all the people. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> For
there is born to you today, in David’s city, a Saviour, who is Christ<a
href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> the Lord. <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> This is the sign to you: you will find a
baby wrapped in strips of cloth, lying in a feeding trough.” <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> Suddenly, there was with the angel a
multitude of the heavenly army praising God and saying, <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> “Glory to God in the highest, on earth
peace, good will towards men.”</p>
<h2 id="the-shepherds-with-the-baby-jesus-in-bethlehem">The shepherds

<p><span class="bibleverse">15</span> When the angels went away from
them into the sky, the shepherds said to one another, “Let’s go to
Bethlehem, now, and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has
made known to us.” <span class="bibleverse">16</span> They came with
haste and found both Mary and Joseph, and the baby was lying in the
feeding trough. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> When they saw it,
they publicised widely the saying which was spoken to them about this
child. <span class="bibleverse">18</span> All who heard it wondered at
the things which were spoken to them by the shepherds. <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> But Mary kept all these sayings, pondering
them in her heart. <span class="bibleverse">20</span> The shepherds
returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had
heard and seen, just as it was told them.</p>
<h2

and presentation of Jesus in the temple</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">21</span> When eight days were fulfilled for
the circumcision of the child, his name was called Jesus, which was
given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb. <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> When the days of their purification
according to the law of Moses were fulfilled, they brought him up to
Jerusalem to present him to the Lord <span class="bibleverse">23</span>
(as it is written in the law of the Lord, “Every male who opens the womb
shall be called holy to the Lord”),<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref"

<p><span class="bibleverse">25</span> Behold, there was a man in
Jerusalem whose name was Simeon. This man was righteous and devout,
looking for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was on him.
<span class="bibleverse">26</span> It had been revealed to him by the
Holy Spirit that he should not see death before he had seen the Lord’s
Christ.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> <span class="bibleverse">27</span>
He came in the Spirit into the temple. When the parents brought in the
child, Jesus, that they might do concerning him according to the custom
of the law, <span class="bibleverse">28</span> then he received him into
his arms and blessed God, and said, <span class="bibleverse">29</span>
“Now you are releasing your servant, Master, according to your word, in
peace; <span class="bibleverse">30</span> for my eyes have seen your
salvation, <span class="bibleverse">31</span> which you have prepared
before the face of all peoples; <span class="bibleverse">32</span> a
light for revelation to the nations, and the glory of your people
Israel.” <span class="bibleverse">33</span> Joseph and his mother were
marvelling at the things which were spoken concerning him. <span
class="bibleverse">34</span> Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary, his
mother, “Behold, this child is appointed for the falling and the rising
of many in Israel, and for a sign which is spoken against. <span
class="bibleverse">35</span> Yes, a sword will pierce through your own
soul, that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.”</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">36</span> There was one Anna, a prophetess,
the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher (she was of a great age,
having lived with a husband seven years from her virginity, <span
class="bibleverse">37</span> and she had been a widow for about
eighty-four years), who didn’t depart from the temple, worshipping with
fastings and petitions night and day. <span class="bibleverse">38</span>
Coming up at that very hour, she gave thanks to the Lord, and spoke of
him to all those who were looking for redemption in Jerusalem. <span
class="bibleverse">39</span> When they had accomplished all things that
were according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to
their own city, Nazareth. <span class="bibleverse">40</span> The child
was growing, and was becoming strong in spirit, being filled with
wisdom, and the grace of God was upon him.</p>
<h2 id="the-twelve-year-old-baby-jesus-in-the-temple">The twelve year

<p><span class="bibleverse">41</span> His parents went every year to
Jerusalem at the feast of the Passover. <span
class="bibleverse">42</span> When he was twelve years old, they went up
to Jerusalem according to the custom of the feast; <span
class="bibleverse">43</span> and when they had fulfilled the days, as
they were returning, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem. Joseph
and his mother didn’t know it, <span class="bibleverse">44</span> but
supposing him to be in the company, they went a day’s journey; and they
looked for him amongst their relatives and acquaintances. <span
class="bibleverse">45</span> When they didn’t find him, they returned to
Jerusalem, looking for him. <span class="bibleverse">46</span> After
three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the middle of the
teachers, both listening to them and asking them questions. <span
class="bibleverse">47</span> All who heard him were amazed at his
understanding and his answers. <span class="bibleverse">48</span> When
they saw him, they were astonished; and his mother said to him, “Son,
why have you treated us this way? Behold, your father and I were
anxiously looking for you.” <span class="bibleverse">49</span> He said
to them, “Why were you looking for me? Didn’t you know that I must be in
my Father’s house?” <span class="bibleverse">50</span> They didn’t
understand the saying which he spoke to them. <span
class="bibleverse">51</span> And he went down with them and came to
Nazareth. He was subject to them, and his mother kept all these sayings
in her heart. <span class="bibleverse">52</span> And Jesus increased in
wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and men.</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Now in the fifteenth year of the
reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, and
Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of the
region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene,
<span class="bibleverse">2</span> during the high priesthood of Annas
and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John, the son of Zacharias, in the
wilderness. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> He came into all the
region around the Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance for
remission of sins. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> As it is written in
the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, “The voice of one crying in
the wilderness, ‘Make ready the way of the Lord. Make his paths
straight. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> Every valley will be filled.
Every mountain and hill will be brought low. The crooked will become
straight, and the rough ways smooth. <span class="bibleverse">6</span>
All flesh will see God’s salvation.’”<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> <span

out to be baptised by him, “You offspring of vipers, who warned you to
flee from the wrath to come? <span class="bibleverse">8</span> Therefore
produce fruits worthy of repentance, and don’t begin to say amongst
yourselves, ‘We have Abraham for our father;’ for I tell you that God is
able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones! <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> Even now the axe also lies at the root of
the trees. Every tree therefore that doesn’t produce good fruit is cut
down and thrown into the fire.” <span class="bibleverse">10</span> The
multitudes asked him, “What then must we do?” <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> He answered them, “He who has two coats,
let him give to him who has none. He who has food, let him do likewise.”
<span class="bibleverse">12</span> Tax collectors also came to be
baptised, and they said to him, “Teacher, what must we do?” <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> He said to them, “Collect no more than that
which is appointed to you.” <span class="bibleverse">14</span> Soldiers
also asked him, saying, “What about us? What must we do?” He said to
them, “Extort from no one by violence, neither accuse anyone wrongfully.
Be content with your wages.” <span class="bibleverse">15</span> As the
people were in expectation, and all men reasoned in their hearts
concerning John, whether perhaps he was the Christ, <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> John answered them all, “I indeed baptise
you with water, but he comes who is mightier than I, the strap of whose
sandals I am not worthy to loosen. He will baptise you in the Holy
Spirit and fire. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> His winnowing fan is
in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor, and
will gather the wheat into his barn; but he will burn up the chaff with
unquenchable fire.” <span class="bibleverse">18</span> Then with many
other exhortations he preached good news to the people, <span

appearance of Jesus in Galilee; his preaching and rejection in his
native Nazareth</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">14</span> Jesus returned in the power of the
Spirit into Galilee, and news about him spread through all the
surrounding area. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> He taught in their
synagogues, being glorified by all. <span class="bibleverse">16</span>
He came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up. He entered, as was
his custom, into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood up to read.
<span class="bibleverse">17</span> The book of the prophet Isaiah was
handed to him. He opened the book, and found the place where it was
written, <span class="bibleverse">18</span> “The Spirit of the Lord is
on me, because he has anointed me to preach good news to the poor. He
has sent me to heal the broken hearted,<a href="#fn17"

to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.”<a href="#fn18"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a>
<span class="bibleverse">20</span> He closed the book, gave it back to
the attendant, and sat down. The eyes of all in the synagogue were
fastened on him. <span class="bibleverse">21</span> He began to tell
them, “Today, this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.” <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> All testified about him and wondered at the
gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth; and they said, “Isn’t
this Joseph’s son?” <span class="bibleverse">23</span> He said to them,
“Doubtless you will tell me this proverb, ‘Physician, heal yourself!
Whatever we have heard done at Capernaum, do also here in your
hometown.’” <span class="bibleverse">24</span> He said, “Most certainly
I tell you, no prophet is acceptable in his hometown. <span
class="bibleverse">25</span> But truly I tell you, there were many
widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the sky was shut up three
years and six months, when a great famine came over all the land. <span
class="bibleverse">26</span> Elijah was sent to none of them, except to
Zarephath, in the land of Sidon, to a woman who was a widow. <span
class="bibleverse">27</span> There were many lepers in Israel in the
time of Elisha the prophet, yet not one of them was cleansed, except
Naaman, the Syrian.” <span class="bibleverse">28</span> They were all
filled with wrath in the synagogue as they heard these things. <span
class="bibleverse">29</span> They rose up, threw him out of the city,
and led him to the brow of the hill that their city was built on, that
they might throw him off the cliff. <span class="bibleverse">30</span>

for his word was with authority. <span class="bibleverse">33</span> In
the synagogue there was a man who had a spirit of an unclean demon; and
he cried out with a loud voice, <span class="bibleverse">34</span>
saying, “Ah! what have we to do with you, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you
come to destroy us? I know who you are: the Holy One of God!” <span
class="bibleverse">35</span> Jesus rebuked him, saying, “Be silent and
come out of him!” When the demon had thrown him down in the middle of
them, he came out of him, having done him no harm. <span
class="bibleverse">36</span> Amazement came on all and they spoke
together, one with another, saying, “What is this word? For with
authority and power he commands the unclean spirits, and they come out!”

great fever, and they begged him to help her. <span

and it left her. Immediately she rose up and served them. <span
class="bibleverse">40</span> When the sun was setting, all those who had
any sick with various diseases brought them to him; and he laid his
hands on every one of them, and healed them. <span

and saying, “You are the Christ, the Son of God!” Rebuking them, he
didn’t allow them to speak, because they knew that he was the

<span class="bibleverse">43</span> But he said to them, “I must preach

Gennesaret. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> He saw two boats standing
by the lake, but the fishermen had gone out of them and were washing
their nets. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> He entered into one of the
boats, which was Simon’s, and asked him to put out a little from the
land. He sat down and taught the multitudes from the boat. <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> When he had finished speaking, he said to
Simon, “Put out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch.” <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> Simon answered him, “Master, we worked all
night and caught nothing; but at your word I will let down the net.”
<span class="bibleverse">6</span> When they had done this, they caught a
great multitude of fish, and their net was breaking. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> They beckoned to their partners in the other
boat, that they should come and help them. They came and filled both
boats, so that they began to sink. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> But
Simon Peter, when he saw it, fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying, “Depart
from me, for I am a sinful man, Lord.” <span class="bibleverse">9</span>
For he was amazed, and all who were with him, at the catch of fish which
they had caught; <span class="bibleverse">10</span> and so also were
James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. Jesus
said to Simon, “Don’t be afraid. From now on you will be catching people
alive.” <span class="bibleverse">11</span> When they had brought their
boats to land, they left everything, and followed him.</p>

touched him, saying, “I want to. Be made clean.” Immediately the leprosy
left him. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> He commanded him to tell no

your cleansing according to what Moses commanded, for a testimony to
them.” <span class="bibleverse">15</span> But the report concerning him
spread much more, and great multitudes came together to hear and to be

<p><span class="bibleverse">17</span> On one of those days, he was
teaching; and there were Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting by
who had come out of every village of Galilee, Judea, and Jerusalem. The
power of the Lord was with him to heal them. <span

cot, and they sought to bring him in to lay before Jesus. <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> Not finding a way to bring him in because
of the multitude, they went up to the housetop and let him down through
the tiles with his cot into the middle before Jesus. <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> Seeing their faith, he said to him, “Man,
your sins are forgiven you.” <span class="bibleverse">21</span> The
scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, “Who is this who
speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?” <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> But Jesus, perceiving their thoughts,
answered them, “Why are you reasoning so in your hearts? <span
class="bibleverse">23</span> Which is easier to say, ‘Your sins are
forgiven you,’ or to say, ‘Arise and walk?’ <span
class="bibleverse">24</span> But that you may know that the Son of Man
has authority on earth to forgive sins,” he said to the paralysed man,
“I tell you, arise, take up your cot, and go to your house.” <span

took up that which he was laying on, and departed to his house,
glorifying God. <span class="bibleverse">26</span> Amazement took hold

made a great feast for him in his house. There was a great crowd of tax

against his disciples, saying, “Why do you eat and drink with the tax

the bridegroom is with them? <span class="bibleverse">35</span> But the
days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them. Then
they will fast in those days.” <span class="bibleverse">36</span> He
also told a parable to them. “No one puts a piece from a new garment on
an old garment, or else he will tear the new, and also the piece from

one puts new wine into old wine skins, or else the new wine will burst

the Sabbath, that they might find an accusation against him. <span

the man who had the withered hand, “Rise up and stand in the middle.” He
arose and stood. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> Then Jesus said to

or to do harm? To save a life, or to kill?” <span

Therefore I didn’t even think myself worthy to come to you; but say the

should we look for another?’” <span class="bibleverse">21</span> In that
hour he cured many of diseases and plagues and evil spirits; and to many
who were blind he gave sight. <span class="bibleverse">22</span> Jesus
answered them, “Go and tell John the things which you have seen and
heard: that the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are
cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have good
news preached to them. <span class="bibleverse">23</span> Blessed is he
who finds no occasion for stumbling in me.” <span
class="bibleverse">24</span> When John’s messengers had departed, he
began to tell the multitudes about John, “What did you go out into the
wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind? <span
class="bibleverse">25</span> But what did you go out to see? A man
clothed in soft clothing? Behold, those who are gorgeously dressed and
live delicately are in kings’ courts. <span class="bibleverse">26</span>
But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and much
more than a prophet. <span class="bibleverse">27</span> This is he of
whom it is written, ‘Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who
will prepare your way before you.’<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> <span
class="bibleverse">28</span> “For I tell you, amongst those who are born
of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptiser; yet he
who is least in God’s Kingdom is greater than he.” <span
class="bibleverse">29</span> When all the people and the tax collectors
heard this, they declared God to be just, having been baptised with
John’s baptism. <span class="bibleverse">30</span> But the Pharisees and
the lawyers rejected the counsel of God, not being baptised by him
themselves. <span class="bibleverse">31</span> <a href="#fn24"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a>
“To what then should I compare the people of this generation? What are
they like? <span class="bibleverse">32</span> They are like children who
sit in the marketplace and call to one another, saying, ‘We piped to
you, and you didn’t dance. We mourned, and you didn’t weep.’ <span
class="bibleverse">33</span> For John the Baptiser came neither eating
bread nor drinking wine, and you say, ‘He has a demon.’ <span
class="bibleverse">34</span> The Son of Man has come eating and
drinking, and you say, ‘Behold, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of
tax collectors and sinners!’ <span class="bibleverse">35</span> Wisdom
is justified by all her children.”</p>
<h2 id="the-anointing-of-jesus-for-the-great-sinner">The anointing of
Jesus for the great sinner</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">36</span> One of the Pharisees invited him
to eat with him. He entered into the Pharisee’s house and sat at the
table. <span class="bibleverse">37</span> Behold, a woman in the city
who was a sinner, when she knew that he was reclining in the Pharisee’s
house, brought an alabaster jar of ointment. <span
class="bibleverse">38</span> Standing behind at his feet weeping, she
began to wet his feet with her tears, and she wiped them with the hair
of her head, kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment. <span
class="bibleverse">39</span> Now when the Pharisee who had invited him
saw it, he said to himself, “This man, if he were a prophet, would have
perceived who and what kind of woman this is who touches him, that she
is a sinner.” <span class="bibleverse">40</span> Jesus answered him,
“Simon, I have something to tell you.” He said, “Teacher, say on.” <span
class="bibleverse">41</span> “A certain lender had two debtors. The one
owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty. <span
class="bibleverse">42</span> When they couldn’t pay, he forgave them
both. Which of them therefore will love him most?” <span
class="bibleverse">43</span> Simon answered, “He, I suppose, to whom he
forgave the most.” He said to him, “You have judged correctly.” <span
class="bibleverse">44</span> Turning to the woman, he said to Simon, “Do
you see this woman? I entered into your house, and you gave me no water
for my feet, but she has wet my feet with her tears, and wiped them with
the hair of her head. <span class="bibleverse">45</span> You gave me no
kiss, but she, since the time I came in, has not ceased to kiss my feet.
<span class="bibleverse">46</span> You didn’t anoint my head with oil,
but she has anointed my feet with ointment. <span
class="bibleverse">47</span> Therefore I tell you, her sins, which are
many, are forgiven, for she loved much. But one to whom little is
forgiven, loves little.” <span class="bibleverse">48</span> He said to
her, “Your sins are forgiven.” <span class="bibleverse">49</span> Those
who sat at the table with him began to say to themselves, “Who is this
who even forgives sins?” <span class="bibleverse">50</span> He said to
the woman, “Your faith has saved you. Go in peace.”</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Soon afterwards, he went about
through cities and villages, preaching and bringing the good news of
God’s Kingdom. With him were the twelve, <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> and certain women who had been healed of
evil spirits and infirmities: Mary who was called Magdalene, from whom
seven demons had gone out; <span class="bibleverse">3</span> and Joanna,

<h2 id="parable-of-the-sower-and-the-field-of-four-types">Parable of the
sower and the field of four types</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">4</span> When a great multitude came
together and people from every city were coming to him, he spoke by a
parable: <span class="bibleverse">5</span> “The farmer went out to sow
his seed. As he sowed, some fell along the road, and it was trampled
under foot, and the birds of the sky devoured it. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> Other seed fell on the rock, and as soon as
it grew, it withered away, because it had no moisture. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> Other fell amid the thorns, and the thorns
grew with it and choked it. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> Other fell
into the good ground and grew and produced one hundred times as much
fruit.” As he said these things, he called out, “He who has ears to
hear, let him hear!”</p>
<h2
id="meaning-and-purpose-of-parables-interpretation-of-the-parable-of-the-sower">Meaning
and purpose of parables; Interpretation of the parable of the sower</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">9</span> Then his disciples asked him, “What
does this parable mean?” <span class="bibleverse">10</span> He said, “To
you it is given to know the mysteries of God’s Kingdom, but to the rest
it is given in parables, that ‘seeing they may not see, and hearing they
may not understand.’<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> <span class="bibleverse">11</span>
“Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God. <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> Those along the road are those who hear;
then the devil comes and takes away the word from their heart, that they
may not believe and be saved. <span class="bibleverse">13</span> Those
on the rock are they who, when they hear, receive the word with joy; but
these have no root. They believe for a while, then fall away in time of
temptation. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> What fell amongst the
thorns, these are those who have heard, and as they go on their way they
are choked with cares, riches, and pleasures of life; and they bring no
fruit to maturity. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> Those in the good
ground, these are those who with an honest and good heart, having heard
the word, hold it tightly, and produce fruit with perseverance. <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> “No one, when he has lit a lamp, covers it
with a container or puts it under a bed; but puts it on a stand, that
those who enter in may see the light. <span class="bibleverse">17</span>
For nothing is hidden that will not be revealed, nor anything secret
that will not be known and come to light. <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> Be careful therefore how you hear. For
whoever has, to him will be given; and whoever doesn’t have, from him
will be taken away even that which he thinks he has.”</p>
<h2 id="the-true-relatives-of-jesus">The true relatives of Jesus</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">19</span> His mother and brothers came to
him, and they could not come near him for the crowd. <span

brothers stand outside, desiring to see you.” <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> But he answered them, “My mother and my

<h2 id="jesus-calms-the-storm-of-the-sea">Jesus calms the storm of the

<p><span class="bibleverse">22</span> Now on one of those days, he
entered into a boat, himself and his disciples, and he said to them,
“Let’s go over to the other side of the lake.” So they launched out.
<span class="bibleverse">23</span> But as they sailed, he fell asleep. A
wind storm came down on the lake, and they were taking on dangerous
amounts of water. <span class="bibleverse">24</span> They came to him
and awoke him, saying, “Master, Master, we are dying!” He awoke and
rebuked the wind and the raging of the water; then they ceased, and it
was calm.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> <span class="bibleverse">25</span>

<h2 id="jesus-heals-the-possessed-in-the-land-of-the-gergesen">Jesus

<p><span class="bibleverse">26</span> Then they arrived at the country
of the Gadarenes, which is opposite Galilee. <span
class="bibleverse">27</span> When Jesus stepped ashore, a certain man
out of the city who had demons for a long time met him. He wore no
clothes, and didn’t live in a house, but in the tombs. <span
class="bibleverse">28</span> When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell
down before him, and with a loud voice said, “What do I have to do with
you, Jesus, you Son of the Most High God? I beg you, don’t torment me!”
<span class="bibleverse">29</span> For Jesus was commanding the unclean
spirit to come out of the man. For the unclean spirit had often seized
the man. He was kept under guard and bound with chains and fetters.
Breaking the bonds apart, he was driven by the demon into the desert.
<span class="bibleverse">30</span> Jesus asked him, “What is your name?”
He said, “Legion,” for many demons had entered into him. <span
class="bibleverse">31</span> They begged him that he would not command
them to go into the abyss. <span class="bibleverse">32</span> Now there
was there a herd of many pigs feeding on the mountain, and they begged
him that he would allow them to enter into those. Then he allowed them.
<span class="bibleverse">33</span> The demons came out of the man and
entered into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the
lake and were drowned. <span class="bibleverse">34</span> When those who
fed them saw what had happened, they fled and told it in the city and in
the country. <span class="bibleverse">35</span> People went out to see
what had happened. They came to Jesus and found the man from whom the
demons had gone out, sitting at Jesus’ feet, clothed and in his right
mind; and they were afraid. <span class="bibleverse">36</span> Those who
saw it told them how he who had been possessed by demons was healed.
<span class="bibleverse">37</span> All the people of the surrounding
country of the Gadarenes asked him to depart from them, for they were
very much afraid. Then he entered into the boat and returned. <span
class="bibleverse">38</span> But the man from whom the demons had gone
out begged him that he might go with him, but Jesus sent him away,
saying, <span class="bibleverse">39</span> “Return to your house, and
declare what great things God has done for you.” He went his way,
proclaiming throughout the whole city what great things Jesus had done
for him.</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">40</span> When Jesus returned, the multitude
welcomed him, for they were all waiting for him. <span
class="bibleverse">41</span> Behold, a man named Jairus came. He was a
ruler of the synagogue. He fell down at Jesus’ feet and begged him to
come into his house, <span class="bibleverse">42</span> for he had an
only born<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a> daughter, about twelve years of
age, and she was dying. But as he went, the multitudes pressed against
him. <span class="bibleverse">43</span> A woman who had a flow of blood
for twelve years, who had spent all her living on physicians and could
not be healed by any, <span class="bibleverse">44</span> came behind him
and touched the fringe<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a> of his cloak. Immediately the flow
of her blood stopped. <span class="bibleverse">45</span> Jesus said,
“Who touched me?” When all denied it, Peter and those with him said,
“Master, the multitudes press and jostle you, and you say, ‘Who touched
me?’” <span class="bibleverse">46</span> But Jesus said, “Someone did
touch me, for I perceived that power has gone out of me.” <span
class="bibleverse">47</span> When the woman saw that she was not hidden,
she came trembling; and falling down before him declared to him in the
presence of all the people the reason why she had touched him, and how
she was healed immediately. <span class="bibleverse">48</span> He said
to her, “Daughter, cheer up. Your faith has made you well. Go in peace.”
<span class="bibleverse">49</span> While he still spoke, one from the
ruler of the synagogue’s house came, saying to him, “Your daughter is
dead. Don’t trouble the Teacher.” <span class="bibleverse">50</span> But
Jesus hearing it, answered him, “Don’t be afraid. Only believe, and she
will be healed.” <span class="bibleverse">51</span> When he came to the
house, he didn’t allow anyone to enter in, except Peter, John, James,
the father of the child, and her mother. <span
class="bibleverse">52</span> All were weeping and mourning her, but he
said, “Don’t weep. She isn’t dead, but sleeping.” <span
class="bibleverse">53</span> They were ridiculing him, knowing that she
was dead. <span class="bibleverse">54</span> But he put them all
outside, and taking her by the hand, he called, saying, “Child, arise!”
<span class="bibleverse">55</span> Her spirit returned, and she rose up
immediately. He commanded that something be given to her to eat. <span
class="bibleverse">56</span> Her parents were amazed, but he commanded
them to tell no one what had been done.</p>

together and gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure
diseases. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> He sent them out to preach
God’s Kingdom and to heal the sick. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> He
said to them, “Take nothing for your journey—no staffs, nor wallet, nor
bread, nor money. Don’t have two tunics each. <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> Into whatever house you enter, stay there,
and depart from there. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> As many as
don’t receive you, when you depart from that city, shake off even the
dust from your feet for a testimony against them.” <span

Bethsaida. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> But the multitudes,
perceiving it, followed him. He welcomed them, spoke to them of God’s
Kingdom, and he cured those who needed healing. <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> The day began to wear away; and the twelve
came and said to him, “Send the multitude away, that they may go into
the surrounding villages and farms and lodge and get food, for we are
here in a deserted place.” <span class="bibleverse">13</span> But he
said to them, “You give them something to eat.” They said, “We have no
more than five loaves and two fish, unless we should go and buy food for
all these people.” <span class="bibleverse">14</span> For they were
about five thousand men. He said to his disciples, “Make them sit down
in groups of about fifty each.” <span class="bibleverse">15</span> They
did so, and made them all sit down. <span class="bibleverse">16</span>
He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to the sky, he
blessed them, broke them, and gave them to the disciples to set before
the multitude. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> They ate and were all
filled. They gathered up twelve baskets of broken pieces that were left

prophets has risen again.” <span class="bibleverse">20</span> He said to
them, “But who do you say that I am?” Peter answered, “The Christ of

commanded them to tell this to no one, <span

the whole world, and loses or forfeits his own self? <span

and the glory of the Father, and of the holy angels. <span

<p><span class="bibleverse">28</span> About eight days after these

mountain to pray. <span class="bibleverse">29</span> As he was praying,
the appearance of his face was altered, and his clothing became white
and dazzling. <span class="bibleverse">30</span> Behold, two men were

departure,<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"

Jerusalem. <span class="bibleverse">32</span> Now Peter and those who
were with him were heavy with sleep, but when they were fully awake,
they saw his glory, and the two men who stood with him. <span
class="bibleverse">33</span> As they were parting from him, Peter said
to Jesus, “Master, it is good for us to be here. Let’s make three tents:
one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah,” not knowing what he
said. <span class="bibleverse">34</span> While he said these things, a
cloud came and overshadowed them, and they were afraid as they entered
into the cloud. <span class="bibleverse">35</span> A voice came out of
the cloud, saying, “This is my beloved Son. Listen to him!” <span

They were silent, and told no one in those days any of the things which
they had seen.</p>

from him, bruising him severely. <span class="bibleverse">40</span> I
begged your disciples to cast it out, and they couldn’t.” <span
class="bibleverse">41</span> Jesus answered, “Faithless and perverse
generation, how long shall I be with you and bear with you? Bring your
son here.” <span class="bibleverse">42</span> While he was still coming,
the demon threw him down and convulsed him violently. But Jesus rebuked
the unclean spirit, healed the boy, and gave him back to his father.
<span class="bibleverse">43</span> They were all astonished at the
majesty of God. But while all were marvelling at all the things which
Jesus did, he said to his disciples,</p>

and set him by his side, <span class="bibleverse">48</span> and said to
them, “Whoever receives this little child in my name receives me.
Whoever receives me receives him who sent me. For whoever is least
amongst you all, this one will be great.” <span

casting out demons in your name, and we forbade him, because he doesn’t
follow with us.” <span class="bibleverse">50</span> Jesus said to him,

to prepare for him. <span class="bibleverse">53</span> They didn’t
receive him, because he was travelling with his face set towards
Jerusalem. <span class="bibleverse">54</span> When his disciples, James
and John, saw this, they said, “Lord, do you want us to command fire to
come down from the sky and destroy them, just as Elijah did?” <span
class="bibleverse">55</span> But he turned and rebuked them, “You don’t

stripped him and beat him, and departed, leaving him half dead. <span

came where he was. When he saw him, he was moved with compassion, <span

pouring on oil and wine. He set him on his own animal, brought him to an
inn, and took care of him. <span class="bibleverse">35</span> On the
next day, when he departed, he took out two denarii, gave them to the
host, and said to him, ‘Take care of him. Whatever you spend beyond
that, I will repay you when I return.’ <span

prophets, and your fathers killed them. <span
class="bibleverse">48</span> So you testify and consent to the works of
your fathers. For they killed them, and you build their tombs. <span

said, <span class="bibleverse">6</span> “As for these things which you
see, the days will come in which there will not be left here one stone
on another that will not be thrown down.” <span

<p><span class="bibleverse">7</span> The day of unleavened bread came,

said to them, “I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you
before I suffer, <span class="bibleverse">16</span> for I tell you, I
will no longer by any means eat of it until it is fulfilled in God’s
Kingdom.” <span class="bibleverse">17</span> He received a cup, and when
he had given thanks, he said, “Take this and share it amongst
yourselves, <span class="bibleverse">18</span> for I tell you, I will
not drink at all again from the fruit of the vine, until God’s Kingdom
comes.” <span class="bibleverse">19</span> He took bread, and when he
had given thanks, he broke and gave it to them, saying, “This is my body
which is given for you. Do this in memory of me.” <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> Likewise, he took the cup after supper,
saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out
for you. <span class="bibleverse">21</span> But behold, the hand of him
who betrays me is with me on the table. <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> The Son of Man indeed goes as it has been

<h2 id="farewell-words-to-the-disciples">Farewell words to the

<p><span class="bibleverse">24</span> A dispute also arose amongst them,

lord it over them, and those who have authority over them are called
‘benefactors.’ <span class="bibleverse">26</span> But not so with you.
Rather, the one who is greater amongst you, let him become as the
younger, and one who is governing, as one who serves. <span

“Nothing.” <span class="bibleverse">36</span> Then he said to them, “But

has none, let him sell his cloak, and buy a sword. <span

them, “Pray that you don’t enter into temptation.” <span
class="bibleverse">41</span> He was withdrawn from them about a stone’s
throw, and he knelt down and prayed, <span class="bibleverse">42</span>
saying, “Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me.
Nevertheless, not my will, but yours, be done.” <span
class="bibleverse">43</span> An angel from heaven appeared to him,
strengthening him. <span class="bibleverse">44</span> Being in agony, he
prayed more earnestly. His sweat became like great drops of blood
falling down on the ground. <span class="bibleverse">45</span> When he
rose up from his prayer, he came to the disciples and found them
sleeping because of grief, <span class="bibleverse">46</span> and said

temptation.”</p>
<h2 id="capture-of-jesus">Capture of Jesus</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">47</span> While he was still speaking, a
crowd appeared. He who was called Judas, one of the twelve, was leading

betray the Son of Man with a kiss?” <span class="bibleverse">49</span>
When those who were around him saw what was about to happen, they said
to him, “Lord, shall we strike with the sword?” <span
class="bibleverse">50</span> A certain one of them struck the servant of
the high priest, and cut off his right ear. <span
class="bibleverse">51</span> But Jesus answered, “Let me at least do
this”—and he touched his ear and healed him. <span
class="bibleverse">52</span> Jesus said to the chief priests, captains
of the temple, and elders, who had come against him, “Have you come out
as against a robber, with swords and clubs? <span

distance. <span class="bibleverse">55</span> When they had kindled a
fire in the middle of the courtyard and had sat down together, Peter sat
amongst them. <span class="bibleverse">56</span> A certain servant girl
saw him as he sat in the light, and looking intently at him, said, “This
man also was with him.” <span class="bibleverse">57</span> He denied
Jesus, saying, “Woman, I don’t know him.” <span
class="bibleverse">58</span> After a little while someone else saw him
and said, “You also are one of them!” But Peter answered, “Man, I am
not!” <span class="bibleverse">59</span> After about one hour passed,
another confidently affirmed, saying, “Truly this man also was with him,
for he is a Galilean!” <span class="bibleverse">60</span> But Peter
said, “Man, I don’t know what you are talking about!” Immediately, while
he was still speaking, a rooster crowed. <span
class="bibleverse">61</span> The Lord turned and looked at Peter. Then
Peter remembered the Lord’s word, how he said to him, “Before the
rooster crows you will deny me three times.” <span

they struck him on the face and asked him, “Prophesy! Who is the one who
struck you?” <span class="bibleverse">65</span> They spoke many other
things against him, insulting him. <span class="bibleverse">66</span> As
soon as it was day, the assembly of the elders of the people were
gathered together, both chief priests and scribes, and they led him away
into their council, saying, <span class="bibleverse">67</span> “If you
are the Christ, tell us.” But he said to them, “If I tell you, you won’t
believe, <span class="bibleverse">68</span> and if I ask, you will in no
way answer me or let me go. <span class="bibleverse">69</span> From now
on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of
God.” <span class="bibleverse">70</span> They all said, “Are you then

<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> The whole company of them rose up
and brought him before Pilate. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> They
began to accuse him, saying, “We found this man perverting the nation,
forbidding paying taxes to Caesar, and saying that he himself is Christ,
a king.” <span class="bibleverse">3</span> Pilate asked him, “Are you
the King of the Jews?” He answered him, “So you say.” <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> Pilate said to the chief priests and the
multitudes, “I find no basis for a charge against this man.” <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> But they insisted, saying, “He stirs up the
people, teaching throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee even to
this place.” <span class="bibleverse">6</span> But when Pilate heard
Galilee mentioned, he asked if the man was a Galilean. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> When he found out that he was in Herod’s
jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem during
those days.</p>
<h2 id="jesus-before-herod">Jesus before Herod</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">8</span> Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was
exceedingly glad, for he had wanted to see him for a long time, because
he had heard many things about him. He hoped to see some miracle done by
him. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> He questioned him with many
words, but he gave no answers. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> The
chief priests and the scribes stood, vehemently accusing him. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> Herod with his soldiers humiliated him and
mocked him. Dressing him in luxurious clothing, they sent him back to
Pilate. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> Herod and Pilate became
friends with each other that very day, for before that they were enemies
with each other.</p>
<h2 id="jesus-again-before-pilate">Jesus again before Pilate</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">13</span> Pilate called together the chief

people, and behold, having examined him before you, I found no basis for
a charge against this man concerning those things of which you accuse
him. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> Neither has Herod, for I sent
you to him, and see, nothing worthy of death has been done by him. <span

him.”</p>

into prison for a certain revolt in the city, and for murder. <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> Then Pilate spoke to them again, wanting to
release Jesus, <span class="bibleverse">21</span> but they shouted,
saying, “Crucify! Crucify him!” <span class="bibleverse">22</span> He
said to them the third time, “Why? What evil has this man done? I have
found no capital crime in him. I will therefore chastise him and release
him.” <span class="bibleverse">23</span> But they were urgent with loud
voices, asking that he might be crucified. Their voices and the voices
of the chief priests prevailed. <span class="bibleverse">24</span>
Pilate decreed that what they asked for should be done. <span

prison for insurrection and murder, for whom they asked, but he
delivered Jesus up to their will.</p>

on him to carry it after Jesus. <span class="bibleverse">27</span> A
great multitude of the people followed him, including women who also
mourned and lamented him. <span class="bibleverse">28</span> But Jesus,
turning to them, said, “Daughters of Jerusalem, don’t weep for me, but
weep for yourselves and for your children. <span
class="bibleverse">29</span> For behold, the days are coming in which
they will say, ‘Blessed are the barren, the wombs that never bore, and
the breasts that never nursed.’ <span class="bibleverse">30</span> Then

criminals, led with him to be put to death. <span
class="bibleverse">33</span> When they came to the place that is called
“The Skull”, they crucified him there with the criminals, one on the
right and the other on the left. <span class="bibleverse">34</span>
Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, for they don’t know what they are
doing.” Dividing his garments amongst them, they cast lots. <span
class="bibleverse">35</span> The people stood watching. The rulers with
them also scoffed at him, saying, “He saved others. Let him save
himself, if this is the Christ of God, his chosen one!” <span
class="bibleverse">36</span> The soldiers also mocked him, coming to him
and offering him vinegar, <span class="bibleverse">37</span> and saying,
“If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!” <span

rebuking him said, “Don’t you even fear God, seeing you are under the
same condemnation? <span class="bibleverse">41</span> And we indeed
justly, for we receive the due reward for our deeds, but this man has
done nothing wrong.” <span class="bibleverse">42</span> He said to
Jesus, “Lord, remember me when you come into your Kingdom.” <span

Galilee, <span class="bibleverse">7</span> saying that the Son of Man
must be delivered up into the hands of sinful men and be crucified, and
the third day rise again?” <span class="bibleverse">8</span> They
remembered his words, <span class="bibleverse">9</span> returned from
the tomb, and told all these things to the eleven and to all the rest.
<span class="bibleverse">10</span> Now they were Mary Magdalene, Joanna,
and Mary the mother of James. The other women with them told these
things to the apostles. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> These words
seemed to them to be nonsense, and they didn’t believe them. <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> But Peter got up and ran to the tomb.
Stooping and looking in, he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves,
and he departed to his home, wondering what had happened.</p>
<h2 id="the-disciples-of-emmaus">The disciples of Emmaus</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">13</span> Behold, two of them were going
that very day to a village named Emmaus, which was sixty stadia<a
href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>51</sup></a> from Jerusalem. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> They talked with each other about all of
these things which had happened. <span class="bibleverse">15</span>
While they talked and questioned together, Jesus himself came near, and
went with them. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> But their eyes were
kept from recognising him. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> He said to
them, “What are you talking about as you walk, and are sad?” <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> One of them, named Cleopas, answered him,
“Are you the only stranger in Jerusalem who doesn’t know the things
which have happened there in these days?” <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> He said to them, “What things?” They said
to him, “The things concerning Jesus the Nazarene, who was a prophet
mighty in deed and word before God and all the people; <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> and how the chief priests and our rulers
delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him. <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> But we were hoping that it was he who would
redeem Israel. Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since
these things happened. <span class="bibleverse">22</span> Also, certain
women of our company amazed us, having arrived early at the tomb; <span
class="bibleverse">23</span> and when they didn’t find his body, they
came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels, who said that he
was alive. <span class="bibleverse">24</span> Some of us went to the
tomb and found it just like the women had said, but they didn’t see
him.” <span class="bibleverse">25</span> He said to them, “Foolish
people, and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have
spoken! <span class="bibleverse">26</span> Didn’t the Christ have to
suffer these things and to enter into his glory?” <span
class="bibleverse">27</span> Beginning from Moses and from all the
prophets, he explained to them in all the Scriptures the things
concerning himself. <span class="bibleverse">28</span> They came near to
the village where they were going, and he acted like he would go
further. <span class="bibleverse">29</span> They urged him, saying,
“Stay with us, for it is almost evening, and the day is almost over.” He
went in to stay with them. <span class="bibleverse">30</span> When he
had sat down at the table with them, he took the bread and gave thanks.
Breaking it, he gave it to them. <span class="bibleverse">31</span>
Their eyes were opened and they recognised him; then he vanished out of
their sight. <span class="bibleverse">32</span> They said to one
another, “Weren’t our hearts burning within us while he spoke to us
along the way, and while he opened the Scriptures to us?” <span
class="bibleverse">33</span> They rose up that very hour, returned to
Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and those who were
with them, <span class="bibleverse">34</span> saying, “The Lord is risen
indeed, and has appeared to Simon!” <span class="bibleverse">35</span>
They related the things that happened along the way, and how he was
recognised by them in the breaking of the bread.</p>

appeared to the circle of disciples on Easter Sunday night; his
missionary mandate and farewell to the disciples</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">36</span> As they said these things, Jesus
himself stood amongst them, and said to them, “Peace be to you.” <span
class="bibleverse">37</span> But they were terrified and filled with
fear, and supposed that they had seen a spirit. <span
class="bibleverse">38</span> He said to them, “Why are you troubled? Why
do doubts arise in your hearts? <span class="bibleverse">39</span> See
my hands and my feet, that it is truly me. Touch me and see, for a
spirit doesn’t have flesh and bones, as you see that I have.” <span
class="bibleverse">40</span> When he had said this, he showed them his
hands and his feet. <span class="bibleverse">41</span> While they still
didn’t believe for joy, and wondered, he said to them, “Do you have
anything here to eat?” <span class="bibleverse">42</span> They gave him
a piece of a broiled fish and some honeycomb. <span
class="bibleverse">43</span> He took them, and ate in front of them.
<span class="bibleverse">44</span> He said to them, “This is what I told
you while I was still with you, that all things which are written in the
law of Moses, the prophets, and the psalms concerning me must be
fulfilled.” <span class="bibleverse">45</span> Then he opened their
minds, that they might understand the Scriptures. <span
class="bibleverse">46</span> He said to them, “Thus it is written, and
thus it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead
the third day, <span class="bibleverse">47</span> and that repentance
and remission of sins should be preached in his name to all the nations,
beginning at Jerusalem. <span class="bibleverse">48</span> You are
witnesses of these things. <span class="bibleverse">49</span> Behold, I
send out the promise of my Father on you. But wait in the city of
Jerusalem until you are clothed with power from on high.”</p>
<h2 id="ascension-of-jesus">Ascension of Jesus</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">50</span> He led them out as far as Bethany,
and he lifted up his hands and blessed them. <span
class="bibleverse">51</span> While he blessed them, he withdrew from
them and was carried up into heaven. <span class="bibleverse">52</span>
They worshipped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy, <span
class="bibleverse">53</span> and were continually in the temple,
praising and blessing God. Amen.</p>
