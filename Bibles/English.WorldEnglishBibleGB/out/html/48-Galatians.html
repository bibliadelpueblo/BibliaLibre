<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Paul, an apostle—not from men, nor
through man, but through Jesus Christ,<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> and
God the Father, who raised him from the dead— <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> and all the brothers<a href="#fn2"

are with me, to the assemblies of Galatia: <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> Grace to you and peace from God the Father
and our Lord Jesus Christ, <span class="bibleverse">4</span> who gave
himself for our sins, that he might deliver us out of this present evil
age, according to the will of our God and Father— <span

Amen.</p>

apostle's surprise at the rapid apostasy of the Galatians from the only
true message of salvation</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">6</span> I marvel that you are so quickly
deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ to a different “good
news”, <span class="bibleverse">7</span> but there isn’t another “good
news.” Only there are some who trouble you and want to pervert the Good
News of Christ. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> But even though we, or
an angel from heaven, should preach to you any “good news” other than
that which we preached to you, let him be cursed. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> As we have said before, so I now say again:
if any man preaches to you any “good news” other than that which you
received, let him be cursed. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> For am I
now seeking the favour of men, or of God? Or am I striving to please
men? For if I were still pleasing men, I wouldn’t be a servant of
Christ.</p>
<h2
id="establishing-the-claim-that-pauls-message-of-salvation-came-from-god">Establishing
the claim that Paul's message of salvation came from God</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">11</span> But I make known to you, brothers,
concerning the Good News which was preached by me, that it is not
according to man. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> For I didn’t
receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but it came to me through
revelation of Jesus Christ.</p>
<h2
id="pauls-behavior-before-his-conversion-and-immediately-after">Paul's
behavior before his conversion and immediately after</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">13</span> For you have heard of my way of
living in time past in the Jews’ religion, how that beyond measure I
persecuted the assembly of God and ravaged it. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> I advanced in the Jews’ religion beyond
many of my own age amongst my countrymen, being more exceedingly zealous
for the traditions of my fathers. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> But
when it was the good pleasure of God, who separated me from my mother’s
womb and called me through his grace, <span class="bibleverse">16</span>
to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him amongst the Gentiles, I
didn’t immediately confer with flesh and blood, <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who
were apostles before me, but I went away into Arabia. Then I returned to
Damascus.</p>
<h2
id="the-independent-activity-of-paul-during-the-time-before-the-meeting-of-the-apostles">The
independent activity of Paul during the time before the meeting of the
apostles</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">18</span> Then after three years I went up
to Jerusalem to visit Peter, and stayed with him fifteen days. <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> But of the other apostles I saw no one
except James, the Lord’s brother. <span class="bibleverse">20</span> Now
about the things which I write to you, behold,<a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>
before God, I’m not lying. <span class="bibleverse">21</span> Then I
came to the regions of Syria and Cilicia. <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> I was still unknown by face to the
assemblies of Judea which were in Christ, <span
class="bibleverse">23</span> but they only heard, “He who once
persecuted us now preaches the faith that he once tried to destroy.”
<span class="bibleverse">24</span> So they glorified God in me.</p>
<h1 id="section-1">2</h1>
<h2
id="appearance-of-paul-at-the-apostles-consultation-in-jerusalem">Appearance
of Paul at the apostle's consultation in Jerusalem</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Then after a period of fourteen
years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus also with
me. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> I went up by revelation, and I
laid before them the Good News which I preach amongst the Gentiles, but
privately before those who were respected, for fear that I might be
running, or had run, in vain. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> But not
even Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be
circumcised. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> This was because of the
false brothers secretly brought in, who stole in to spy out our liberty
which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage,
<span class="bibleverse">5</span> to whom we gave no place in the way of
subjection, not for an hour, that the truth of the Good News might
continue with you.</p>
<h2
id="the-favorable-outcome-for-paul-of-the-negotiations-with-the-chief-apostles-respected">The
favorable outcome for Paul of the negotiations with the chief apostles,
respected</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">6</span> But from those who were reputed to
be important—whatever they were, it makes no difference to me; God
doesn’t show partiality to man—they, I say, who were respected imparted
nothing to me, <span class="bibleverse">7</span> but to the contrary,
when they saw that I had been entrusted with the Good News for the
uncircumcised, even as Peter with the Good News for the circumcised—
<span class="bibleverse">8</span> for he who worked through Peter in the
apostleship with the circumcised also worked through me with the
Gentiles— <span class="bibleverse">9</span> and when they perceived the
grace that was given to me, James and Cephas and John, those who were
reputed to be pillars, gave to Barnabas and me the right hand of
fellowship, that we should go to the Gentiles, and they to the
circumcision. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> They only asked us to
remember the poor—which very thing I was also zealous to do.</p>
<h2 id="pauls-justified-appearance-against-peter-in-antioch">Paul's
justified appearance against Peter in Antioch</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">11</span> But when Peter came to Antioch, I
resisted him to his face, because he stood condemned. <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> For before some people came from James, he
ate with the Gentiles. But when they came, he drew back and separated
himself, fearing those who were of the circumcision. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> And the rest of the Jews joined him in his
hypocrisy, so that even Barnabas was carried away with their
hypocrisy.</p>
<h2 id="pauls-rebuke-speech-against-peter">Paul's rebuke speech against
Peter</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">14</span> But when I saw that they didn’t
walk uprightly according to the truth of the Good News, I said to Peter
before them all, “If you, being a Jew, live as the Gentiles do, and not
as the Jews do, why do you compel the Gentiles to live as the Jews do?
<span class="bibleverse">15</span> “We, being Jews by nature and not
Gentile sinners, <span class="bibleverse">16</span> yet knowing that a
man is not justified by the works of the law but through faith in Jesus
Christ, even we believed in Christ Jesus, that we might be justified by
faith in Christ and not by the works of the law, because no flesh will
be justified by the works of the law. <span class="bibleverse">17</span>
But if while we sought to be justified in Christ, we ourselves also were
found sinners, is Christ a servant of sin? Certainly not! <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> For if I build up again those things which
I destroyed, I prove myself a law-breaker. <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> For I through the law died to the law, that
I might live to God. <span class="bibleverse">20</span> I have been
crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives
in me. That life which I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the
Son of God, who loved me and gave himself up for me. <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> I don’t reject the grace of God. For if
righteousness is through the law, then Christ died for nothing!”</p>
<h1 id="section-2">3</h1>
<h2
id="reference-to-the-experience-of-the-galatians-themselves-that-the-reception-of-the-spirit-is-the-result-of-faith">Reference
to the experience of the Galatians themselves that the reception of the
Spirit is the result of faith</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Foolish Galatians, who has
bewitched you not to obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was
openly portrayed amongst you as crucified? <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> I just want to learn this from you: Did you
receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by hearing of faith?
<span class="bibleverse">3</span> Are you so foolish? Having begun in
the Spirit, are you now completed in the flesh? <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> Did you suffer so many things in vain, if it
is indeed in vain? <span class="bibleverse">5</span> He therefore who
supplies the Spirit to you and does miracles amongst you, does he do it
by the works of the law, or by hearing of faith?</p>
<h2
id="the-righteousness-of-abrahams-faith-our-example-the-service-of-the-law-brings-the-curse-christ-frees-from-the-curse-of-the-law">The
righteousness of Abraham's faith our example; the service of the law
brings the curse, Christ frees from the curse of the law</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">6</span> Even so, Abraham “believed God, and
it was counted to him for righteousness.”<a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>
<span class="bibleverse">7</span> Know therefore that those who are of
faith are children of Abraham. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> The
Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith,
preached the Good News beforehand to Abraham, saying, “In you all the
nations will be blessed.”<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> <span class="bibleverse">9</span> So
then, those who are of faith are blessed with the faithful Abraham.
<span class="bibleverse">10</span> For as many as are of the works of
the law are under a curse. For it is written, “Cursed is everyone who
doesn’t continue in all things that are written in the book of the law,
to do them.”<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> <span class="bibleverse">11</span>
Now that no man is justified by the law before God is evident, for, “The
righteous will live by faith.”<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> The law is not of faith, but, “The man who
does them will live by them.”<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> Christ redeemed us from the curse of the
law, having become a curse for us. For it is written, “Cursed is
everyone who hangs on a tree,”<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> that the blessing of Abraham might come on
the Gentiles through Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of
the Spirit through faith.</p>
<h2
id="the-promise-made-to-abraham-is-not-canceled-by-the-law-given-later">The
promise made to Abraham is not canceled by the law given later</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">15</span> Brothers, speaking of human terms,
though it is only a man’s covenant, yet when it has been confirmed, no
one makes it void or adds to it. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> Now
the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his offspring.<a href="#fn10"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>
He doesn’t say, “To descendants<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> ”, as of many, but as
of one, “To your offspring”,<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> which is Christ. <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> Now I say this: A covenant confirmed
beforehand by God in Christ, the law, which came four hundred and thirty
years after, does not annul, so as to make the promise of no effect.
<span class="bibleverse">18</span> For if the inheritance is of the law,
it is no more of promise; but God has granted it to Abraham by
promise.</p>
<h2
id="nature-and-purpose-of-the-law-that-is-ineffective-for-the-perfection-of-salvation-ordained-by-angels-and-a-mediator-and-intended-only-for-the-meantime">Nature
and purpose of the law that is ineffective for the perfection of
salvation, ordained by angels and a mediator and intended only for the
meantime</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">19</span> Then why is there the law? It was
added because of transgressions, until the offspring should come to whom
the promise has been made. It was ordained through angels by the hand of
a mediator. <span class="bibleverse">20</span> Now a mediator is not
between one, but God is one.</p>
<h2 id="rejection-of-possible-misinterpretation">Rejection of possible
misinterpretation</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">21</span> Is the law then against the
promises of God? Certainly not! For if there had been a law given which
could make alive, most certainly righteousness would have been of the
law. <span class="bibleverse">22</span> But the Scripture imprisoned all
things under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be
given to those who believe.</p>
<h2 id="the-external-educational-purpose-of-the-law">The external
educational purpose of the law</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">23</span> But before faith came, we were
kept in custody under the law, confined for the faith which should
afterwards be revealed. <span class="bibleverse">24</span> So that the
law has become our tutor to bring us to Christ, that we might be
justified by faith.</p>
<h2
id="all-christian-believers-are-now-after-the-end-of-the-rule-of-law-of-god-and-of-the-children-and-heirs-of-abraham">All
Christian believers are now, after the end of the rule of law, of God
and of the children and heirs of Abraham</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">25</span> But now that faith has come, we
are no longer under a tutor. <span class="bibleverse">26</span> For you
are all children of God, through faith in Christ Jesus. <span
class="bibleverse">27</span> For as many of you as were baptised into
Christ have put on Christ. <span class="bibleverse">28</span> There is
neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free man, there is
neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus. <span
class="bibleverse">29</span> If you are Christ’s, then you are Abraham’s
offspring and heirs according to promise.</p>
<h1 id="section-3">4</h1>
<h2
id="for-believers-the-position-of-sonship-sonship-in-christ-has-taken-the-place-of-slavery-to-the-law">For
believers, the position of sonship, sonship, in Christ has taken the
place of slavery to the law</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> But I say that so long as the heir
is a child, he is no different from a bondservant, though he is lord of
all, <span class="bibleverse">2</span> but is under guardians and
stewards until the day appointed by the father. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> So we also, when we were children, were held
in bondage under the elemental principles of the world. <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> But when the fullness of the time came, God
sent out his Son, born to a woman, born under the law, <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> that he might redeem those who were under
the law, that we might receive the adoption as children. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> And because you are children, God sent out
the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, “Abba,<a href="#fn13"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a>
Father!” <span class="bibleverse">7</span> So you are no longer a
bondservant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through
Christ.</p>

apostle's complaint about the incomprehensible relapse of the believing
Galatians into the slavery of the law and reprehensible formalism;
personal call to the church to repent</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">8</span> However at that time, not knowing
God, you were in bondage to those who by nature are not gods. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> But now that you have come to know God, or
rather to be known by God, why do you turn back again to the weak and
miserable elemental principles, to which you desire to be in bondage all
over again? <span class="bibleverse">10</span> You observe days, months,
seasons, and years. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> I am afraid for
you, that I might have wasted my labour for you. <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> I beg you, brothers, become as I am, for I
also have become as you are. You did me no wrong, <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> but you know that because of weakness in
the flesh I preached the Good News to you the first time. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> That which was a temptation to you in my
flesh, you didn’t despise nor reject; but you received me as an angel of
God, even as Christ Jesus. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> What was
the blessing you enjoyed? For I testify to you that, if possible, you
would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me. <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> So then, have I become your enemy by
telling you the truth? <span class="bibleverse">17</span> They zealously
seek you in no good way. No, they desire to alienate you, that you may
seek them. <span class="bibleverse">18</span> But it is always good to
be zealous in a good cause, and not only when I am present with you.
<span class="bibleverse">19</span> My little children, of whom I am
again in travail until Christ is formed in you— <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> but I could wish to be present with you
now, and to change my tone, for I am perplexed about you.</p>

interpretation of the Old Testament account of Ishmael and Isaac, the
two sons of Abraham, as evidence of the Christian's freedom from the
statutes of the law</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">21</span> Tell me, you that desire to be
under the law, don’t you listen to the law? <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> For it is written that Abraham had two
sons, one by the servant, and one by the free woman. <span
class="bibleverse">23</span> However, the son by the servant was born
according to the flesh, but the son by the free woman was born through
promise. <span class="bibleverse">24</span> These things contain an
allegory, for these are two covenants. One is from Mount Sinai, bearing
children to bondage, which is Hagar. <span class="bibleverse">25</span>
For this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and answers to the Jerusalem
that exists now, for she is in bondage with her children. <span
class="bibleverse">26</span> But the Jerusalem that is above is free,
which is the mother of us all. <span class="bibleverse">27</span> For it
is written, “Rejoice, you barren who don’t bear. Break out and shout,
you who don’t travail. For the desolate women have more children than
her who has a husband.” <a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> <span
class="bibleverse">28</span> Now we, brothers, as Isaac was, are
children of promise. <span class="bibleverse">29</span> But as then, he
who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born
according to the Spirit, so also it is now. <span
class="bibleverse">30</span> However, what does the Scripture say?
“Throw out the servant and her son, for the son of the servant will not
inherit with the son of the free woman.”<a href="#fn15"

of what has been said so far and a final warning to cling to Christian
freedom, which is incompatible with the law and circumcision</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">31</span> So then, brothers, we are not
children of a servant, but of the free woman.</p>
<h1 id="section-4">5</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Stand firm therefore in the liberty
by which Christ has made us free, and don’t be entangled again with a
yoke of bondage. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> Behold, I, Paul, tell
you that if you receive circumcision, Christ will profit you nothing.
<span class="bibleverse">3</span> Yes, I testify again to every man who
receives circumcision that he is a debtor to do the whole law. <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> You are alienated from Christ, you who
desire to be justified by the law. You have fallen away from grace.
<span class="bibleverse">5</span> For we through the Spirit, by faith
wait for the hope of righteousness. <span class="bibleverse">6</span>
For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision amounts to
anything, but faith working through love.</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">7</span> You were running well! Who

you. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> A little yeast grows through the
whole lump. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> I have confidence towards
you in the Lord that you will think no other way. But he who troubles
you will bear his judgement, whoever he is. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> But I, brothers, if I still preach
circumcision, why am I still persecuted? Then the stumbling block of the
cross has been removed. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> I wish that

<p><span class="bibleverse">13</span> For you, brothers, were called for
freedom. Only don’t use your freedom an an opportunity for the flesh,
but through love be servants to one another. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> For the whole law is fulfilled in one word,
in this: “You shall love your neighbour as yourself.”<a href="#fn16"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a>

in the Spirit! The works of the flesh and the fruit of the spirit</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">16</span> But I say, walk by the Spirit, and
you won’t fulfil the lust of the flesh. <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and
the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary to one another,
that you may not do the things that you desire. <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> But if you are led by the Spirit, you are
not under the law. <span class="bibleverse">19</span> Now the deeds of
the flesh are obvious, which are: adultery, sexual immorality,
uncleanness, lustfulness, <span class="bibleverse">20</span> idolatry,
sorcery, hatred, strife, jealousies, outbursts of anger, rivalries,
divisions, heresies, <span class="bibleverse">21</span> envy, murders,
drunkenness, orgies, and things like these; of which I forewarn you,
even as I also forewarned you, that those who practise such things will
not inherit God’s Kingdom. <span class="bibleverse">22</span> But the
fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness,
faith,<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> <span class="bibleverse">23</span>

also walk by the Spirit. <span class="bibleverse">26</span> Let’s not
become conceited, provoking one another, and envying one another.</p>
<h1 id="section-5">6</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Brothers, even if a man is caught
in some fault, you who are spiritual must restore such a one in a spirit
of gentleness, looking to yourself so that you also aren’t tempted.
<span class="bibleverse">2</span> Bear one another’s burdens, and so
fulfil the law of Christ. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> For if a man
thinks himself to be something when he is nothing, he deceives himself.
<span class="bibleverse">4</span> But let each man examine his own work,
and then he will have reason to boast in himself, and not in someone
else. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> For each man will bear his own
burden. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> But let him who is taught in
the word share all good things with him who teaches. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> Don’t be deceived. God is not mocked, for
whatever a man sows, that he will also reap. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> For he who sows to his own flesh will from
the flesh reap corruption. But he who sows to the Spirit will from the
Spirit reap eternal life. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> Let’s not be
weary in doing good, for we will reap in due season if we don’t give up.
<span class="bibleverse">10</span> So then, as we have opportunity,
let’s do what is good towards all men, and especially towards those who
are of the household of the faith.</p>

<span class="bibleverse">13</span> For even they who receive
circumcision don’t keep the law themselves, but they desire to have you
circumcised, so that they may boast in your flesh.</p>
<h2 id="personal-final-confession-blessing">Personal Final Confession;
Blessing</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">14</span> But far be it from me to boast
except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world
has been crucified to me, and I to the world. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> For in Christ Jesus neither is circumcision
anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation. <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> As many as walk by this rule, peace and
mercy be on them, and on God’s Israel. <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> From now on, let no one cause me any
trouble, for I bear the marks of the Lord Jesus branded on my body.
<span class="bibleverse">18</span> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be
with your spirit, brothers. Amen.</p>
