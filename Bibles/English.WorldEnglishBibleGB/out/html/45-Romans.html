<p><span class="bibleverse">8</span> First, I thank my God through Jesus
Christ for all of you, that your faith is proclaimed throughout the

<span class="bibleverse">13</span> Now I don’t desire to have you

<h2 id="indication-of-the-topic-the-justification">Indication of the

<p><span class="bibleverse">16</span> For I am not ashamed of the Good
News of Christ, because it is the power of God for salvation for
everyone who believes, for the Jew first, and also for the Greek. <span

<p><span class="bibleverse">18</span> For the wrath of God is revealed
from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who
suppress the truth in unrighteousness, <span

revealed in them, for God revealed it to them. <span

creation of the world are clearly seen, being perceived through the
things that are made, even his everlasting power and divinity, that they
may be without excuse. <span class="bibleverse">21</span> Because
knowing God, they didn’t glorify him as God, and didn’t give thanks, but
became vain in their reasoning, and their senseless heart was darkened.

<p><span class="bibleverse">24</span> Therefore God also gave them up in
the lusts of their hearts to uncleanness, that their bodies should be
dishonoured amongst themselves; <span class="bibleverse">25</span> who
exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshipped and served the
creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.</p>

of the real existence of the Christian community called by God in

<p><span class="bibleverse">26</span> For this reason, God gave them up
to vile passions. For their women changed the natural function into that
which is against nature. <span class="bibleverse">27</span> Likewise
also the men, leaving the natural function of the woman, burnt in their
lust towards one another, men doing what is inappropriate with men, and
receiving in themselves the due penalty of their error. <span
class="bibleverse">28</span> Even as they refused to have God in their
knowledge, God gave them up to a reprobate mind, to do those things
which are not fitting; <span class="bibleverse">29</span> being filled
with all unrighteousness, sexual immorality, wickedness, covetousness,
malice; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, evil habits, secret
slanderers, <span class="bibleverse">30</span> backbiters, hateful to
God, insolent, arrogant, boastful, inventors of evil things, disobedient
to parents, <span class="bibleverse">31</span> without understanding,
covenant breakers, without natural affection, unforgiving, unmerciful;

condemn yourself. For you who judge practise the same things. <span

according to truth against those who practise such things. <span

<p><span class="bibleverse">12</span> For as many as have sinned without
the law will also perish without the law. As many as have sinned under
the law will be judged by the law. <span class="bibleverse">13</span>
For it isn’t the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but
the doers of the law will be justified <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> (for when Gentiles who don’t have the law
do by nature the things of the law, these, not having the law, are a law
to themselves, <span class="bibleverse">15</span> in that they show the
work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience testifying

<p><span class="bibleverse">17</span> Indeed you bear the name of a Jew,
rest on the law, glory in God, <span class="bibleverse">18</span> know
his will, and approve the things that are excellent, being instructed
out of the law, <span class="bibleverse">19</span> and are confident
that you yourself are a guide of the blind, a light to those who are in
darkness, <span class="bibleverse">20</span> a corrector of the foolish,
a teacher of babies, having in the law the form of knowledge and of the
truth. <span class="bibleverse">21</span> You therefore who teach

has no value for the Jew if it breaks the law; Circumcision of the
“heart” is necessary</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">25</span> For circumcision indeed profits,
if you are a doer of the law, but if you are a transgressor of the law,
your circumcision has become uncircumcision. <span
class="bibleverse">26</span> If therefore the uncircumcised keep the
ordinances of the law, won’t his uncircumcision be accounted as
circumcision? <span class="bibleverse">27</span> Won’t those who are
physically uncircumcised, but fulfil the law, judge you, who with the
letter and circumcision are a transgressor of the law? <span
class="bibleverse">28</span> For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly,
neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh; <span
class="bibleverse">29</span> but he is a Jew who is one inwardly, and
circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, not in the letter;
whose praise is not from men, but from God.</p>

For if by the trespass of the one the many died, much more did the grace
of God and the gift by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, abound to
the many. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> The gift is not as through
one who sinned; for the judgement came by one to condemnation, but the
free gift followed many trespasses to justification. <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> For if by the trespass of the one, death
reigned through the one; so much more will those who receive the
abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life
through the one, Jesus Christ. <span class="bibleverse">18</span> So
then as through one trespass, all men were condemned; even so through
one act of righteousness, all men were justified to life. <span

many were made sinners, even so through the obedience of the one, many
will be made righteous. <span class="bibleverse">20</span> The law came
in that the trespass might abound; but where sin abounded, grace
abounded more exceedingly, <span class="bibleverse">21</span> that as
sin reigned in death, even so grace might reign through righteousness to
eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>

to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.<a href="#fn21"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a>
<span class="bibleverse">2</span> For the law of the Spirit of life in

class="bibleverse">3</span> For what the law couldn’t do, in that it was
weak through the flesh, God did, sending his own Son in the likeness of
sinful flesh and for sin, he condemned sin in the flesh, <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> that the ordinance of the law might be
fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.
<span class="bibleverse">5</span> For those who live according to the
flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live
according to the Spirit, the things of the Spirit. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> For the mind of the flesh is death, but the
mind of the Spirit is life and peace; <span class="bibleverse">7</span>
because the mind of the flesh is hostile towards God, for it is not
subject to God’s law, neither indeed can it be. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> Those who are in the flesh can’t please God.
<span class="bibleverse">9</span> But you are not in the flesh but in
the Spirit, if it is so that the Spirit of God dwells in you. But if any
man doesn’t have the Spirit of Christ, he is not his. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> If Christ is in you, the body is dead
because of sin, but the spirit is alive because of righteousness. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> But if the Spirit of him who raised up
Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised up Christ Jesus from
the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit
who dwells in you. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> So then, brothers,
we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> For if you live after the flesh, you must
die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you
will live. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> For as many as are led by
the Spirit of God, these are children of God. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> For you didn’t receive the spirit of
bondage again to fear, but you received the Spirit of adoption, by whom
we cry, “Abba!<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> Father!” <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> The Spirit himself testifies with our
spirit that we are children of God; <span class="bibleverse">17</span>
and if children, then heirs—heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ, if
indeed we suffer with him, that we may also be glorified with him. <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> For I consider that the sufferings of this
present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which will be
revealed towards us. <span class="bibleverse">19</span> For the creation
waits with eager expectation for the children of God to be revealed.
<span class="bibleverse">20</span> For the creation was subjected to
vanity, not of its own will, but because of him who subjected it, in
hope <span class="bibleverse">21</span> that the creation itself also
will be delivered from the bondage of decay into the liberty of the
glory of the children of God. <span class="bibleverse">22</span> For we
know that the whole creation groans and travails in pain together until
now. <span class="bibleverse">23</span> Not only so, but ourselves also,
who have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within
ourselves, waiting for adoption, the redemption of our body. <span
class="bibleverse">24</span> For we were saved in hope, but hope that is
seen is not hope. For who hopes for that which he sees? <span
class="bibleverse">25</span> But if we hope for that which we don’t see,
we wait for it with patience. <span class="bibleverse">26</span> In the
same way, the Spirit also helps our weaknesses, for we don’t know how to
pray as we ought. But the Spirit himself makes intercession for us with
groanings which can’t be uttered. <span class="bibleverse">27</span> He
who searches the hearts knows what is on the Spirit’s mind, because he
makes intercession for the saints according to God. <span
class="bibleverse">28</span> We know that all things work together for
good for those who love God, for those who are called according to his
purpose. <span class="bibleverse">29</span> For whom he foreknew, he
also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might
be the firstborn amongst many brothers.<a href="#fn23"

<span class="bibleverse">30</span> Whom he predestined, those he also

those he also glorified. <span class="bibleverse">31</span> What then
shall we say about these things? If God is for us, who can be against
us? <span class="bibleverse">32</span> He who didn’t spare his own Son,
but delivered him up for us all, how would he not also with him freely
give us all things? <span class="bibleverse">33</span> Who could bring a
charge against God’s chosen ones? It is God who justifies. <span
class="bibleverse">34</span> Who is he who condemns? It is Christ who
died, yes rather, who was raised from the dead, who is at the right hand
of God, who also makes intercession for us. <span
class="bibleverse">35</span> Who shall separate us from the love of
Christ? Could oppression, or anguish, or persecution, or famine, or

<h1 id="section-10">11</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> I ask then, did God reject his
people? May it never be! For I also am an Israelite, a descendant of
Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> God
didn’t reject his people, whom he foreknew. Or don’t you know what the
Scripture says about Elijah? How he pleads with God against Israel:
<span class="bibleverse">3</span> “Lord, they have killed your prophets.
They have broken down your altars. I am left alone, and they seek my
life.”<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"

But how does God answer him? “I have reserved for myself seven thousand
men who have not bowed the knee to Baal.”<a href="#fn54"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54" role="doc-noteref"><sup>54</sup></a>
<span class="bibleverse">5</span> Even so too at this present time also
there is a remnant according to the election of grace. <span

works; otherwise grace is no longer grace. But if it is of works, it is
no longer grace; otherwise work is no longer work. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> What then? That which Israel seeks for, that
he didn’t obtain, but the chosen ones obtained it, and the rest were
hardened. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> According as it is written,
“God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that they should not see, and
ears that they should not hear, to this very day.” <a href="#fn55"

not see. Always keep their backs bent.”<a href="#fn56"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56" role="doc-noteref"><sup>56</sup></a>
<span class="bibleverse">11</span> I ask then, did they stumble that
they might fall? May it never be! But by their fall salvation has come
to the Gentiles, to provoke them to jealousy. <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> Now if their fall is the riches of the
world, and their loss the riches of the Gentiles, how much more their
fullness! <span class="bibleverse">13</span> For I speak to you who are
Gentiles. Since then as I am an apostle to Gentiles, I glorify my
ministry, <span class="bibleverse">14</span> if by any means I may
provoke to jealousy those who are my flesh, and may save some of them.
<span class="bibleverse">15</span> For if the rejection of them is the
reconciling of the world, what would their acceptance be, but life from
the dead? <span class="bibleverse">16</span> If the first fruit is holy,
so is the lump. If the root is holy, so are the branches. <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> But if some of the branches were broken
off, and you, being a wild olive, were grafted in amongst them and
became partaker with them of the root and of the richness of the olive
tree, <span class="bibleverse">18</span> don’t boast over the branches.
But if you boast, remember that it is not you who support the root, but
the root supports you. <span class="bibleverse">19</span> You will say
then, “Branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in.” <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> True; by their unbelief they were broken
off, and you stand by your faith. Don’t be conceited, but fear; <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> for if God didn’t spare the natural
branches, neither will he spare you. <span class="bibleverse">22</span>
See then the goodness and severity of God. Towards those who fell,
severity; but towards you, goodness, if you continue in his goodness;
otherwise you also will be cut off.</p>

again. <span class="bibleverse">24</span> For if you were cut out of
that which is by nature a wild olive tree, and were grafted contrary to
nature into a good olive tree, how much more will these, which are the
natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree? <span

<p><span class="bibleverse">19</span> Don’t seek revenge yourselves,
beloved, but give place to God’s wrath. For it is written, “Vengeance
belongs to me; I will repay, says the Lord.” <a href="#fn61"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61" role="doc-noteref"><sup>61</sup></a>
<span class="bibleverse">20</span> Therefore “If your enemy is hungry,
feed him. If he is thirsty, give him a drink; for in doing so, you will
heap coals of fire on his head.”<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref"

<h1 id="section-12">13</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Let every soul be in subjection to
the higher authorities, for there is no authority except from God, and
those who exist are ordained by God. <span class="bibleverse">2</span>
Therefore he who resists the authority withstands the ordinance of God;
and those who withstand will receive to themselves judgement. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> For rulers are not a terror to the good
work, but to the evil. Do you desire to have no fear of the authority?
Do that which is good, and you will have praise from the authority,
<span class="bibleverse">4</span> for he is a servant of God to you for
good. But if you do that which is evil, be afraid, for he doesn’t bear
the sword in vain; for he is a servant of God, an avenger for wrath to
him who does evil. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> Therefore you need
to be in subjection, not only because of the wrath, but also for
conscience’ sake. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> For this reason you
also pay taxes, for they are servants of God’s service, continually
doing this very thing. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> Therefore give
everyone what you owe: if you owe taxes, pay taxes; if customs, then
customs; if respect, then respect; if honour, then honour. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> Owe no one anything, except to love one
another; for he who loves his neighbour has fulfilled the law. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> For the commandments, “You shall not commit
adultery,” “You shall not murder,” “You shall not steal,”<a href="#fn63"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63" role="doc-noteref"><sup>63</sup></a>
“You shall not covet,” <a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>64</sup></a> and whatever other commandments
there are, are all summed up in this saying, namely, “You shall love
your neighbour as yourself.”<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref65" role="doc-noteref"><sup>65</sup></a> <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> Love doesn’t harm a neighbour. Love
therefore is the fulfilment of the law. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> Do this, knowing the time, that it is
already time for you to awaken out of sleep, for salvation is now nearer
to us than when we first believed. <span class="bibleverse">12</span>
The night is far gone, and the day is near. Let’s therefore throw off
the deeds of darkness, and let’s put on the armour of light. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> Let’s walk properly, as in the day; not in
revelling and drunkenness, not in sexual promiscuity and lustful acts,
and not in strife and jealousy. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> But
put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, for
its lusts.</p>
<h1 id="section-13">14</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Now accept one who is weak in
faith, but not for disputes over opinions. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> One man has faith to eat all things, but he
who is weak eats only vegetables. <span class="bibleverse">3</span>
Don’t let him who eats despise him who doesn’t eat. Don’t let him who
doesn’t eat judge him who eats, for God has accepted him. <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> Who are you who judge another’s servant? To
his own lord he stands or falls. Yes, he will be made to stand, for God
has power to make him stand. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> One man
esteems one day as more important. Another esteems every day alike. Let
each man be fully assured in his own mind. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> He who observes the day, observes it to the
Lord; and he who does not observe the day, to the Lord he does not
observe it. He who eats, eats to the Lord, for he gives God thanks. He
who doesn’t eat, to the Lord he doesn’t eat, and gives God thanks. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> For none of us lives to himself, and none
dies to himself. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> For if we live, we
live to the Lord. Or if we die, we die to the Lord. If therefore we live
or die, we are the Lord’s. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> For to this
end Christ died, rose, and lived again, that he might be Lord of both
the dead and the living. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> But you, why
do you judge your brother? Or you again, why do you despise your
brother? For we will all stand before the judgement seat of Christ.
<span class="bibleverse">11</span> For it is written, “‘As I live,’ says
the Lord, ‘to me every knee will bow. Every tongue will confess to
God.’”<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>66</sup></a> <span class="bibleverse">12</span>
So then each one of us will give account of himself to God. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> Therefore let’s not judge one another any
more, but judge this rather, that no man put a stumbling block in his
brother’s way, or an occasion for falling. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> I know and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus
that nothing is unclean of itself; except that to him who considers
anything to be unclean, to him it is unclean. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> Yet if because of food your brother is
grieved, you walk no longer in love. Don’t destroy with your food him
for whom Christ died. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> Then don’t let
your good be slandered, <span class="bibleverse">17</span> for God’s
Kingdom is not eating and drinking, but righteousness, peace, and joy in
the Holy Spirit. <span class="bibleverse">18</span> For he who serves
Christ in these things is acceptable to God and approved by men. <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> So then, let’s follow after things which
make for peace, and things by which we may build one another up. <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> Don’t overthrow God’s work for food’s sake.
All things indeed are clean, however it is evil for that man who creates
a stumbling block by eating. <span class="bibleverse">21</span> It is
good to not eat meat, drink wine, nor do anything by which your brother
stumbles, is offended, or is made weak. <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> Do you have faith? Have it to yourself
before God. Happy is he who doesn’t judge himself in that which he
approves. <span class="bibleverse">23</span> But he who doubts is
condemned if he eats, because it isn’t of faith; and whatever is not of
faith is sin. <span class="bibleverse">24</span> Now to him who is able
to establish you according to my Good News and the preaching of Jesus
Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery which has been kept
secret through long ages, <span class="bibleverse">25</span> but now is
revealed, and by the Scriptures of the prophets, according to the
commandment of the eternal God, is made known for obedience of faith to
all the nations; <span class="bibleverse">26</span> to the only wise
God, through Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory forever! Amen.<a

<h1 id="section-14">15</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Now we who are strong ought to bear
the weaknesses of the weak, and not to please ourselves. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> Let each one of us please his neighbour for
that which is good, to be building him up. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> For even Christ didn’t please himself. But,
as it is written, “The reproaches of those who reproached you fell on
me.”<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>68</sup></a> <span class="bibleverse">4</span>
For whatever things were written before were written for our learning,
that through perseverance and through encouragement of the Scriptures we
might have hope. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> Now the God of
perseverance and of encouragement grant you to be of the same mind with
one another according to Christ Jesus, <span class="bibleverse">6</span>
that with one accord you may with one mouth glorify the God and Father
of our Lord Jesus Christ. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> Therefore
accept one another, even as Christ also accepted you,<a href="#fn69"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69" role="doc-noteref"><sup>69</sup></a>
to the glory of God. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> Now I say that
Christ has been made a servant of the circumcision for the truth of God,
that he might confirm the promises given to the fathers, <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> and that the Gentiles might glorify God for
his mercy. As it is written, “Therefore I will give praise to you
amongst the Gentiles and sing to your name.”<a href="#fn70"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70" role="doc-noteref"><sup>70</sup></a>
<span class="bibleverse">10</span> Again he says, “Rejoice, you
Gentiles, with his people.”<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref71" role="doc-noteref"><sup>71</sup></a> <span

Let all the peoples praise him.”<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref"

will hope.”<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>73</sup></a> <span class="bibleverse">13</span>
Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing,
that you may abound in hope in the power of the Holy Spirit. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> I myself am also persuaded about you, my
brothers,<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>74</sup></a> that you yourselves are full of
goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish others. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> But I write the more boldly to you in part
as reminding you, because of the grace that was given to me by God,
<span class="bibleverse">16</span> that I should be a servant of Christ
Jesus to the Gentiles, serving as a priest of the Good News of God, that
the offering up of the Gentiles might be made acceptable, sanctified by
the Holy Spirit. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> I have therefore my
boasting in Christ Jesus in things pertaining to God. <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> For I will not dare to speak of any things
except those which Christ worked through me for the obedience of the
Gentiles, by word and deed, <span class="bibleverse">19</span> in the
power of signs and wonders, in the power of God’s Spirit; so that from
Jerusalem and around as far as to Illyricum, I have fully preached the
Good News of Christ; <span class="bibleverse">20</span> yes, making it
my aim to preach the Good News, not where Christ was already named, that
I might not build on another’s foundation. <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> But, as it is written, “They will see, to
whom no news of him came. They who haven’t heard will understand.”<a
href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>75</sup></a> <span class="bibleverse">22</span>
Therefore also I was hindered these many times from coming to you, <span
class="bibleverse">23</span> but now, no longer having any place in
these regions, and having these many years a longing to come to you,
<span class="bibleverse">24</span> whenever I travel to Spain, I will
come to you. For I hope to see you on my journey, and to be helped on my
way there by you, if first I may enjoy your company for a while. <span
class="bibleverse">25</span> But now, I say, I am going to Jerusalem,
serving the saints. <span class="bibleverse">26</span> For it has been
the good pleasure of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution
for the poor amongst the saints who are at Jerusalem. <span
class="bibleverse">27</span> Yes, it has been their good pleasure, and
they are their debtors. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of
their spiritual things, they owe it to them also to serve them in
material things. <span class="bibleverse">28</span> When therefore I
have accomplished this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will go on
by way of you to Spain. <span class="bibleverse">29</span> I know that
when I come to you, I will come in the fullness of the blessing of the
Good News of Christ. <span class="bibleverse">30</span> Now I beg you,

you strive together with me in your prayers to God for me,</p>
