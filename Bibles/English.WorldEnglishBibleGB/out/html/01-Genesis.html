<h2 id="the-creation-of-the-world">The creation of the world</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> In the beginning, God<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
created the heavens and the earth. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> The
earth was formless and empty. Darkness was on the surface of the deep
and God’s Spirit was hovering over the surface of the waters.</p>
<h2 id="the-creation-of-light">The creation of light</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">3</span> God said, “Let there be light,” and
there was light. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> God saw the light,
and saw that it was good. God divided the light from the darkness. <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> God called the light “day”, and the darkness
he called “night”. There was evening and there was morning, the first
day.</p>
<h2 id="the-creation-of-the-expanse-of-heaven">The creation of the
expanse of Heaven</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">6</span> God said, “Let there be an expanse
in the middle of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the
waters.” <span class="bibleverse">7</span> God made the expanse, and
divided the waters which were under the expanse from the waters which
were above the expanse; and it was so. <span class="bibleverse">8</span>
God called the expanse “sky”. There was evening and there was morning, a
second day.</p>
<h2 id="the-separation-of-land-and-sea-and-the-creation-of-plants">The
separation of land and sea and the creation of plants</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">9</span> God said, “Let the waters under the
sky be gathered together to one place, and let the dry land appear;” and
it was so. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> God called the dry land
“earth”, and the gathering together of the waters he called “seas”. God
saw that it was good. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> God said, “Let
the earth yield grass, herbs yielding seeds, and fruit trees bearing
fruit after their kind, with their seeds in it, on the earth;” and it
was so. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> The earth yielded grass,
herbs yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit, with
their seeds in it, after their kind; and God saw that it was good. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> There was evening and there was morning, a
third day.</p>
<h2 id="the-creation-of-the-stars">The creation of the stars</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">14</span> God said, “Let there be lights in
the expanse of the sky to divide the day from the night; and let them be
for signs to mark seasons, days, and years; <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> and let them be for lights in the expanse
of the sky to give light on the earth;” and it was so. <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> God made the two great lights: the greater
light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night. He also
made the stars. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> God set them in the
expanse of the sky to give light to the earth, <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> and to rule over the day and over the
night, and to divide the light from the darkness. God saw that it was
good. <span class="bibleverse">19</span> There was evening and there was
morning, a fourth day.</p>
<h2 id="the-creation-of-aquatic-animals-and-birds">The creation of
aquatic animals and birds</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">20</span> God said, “Let the waters abound
with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth in the open
expanse of the sky.” <span class="bibleverse">21</span> God created the
large sea creatures and every living creature that moves, with which the
waters swarmed, after their kind, and every winged bird after its kind.
God saw that it was good. <span class="bibleverse">22</span> God blessed
them, saying, “Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the
seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.” <span
class="bibleverse">23</span> There was evening and there was morning, a
fifth day.</p>
<h2 id="the-creation-of-land-animals-and-man">The creation of land
animals and man</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">24</span> God said, “Let the earth produce
living creatures after their kind, livestock, creeping things, and
animals of the earth after their kind;” and it was so. <span
class="bibleverse">25</span> God made the animals of the earth after
their kind, and the livestock after their kind, and everything that
creeps on the ground after its kind. God saw that it was good. <span
class="bibleverse">26</span> God said, “Let’s make man in our image,
after our likeness. Let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and
over the birds of the sky, and over the livestock, and over all the
earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.” <span
class="bibleverse">27</span> God created man in his own image. In God’s
image he created him; male and female he created them. <span
class="bibleverse">28</span> God blessed them. God said to them, “Be
fruitful, multiply, fill the earth, and subdue it. Have dominion over
the fish of the sea, over the birds of the sky, and over every living
thing that moves on the earth.” <span class="bibleverse">29</span> God
said, “Behold,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> I have given you every herb yielding
seed, which is on the surface of all the earth, and every tree, which
bears fruit yielding seed. It will be your food. <span
class="bibleverse">30</span> To every animal of the earth, and to every
bird of the sky, and to everything that creeps on the earth, in which
there is life, I have given every green herb for food;” and it was so.
<span class="bibleverse">31</span> God saw everything that he had made,
and, behold, it was very good. There was evening and there was morning,
a sixth day.</p>
<h1 id="section-1">2</h1>
<h2 id="the-sabbath">The Sabbath</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> The heavens, the earth, and all
their vast array were finished. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> On the
seventh day God finished his work which he had done; and he rested on
the seventh day from all his work which he had done. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> God blessed the seventh day, and made it
holy, because he rested in it from all his work of creation which he had
done.</p>
<h2 id="the-creation-of-man-and-woman-in-paradise">The creation of man
and woman in paradise</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">4</span> This is the history of the

the day that the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span><a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> God
made the earth and the heavens. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> No
plant of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had
yet sprung up; for the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> God had not
caused it to rain on the earth. There was not a man to till the ground,
<span class="bibleverse">6</span> but a mist went up from the earth, and
watered the whole surface of the ground. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> God
formed man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils
the breath of life; and man became a living soul. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> God
planted a garden eastward, in Eden, and there he put the man whom he had
formed. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> Out of the ground the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> God made every tree to grow that is
pleasant to the sight, and good for food, including the tree of life in
the middle of the garden and the tree of the knowledge of good and
evil.</p>
<h2 id="the-river-in-paradise-and-its-branches">The river in paradise
and its branches</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">10</span> A river went out of Eden to water
the garden; and from there it was parted, and became the source of four
rivers. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> The name of the first is
Pishon: it flows through the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;
<span class="bibleverse">12</span> and the gold of that land is good.
Bdellium<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> and onyx stone are also there. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> The name of the second river is Gihon. It
is the same river that flows through the whole land of Cush. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> The name of the third river is Hiddekel.
This is the one which flows in front of Assyria. The fourth river is the
Euphrates.</p>
<h2 id="gods-commandment-by-adam">God's commandment by Adam</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">15</span> The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> God took the man, and put him into the
garden of Eden to cultivate and keep it. <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> God
commanded the man, saying, “You may freely eat of every tree of the
garden; <span class="bibleverse">17</span> but you shall not eat of the
tree of the knowledge of good and evil; for in the day that you eat of
it, you will surely die.”</p>
<h2 id="the-creation-of-woman-and-the-foundation-of-marriage">The
creation of woman and the foundation of marriage</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">18</span> The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> God said, “It is not good for the man to
be alone. I will make him a helper comparable to<a href="#fn5"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>
him.” <span class="bibleverse">19</span> Out of the ground the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> God formed every animal of the field, and
every bird of the sky, and brought them to the man to see what he would
call them. Whatever the man called every living creature became its
name. <span class="bibleverse">20</span> The man gave names to all
livestock, and to the birds of the sky, and to every animal of the
field; but for man there was not found a helper comparable to him. <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> God
caused the man to fall into a deep sleep. As the man slept, he took one
of his ribs, and closed up the flesh in its place. <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> God
made a woman from the rib which he had taken from the man, and brought
her to the man. <span class="bibleverse">23</span> The man said, “This
is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh. She will be called
‘woman,’ because she was taken out of Man.” <span
class="bibleverse">24</span> Therefore a man will leave his father and
his mother, and will join with his wife, and they will be one flesh.
<span class="bibleverse">25</span> The man and his wife were both naked,
and they were not ashamed.</p>
<h1 id="section-2">3</h1>
<h2 id="the-temptation-and-the-fall-of-man">The temptation and the fall
of man</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Now the serpent was more subtle
than any animal of the field which the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> God had made. He said to the woman, “Has
God really said, ‘You shall not eat of any tree of the garden’?” <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> The woman said to the serpent, “We may eat
fruit from the trees of the garden, <span class="bibleverse">3</span>
but not the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden. God
has said, ‘You shall not eat of it. You shall not touch it, lest you
die.’” <span class="bibleverse">4</span> The serpent said to the woman,
“You won’t really die, <span class="bibleverse">5</span> for God knows
that in the day you eat it, your eyes will be opened, and you will be
like God, knowing good and evil.” <span class="bibleverse">6</span> When
the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight
to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she
took some of its fruit, and ate. Then she gave some to her husband with
her, and he ate it, too. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> Their eyes
were opened, and they both knew that they were naked. They sewed fig
leaves together, and made coverings for themselves.</p>
<h2 id="interrogation-and-punishment">Interrogation and Punishment</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">8</span> They heard the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> God’s voice walking in the garden in the
cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the
presence of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> God amongst the
trees of the garden. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> God called to the man, and said to him,
“Where are you?” <span class="bibleverse">10</span> The man said, “I
heard your voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked;
so I hid myself.” <span class="bibleverse">11</span> God said, “Who told
you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded
you not to eat from?” <span class="bibleverse">12</span> The man said,
“The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me fruit from the tree,
and I ate it.” <span class="bibleverse">13</span> The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> God said to the woman, “What have you
done?” The woman said, “The serpent deceived me, and I ate.” <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> God
said to the serpent, “Because you have done this, you are cursed above
all livestock, and above every animal of the field. You shall go on your
belly and you shall eat dust all the days of your life. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> I will put hostility between you and the
woman, and between your offspring and her offspring. He will bruise your
head, and you will bruise his heel.” <span class="bibleverse">16</span>
To the woman he said, “I will greatly multiply your pain in childbirth.
You will bear children in pain. Your desire will be for your husband,
and he will rule over you.” <span class="bibleverse">17</span> To Adam
he said, “Because you have listened to your wife’s voice, and have eaten
from the tree, about which I commanded you, saying, ‘You shall not eat
of it,’ the ground is cursed for your sake. You will eat from it with
much labour all the days of your life. <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> It will yield thorns and thistles to you;
and you will eat the herb of the field. <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> You will eat bread by the sweat of your
face until you return to the ground, for you were taken out of it. For
you are dust, and you shall return to dust.”</p>
<h2 id="the-expulsion-from-paradise">The expulsion from paradise</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">20</span> The man called his wife Eve
because she would be the mother of all the living. <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> God
made garments of animal skins for Adam and for his wife, and clothed
them. <span class="bibleverse">22</span> The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> God said, “Behold, the man has become like
one of us, knowing good and evil. Now, lest he reach out his hand, and
also take of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever—” <span
class="bibleverse">23</span> Therefore the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> God sent him out from the garden of Eden,
to till the ground from which he was taken. <span
class="bibleverse">24</span> So he drove out the man; and he placed
cherubim<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"

<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> The man knew<a href="#fn7"

his wife. She conceived,<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> and gave birth to Cain, and said, “I
have gotten a man with the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s help.”
<span class="bibleverse">2</span> Again she gave birth, to Cain’s
brother Abel. Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the
ground. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> As time passed, Cain brought
an offering to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> from the fruit of
the ground. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> Abel also brought some of
the firstborn of his flock and of its fat. The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> respected Abel and his offering, <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> but he didn’t respect Cain and his offering.
Cain was very angry, and the expression on his face fell. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> said
to Cain, “Why are you angry? Why has the expression of your face fallen?
<span class="bibleverse">7</span> If you do well, won’t it be lifted up?
If you don’t do well, sin crouches at the door. Its desire is for you,
but you are to rule over it.” <span class="bibleverse">8</span> Cain
said to Abel, his brother, “Let’s go into the field.” While they were in
the field, Cain rose up against Abel, his brother, and killed him.</p>
<h2 id="cains-punishment">Cain's Punishment</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">9</span> The <span

brother?” He said, “I don’t know. Am I my brother’s keeper?” <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>
said, “What have you done? The voice of your brother’s blood cries to me
from the ground. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> Now you are cursed
because of the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your
brother’s blood from your hand. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> From
now on, when you till the ground, it won’t yield its strength to you.
You will be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth.” <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> Cain said to the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, “My punishment is greater than I can
bear. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> Behold, you have driven me out
today from the surface of the ground. I will be hidden from your face,
and I will be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth. Whoever finds me
will kill me.” <span class="bibleverse">15</span> The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> said to him, “Therefore whoever slays
Cain, vengeance will be taken on him sevenfold.” The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> appointed a sign for Cain, so that anyone
finding him would not strike him. <span class="bibleverse">16</span>
Cain left the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s presence, and lived
in the land of Nod, east of Eden.</p>
<h2 id="the-sons-of-cain">The sons of Cain</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">17</span> Cain knew his wife. She conceived,
and gave birth to Enoch. He built a city, and named the city after the
name of his son, Enoch. <span class="bibleverse">18</span> Irad was born
to Enoch. Irad became the father of Mehujael. Mehujael became the father
of Methushael. Methushael became the father of Lamech. <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> Lamech took two wives: the name of the
first one was Adah, and the name of the second one was Zillah. <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> Adah gave birth to Jabal, who was the
father of those who dwell in tents and have livestock. <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> His brother’s name was Jubal, who was the
father of all who handle the harp and pipe. <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> Zillah also gave birth to Tubal Cain, the
forger of every cutting instrument of bronze and iron. Tubal Cain’s
sister was Naamah. <span class="bibleverse">23</span> Lamech said to his
wives, “Adah and Zillah, hear my voice. You wives of Lamech, listen to
my speech, for I have slain a man for wounding me, a young man for
bruising me. <span class="bibleverse">24</span> If Cain will be avenged
seven times, truly Lamech seventy-seven times.”</p>
<h2 id="the-birth-of-seth">The birth of Seth</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">25</span> Adam knew his wife again. She gave
birth to a son, and named him Seth, saying, “for God has given me
another child instead of Abel, for Cain killed him.” <span

all flesh, for the earth is filled with violence through them. Behold, I
will destroy them and the earth. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> Make
a ship of gopher wood. You shall make rooms in the ship, and shall seal
it inside and outside with pitch. <span class="bibleverse">15</span>
This is how you shall make it. The length of the ship shall be three
hundred cubits,<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> its width fifty cubits, and its
height thirty cubits. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> You shall make
a roof in the ship, and you shall finish it to a cubit upward. You shall
set the door of the ship in its side. You shall make it with lower,
second, and third levels. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> I, even I,
will bring the flood of waters on this earth, to destroy all flesh
having the breath of life from under the sky. Everything that is in the
earth will die. <span class="bibleverse">18</span> But I will establish
my covenant with you. You shall come into the ship, you, your sons, your
wife, and your sons’ wives with you. <span class="bibleverse">19</span>
Of every living thing of all flesh, you shall bring two of every sort
into the ship, to keep them alive with you. They shall be male and
female. <span class="bibleverse">20</span> Of the birds after their
kind, of the livestock after their kind, of every creeping thing of the
ground after its kind, two of every sort will come to you, to keep them
alive. <span class="bibleverse">21</span> Take with you some of all food
that is eaten, and gather it to yourself; and it will be for food for
you, and for them.” <span class="bibleverse">22</span> Thus Noah did. He
did all that God commanded him.</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> The <span

household into the ship, for I have seen your righteousness before me in
this generation. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> You shall take seven
pairs of every clean animal with you, the male and his female. Of the
animals that are not clean, take two, the male and his female. <span

every living thing that I have made from the surface of the ground.”
<span class="bibleverse">5</span> Noah did everything that the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> commanded him. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> Noah was six hundred years old when the
flood of waters came on the earth. <span class="bibleverse">7</span>
Noah went into the ship with his sons, his wife, and his sons’ wives,
because of the floodwaters. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> Clean
animals, unclean animals, birds, and everything that creeps on the
ground <span class="bibleverse">9</span> went by pairs to Noah into the
ship, male and female, as God commanded Noah. <span

on the earth.</p>
<h2 id="the-rise-of-the-deluge">The rise of the deluge</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">11</span> In the six hundredth year of
Noah’s life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month,
on that day all the fountains of the great deep burst open, and the
sky’s windows opened. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> It rained on
the earth forty days and forty nights. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> In the same day Noah, and Shem, Ham, and
Japheth—the sons of Noah—and Noah’s wife and the three wives of his sons

they, and every animal after its kind, all the livestock after their

every bird after its kind, every bird of every sort. <span

of all flesh, as God commanded him; then the <span

class="bibleverse">17</span> The flood was forty days on the earth. The
waters increased, and lifted up the ship, and it was lifted up above the
earth. <span class="bibleverse">18</span> The waters rose, and increased
greatly on the earth; and the ship floated on the surface of the waters.
<span class="bibleverse">19</span> The waters rose very high on the
earth. All the high mountains that were under the whole sky were
covered. <span class="bibleverse">20</span> The waters rose fifteen
cubits<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"

the earth, including birds, livestock, animals, every creeping thing

the breath of the spirit of life, died. <span
class="bibleverse">23</span> Every living thing was destroyed that was
on the surface of the ground, including man, livestock, creeping things,
and birds of the sky. They were destroyed from the earth. Only Noah was
left, and those who were with him in the ship. <span

<h1 id="section-7">8</h1>
<h2 id="the-end-of-the-flood">The end of the flood</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> God remembered Noah, all the
animals, and all the livestock that were with him in the ship; and God
made a wind to pass over the earth. The waters subsided. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> The deep’s fountains and the sky’s windows
were also stopped, and the rain from the sky was restrained. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> The waters continually receded from the
earth. After the end of one hundred and fifty days the waters receded.
<span class="bibleverse">4</span> The ship rested in the seventh month,
on the seventeenth day of the month, on Ararat’s mountains. <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> The waters receded continually until the
tenth month. In the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops
of the mountains were visible. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> At the
end of forty days, Noah opened the window of the ship which he had made,
<span class="bibleverse">7</span> and he sent out a raven. It went back
and forth, until the waters were dried up from the earth. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> He himself sent out a dove to see if the
waters were abated from the surface of the ground, <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> but the dove found no place to rest her
foot, and she returned into the ship to him, for the waters were on the
surface of the whole earth. He put out his hand, and took her, and
brought her to him into the ship. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> He
waited yet another seven days; and again he sent the dove out of the
ship. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> The dove came back to him at
evening and, behold, in her mouth was a freshly plucked olive leaf. So
Noah knew that the waters were abated from the earth. <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> He waited yet another seven days, and sent
out the dove; and she didn’t return to him any more. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> In the six hundred first year, in the first
month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from the
earth. Noah removed the covering of the ship, and looked. He saw that
the surface of the ground was dry. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> In
the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth was
dry. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> God spoke to Noah, saying, <span

sons, and your sons’ wives with you. <span class="bibleverse">17</span>
Bring out with you every living thing that is with you of all flesh,
including birds, livestock, and every creeping thing that creeps on the
earth, that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and
multiply on the earth.” <span class="bibleverse">18</span> Noah went
out, with his sons, his wife, and his sons’ wives with him. <span

<p><span class="bibleverse">20</span> Noah built an altar to the <span

<h2 id="noahs-drunkenness">Noah's Drunkenness</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">18</span> The sons of Noah who went out from

these the whole earth was populated. <span class="bibleverse">20</span>
Noah began to be a farmer, and planted a vineyard. <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> He drank of the wine and got drunk. He was
uncovered within his tent. <span class="bibleverse">22</span> Ham, the
father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two
brothers outside. <span class="bibleverse">23</span> Shem and Japheth
took a garment, and laid it on both their shoulders, went in backwards,
and covered the nakedness of their father. Their faces were backwards,
and they didn’t see their father’s nakedness. <span
class="bibleverse">24</span> Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his
youngest son had done to him. <span class="bibleverse">25</span> He
said, “Canaan is cursed. He will be a servant of servants to his

<h2 id="the-descendants-of-the-sons-of-noah">The descendants of the sons

<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Now this is the history of the
generations of the sons of Noah and of Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Sons were
born to them after the flood. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> The sons
of Japheth were: Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras.
<span class="bibleverse">3</span> The sons of Gomer were: Ashkenaz,
Riphath, and Togarmah. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> The sons of
Javan were: Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim. <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> Of these were the islands of the nations
divided in their lands, everyone after his language, after their
families, in their nations. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> The sons
of Ham were: Cush, Mizraim, Put, and Canaan. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> The sons of Cush were: Seba, Havilah,
Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca. The sons of Raamah were: Sheba and Dedan.
<span class="bibleverse">8</span> Cush became the father of Nimrod. He
began to be a mighty one in the earth. <span class="bibleverse">9</span>
He was a mighty hunter before the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>.
Therefore it is said, “like Nimrod, a mighty hunter before the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>”. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> The
beginning of his kingdom was Babel, Erech, Accad, and Calneh, in the
land of Shinar. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> Out of that land he
went into Assyria, and built Nineveh, Rehoboth Ir, Calah, <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> and Resen between Nineveh and the great
city Calah. <span class="bibleverse">13</span> Mizraim became the father
of Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, Naphtuhim, <span class="bibleverse">14</span>
Pathrusim, Casluhim (which the Philistines descended from), and
Caphtorim. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> Canaan became the father
of Sidon (his firstborn), Heth, <span class="bibleverse">16</span> the
Jebusites, the Amorites, the Girgashites, <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> the Hivites, the Arkites, the Sinites,
<span class="bibleverse">18</span> the Arvadites, the Zemarites, and the
Hamathites. Afterward the families of the Canaanites were spread abroad.
<span class="bibleverse">19</span> The border of the Canaanites was from
Sidon—as you go towards Gerar—to Gaza—as you go towards Sodom, Gomorrah,
Admah, and Zeboiim—to Lasha. <span class="bibleverse">20</span> These
are the sons of Ham, after their families, according to their languages,
in their lands and their nations. <span class="bibleverse">21</span>
Children were also born to Shem (the elder brother of Japheth), the
father of all the children of Eber. <span class="bibleverse">22</span>
The sons of Shem were: Elam, Asshur, Arpachshad, Lud, and Aram. <span
class="bibleverse">23</span> The sons of Aram were: Uz, Hul, Gether, and
Mash. <span class="bibleverse">24</span> Arpachshad became the father of
Shelah. Shelah became the father of Eber. <span
class="bibleverse">25</span> To Eber were born two sons. The name of the
one was Peleg, for in his days the earth was divided. His brother’s name
was Joktan. <span class="bibleverse">26</span> Joktan became the father
of Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah, <span
class="bibleverse">27</span> Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah, <span
class="bibleverse">28</span> Obal, Abimael, Sheba, <span
class="bibleverse">29</span> Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab. All these were
the sons of Joktan. <span class="bibleverse">30</span> Their dwelling
extended from Mesha, as you go towards Sephar, the mountain of the east.
<span class="bibleverse">31</span> These are the sons of Shem, by their
families, according to their languages, lands, and nations. <span
class="bibleverse">32</span> These are the families of the sons of Noah,
by their generations, according to their nations. The nations divided
from these in the earth after the flood.</p>

<span class="bibleverse">4</span> They said, “Come, let’s build
ourselves a city, and a tower whose top reaches to the sky, and let’s
make a name for ourselves, lest we be scattered abroad on the surface of

language, that they may not understand one another’s speech.” <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> So the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>
scattered them abroad from there on the surface of all the earth. They
stopped building the city. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> Therefore
its name was called Babel, because there the <span

They entered into the land of Canaan. <span class="bibleverse">6</span>
Abram passed through the land to the place of Shechem, to the oak of

servants, female donkeys, and camels. <span class="bibleverse">17</span>
The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> afflicted Pharaoh and his house

to the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first. There
Abram called on the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s name.</p>
<h2 id="abram-separates-from-lot">Abram separates from Lot</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">5</span> Lot also, who went with Abram, had
flocks, herds, and tents. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> The land was
not able to bear them, that they might live together; for their
possessions were so great that they couldn’t live together. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> There was strife between the herdsmen of
Abram’s livestock and the herdsmen of Lot’s livestock. The Canaanites
and the Perizzites lived in the land at that time. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> Abram said to Lot, “Please, let there be no
strife between you and me, and between your herdsmen and my herdsmen;
for we are relatives. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> Isn’t the whole
land before you? Please separate yourself from me. If you go to the left
hand, then I will go to the right. Or if you go to the right hand, then
I will go to the left.”</p>
<h2 id="lots-departure-through-the-jordan-valley">Lot's departure
through the Jordan Valley</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">10</span> Lot lifted up his eyes, and saw
all the plain of the Jordan, that it was well-watered everywhere, before
the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah,
like the garden of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, like the
land of Egypt, as you go to Zoar. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> So
Lot chose the Plain of the Jordan for himself. Lot travelled east, and
they separated themselves from one other. <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> Abram lived in the land of Canaan, and Lot
lived in the cities of the plain, and moved his tent as far as Sodom.
<span class="bibleverse">13</span> Now the men of Sodom were exceedingly
wicked and sinners against the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>.</p>
<h2 id="god-promises-abram-the-land-of-canaan">God promises Abram the

<p><span class="bibleverse">14</span> The <span

from him, “Now, lift up your eyes, and look from the place where you
are, northward and southward and eastward and westward, <span

to you and to your offspring forever. <span class="bibleverse">16</span>
I will make your offspring as the dust of the earth, so that if a man
can count the dust of the earth, then your offspring may also be
counted. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> Arise, walk through the land
in its length and in its width; for I will give it to you.” <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> Abram moved his tent, and came and lived by
the oaks of Mamre, which are in Hebron, and built an altar there to the

<h2 id="war-of-king-chedorlaomer-in-the-jordan-valley">War of King

<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> In the days of Amraphel, king of
Shinar; Arioch, king of Ellasar; Chedorlaomer, king of Elam; and Tidal,
king of Goiim, <span class="bibleverse">2</span> they made war with
Bera, king of Sodom; Birsha, king of Gomorrah; Shinab, king of Admah;
Shemeber, king of Zeboiim; and the king of Bela (also called Zoar).
<span class="bibleverse">3</span> All these joined together in the
valley of Siddim (also called the Salt Sea). <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> They served Chedorlaomer for twelve years,
and in the thirteenth year they rebelled. <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> In the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer and the
kings who were with him came and struck the Rephaim in Ashteroth
Karnaim, the Zuzim in Ham, the Emim in Shaveh Kiriathaim, <span

Paran, which is by the wilderness. <span class="bibleverse">7</span>
They returned, and came to En Mishpat (also called Kadesh), and struck
all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that lived in
Hazazon Tamar. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> The king of Sodom, and
the king of Gomorrah, the king of Admah, the king of Zeboiim, and the
king of Bela (also called Zoar) went out; and they set the battle in
array against them in the valley of Siddim <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> against Chedorlaomer king of Elam, Tidal
king of Goiim, Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four
kings against the five. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> Now the
valley of Siddim was full of tar pits; and the kings of Sodom and
Gomorrah fled, and some fell there. Those who remained fled to the
hills. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> They took all the goods of
Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their food, and went their way. <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> They took Lot, Abram’s brother’s son, who
lived in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.</p>
<h2 id="help-of-abram-by-lot">Help of Abram by Lot</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">13</span> One who had escaped came and told
Abram, the Hebrew. At that time, he lived by the oaks of Mamre, the
Amorite, brother of Eshcol and brother of Aner. They were allies of
Abram. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> When Abram heard that his
relative was taken captive, he led out his three hundred and eighteen
trained men, born in his house, and pursued as far as Dan. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> He divided himself against them by night,
he and his servants, and struck them, and pursued them to Hobah, which
is on the left hand of Damascus. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> He
brought back all the goods, and also brought back his relative Lot and
his goods, and the women also, and the other people.</p>
<h2 id="abram-meets-melchizedek-king-of-salem">Abram meets Melchizedek,

who were with him, at the valley of Shaveh (that is, the King’s Valley).
<span class="bibleverse">18</span> Melchizedek king of Salem brought out
bread and wine. He was priest of God Most High. <span

of God Most High, possessor of heaven and earth. <span

<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> After these things the <span

towards the sky, and count the stars, if you are able to count them.” He
said to Abram, “So your offspring will be.” <span

righteousness.</p>
<h2 id="god-confirm-his-promise">God confirm his promise</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">7</span> He said to Abram, “I am the <span

He said, “Lord GOD, how will I know that I will inherit it?” <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> He said to him, “Bring me a heifer three
years old, a female goat three years old, a ram three years old, a
turtledove, and a young pigeon.” <span class="bibleverse">10</span> He
brought him all these, and divided them in the middle, and laid each
half opposite the other; but he didn’t divide the birds. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> The birds of prey came down on the
carcasses, and Abram drove them away. <span class="bibleverse">12</span>
When the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell on Abram. Now terror and
great darkness fell on him. <span class="bibleverse">13</span> He said
to Abram, “Know for sure that your offspring will live as foreigners in
a land that is not theirs, and will serve them. They will afflict them
four hundred years. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> I will also judge
that nation, whom they will serve. Afterward they will come out with
great wealth; <span class="bibleverse">15</span> but you will go to your

here again, for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet full.” <span

down, and it was dark, behold, a smoking furnace and a flaming torch
passed between these pieces. <span class="bibleverse">18</span> In that
day the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> made a covenant with Abram,

listened to the voice of Sarai. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> Sarai,
Abram’s wife, took Hagar the Egyptian, her servant, after Abram had
lived ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to Abram her husband
to be his wife. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> He went in to Hagar,
and she conceived. When she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was
despised in her eyes. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> Sarai said to

if there are forty found there?” He said, “I will not do it for the
forty’s sake.” <span class="bibleverse">30</span> He said, “Oh don’t let
the Lord be angry, and I will speak. What if there are thirty found
there?” He said, “I will not do it if I find thirty there.” <span

myself to speak to the Lord. What if there are twenty found there?” He
said, “I will not destroy it for the twenty’s sake.” <span

anybody else here? Sons-in-law, your sons, your daughters, and whomever
you have in the city, bring them out of the place: <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> for we will destroy this place, because the
outcry against them has grown so great before the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> that the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> has sent us to destroy it.” <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> Lot went out, and spoke to his sons-in-law,
who were pledged to marry his daughters, and said, “Get up! Get out of
this place, for the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> will destroy the
city!” But he seemed to his sons-in-law to be joking. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> When the morning came, then the angels
hurried Lot, saying, “Get up! Take your wife and your two daughters who
are here, lest you be consumed in the iniquity of the city.” <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> But he lingered; and the men grabbed his
hand, his wife’s hand, and his two daughters’ hands, the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> being merciful to him; and they took him
out, and set him outside of the city. <span class="bibleverse">17</span>
It came to pass, when they had taken them out, that he said, “Escape for
your life! Don’t look behind you, and don’t stay anywhere in the plain.
Escape to the mountains, lest you be consumed!” <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> Lot said to them, “Oh, not so, my lord.
<span class="bibleverse">19</span> See now, your servant has found
favour in your sight, and you have magnified your loving kindness, which
you have shown to me in saving my life. I can’t escape to the mountain,
lest evil overtake me, and I die. <span class="bibleverse">20</span> See
now, this city is near to flee to, and it is a little one. Oh let me
escape there (isn’t it a little one?), and my soul will live.” <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> He said to him, “Behold, I have granted
your request concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow the
city of which you have spoken. <span class="bibleverse">22</span> Hurry,
escape there, for I can’t do anything until you get there.” Therefore
the name of the city was called Zoar.<a href="#fn19"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a>
<span class="bibleverse">23</span> The sun had risen on the earth when
Lot came to Zoar. <span class="bibleverse">24</span> Then the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> rained on Sodom and on Gomorrah sulphur
and fire from the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> out of the sky.
<span class="bibleverse">25</span> He overthrew those cities, all the
plain, all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew on the
ground. <span class="bibleverse">26</span> But Lot’s wife looked back
from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt. <span
class="bibleverse">27</span> Abraham went up early in the morning to the
place where he had stood before the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>.
<span class="bibleverse">28</span> He looked towards Sodom and Gomorrah,
and towards all the land of the plain, and saw that the smoke of the
land went up as the smoke of a furnace. <span
class="bibleverse">29</span> When God destroyed the cities of the plain,
God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the middle of the overthrow,
when he overthrew the cities in which Lot lived.</p>

sin of Lot's daughters; The birth of the parents of the Moabites and
Ammonites</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">30</span> Lot went up out of Zoar, and lived
in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he was afraid to
live in Zoar. He lived in a cave with his two daughters. <span
class="bibleverse">31</span> The firstborn said to the younger, “Our
father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in to us in
the way of all the earth. <span class="bibleverse">32</span> Come, let’s
make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may
preserve our father’s family line.” <span class="bibleverse">33</span>
They made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in,
and lay with her father. He didn’t know when she lay down, nor when she
arose. <span class="bibleverse">34</span> It came to pass on the next
day, that the firstborn said to the younger, “Behold, I lay last night
with my father. Let’s make him drink wine again tonight. You go in, and
lie with him, that we may preserve our father’s family line.” <span
class="bibleverse">35</span> They made their father drink wine that
night also. The younger went and lay with him. He didn’t know when she
lay down, nor when she got up. <span class="bibleverse">36</span> Thus
both of Lot’s daughters were with child by their father. <span
class="bibleverse">37</span> The firstborn bore a son, and named him
Moab. He is the father of the Moabites to this day. <span
class="bibleverse">38</span> The younger also bore a son, and called his
name Ben Ammi. He is the father of the children of Ammon to this
day.</p>

<h2 id="abraham-to-abimelech-in-gerar">Abraham to Abimelech in
Gerar</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Abraham travelled from there
towards the land of the South, and lived between Kadesh and Shur. He
lived as a foreigner in Gerar. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> Abraham
said about Sarah his wife, “She is my sister.” Abimelech king of Gerar
sent, and took Sarah. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> But God came to
Abimelech in a dream of the night, and said to him, “Behold, you are a
dead man, because of the woman whom you have taken; for she is a man’s
wife.” <span class="bibleverse">4</span> Now Abimelech had not come near
her. He said, “Lord, will you kill even a righteous nation? <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> Didn’t he tell me, ‘She is my sister’? She,
even she herself, said, ‘He is my brother.’ I have done this in the
integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands.” <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> God said to him in the dream, “Yes, I know
that in the integrity of your heart you have done this, and I also
withheld you from sinning against me. Therefore I didn’t allow you to
touch her. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> Now therefore, restore the
man’s wife. For he is a prophet, and he will pray for you, and you will
live. If you don’t restore her, know for sure that you will die, you,
and all who are yours.” <span class="bibleverse">8</span> Abimelech rose
early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these
things in their ear. The men were very scared. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said to
him, “What have you done to us? How have I sinned against you, that you
have brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? You have done deeds to
me that ought not to be done!” <span class="bibleverse">10</span>
Abimelech said to Abraham, “What did you see, that you have done this
thing?” <span class="bibleverse">11</span> Abraham said, “Because I
thought, ‘Surely the fear of God is not in this place. They will kill me
for my wife’s sake.’ <span class="bibleverse">12</span> Besides, she is
indeed my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my
mother; and she became my wife. <span class="bibleverse">13</span> When
God caused me to wander from my father’s house, I said to her, ‘This is
your kindness which you shall show to me. Everywhere that we go, say of
me, “He is my brother.”’” <span class="bibleverse">14</span> Abimelech
took sheep and cattle, male servants and female servants, and gave them
to Abraham, and restored Sarah, his wife, to him. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> Abimelech said, “Behold, my land is before
you. Dwell where it pleases you.” <span class="bibleverse">16</span> To
Sarah he said, “Behold, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of
silver. Behold, it is for you a covering of the eyes to all that are
with you. In front of all you are vindicated.” <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> Abraham prayed to God. So God healed
Abimelech, his wife, and his female servants, and they bore children.
<span class="bibleverse">18</span> For the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> had closed up tight all the wombs of the
house of Abimelech, because of Sarah, Abraham’s wife.</p>
<h1 id="section-20">21</h1>
<h2 id="birth-of-isaac">Birth of Isaac</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> visited Sarah as he had said, and the
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> did to Sarah as he had spoken. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> Sarah conceived, and bore Abraham a son in
his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> Abraham called his son who was born to him,
whom Sarah bore to him, Isaac.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> Abraham circumcised his son, Isaac, when he
was eight days old, as God had commanded him. <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> Abraham was one hundred years old when his
son, Isaac, was born to him. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> Sarah
said, “God has made me laugh. Everyone who hears will laugh with me.”
<span class="bibleverse">7</span> She said, “Who would have said to
Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? For I have borne him a son in
his old age.” <span class="bibleverse">8</span> The child grew and was
weaned. Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned.</p>
<h2 id="the-repudiation-and-salvation-of-ishmael">The repudiation and
salvation of Ishmael</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">9</span> Sarah saw the son of Hagar the
Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, mocking. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> Therefore she said to Abraham, “Cast out
this servant and her son! For the son of this servant will not be heir
with my son, Isaac.” <span class="bibleverse">11</span> The thing was
very grievous in Abraham’s sight on account of his son. <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> God said to Abraham, “Don’t let it be
grievous in your sight because of the boy, and because of your servant.
In all that Sarah says to you, listen to her voice. For your offspring
will be named through Isaac. <span class="bibleverse">13</span> I will
also make a nation of the son of the servant, because he is your child.”
<span class="bibleverse">14</span> Abraham rose up early in the morning,
and took bread and a container of water, and gave it to Hagar, putting
it on her shoulder; and gave her the child, and sent her away. She
departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> The water in the container was spent, and
she put the child under one of the shrubs. <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> She went and sat down opposite him, a good
way off, about a bow shot away. For she said, “Don’t let me see the
death of the child.” She sat opposite him, and lifted up her voice, and
wept. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> God heard the voice of the boy.
The angel of God called to Hagar out of the sky, and said to her, “What
troubles you, Hagar? Don’t be afraid. For God has heard the voice of the
boy where he is. <span class="bibleverse">18</span> Get up, lift up the
boy, and hold him with your hand. For I will make him a great nation.”
<span class="bibleverse">19</span> God opened her eyes, and she saw a
well of water. She went, filled the container with water, and gave the
boy a drink. <span class="bibleverse">20</span> God was with the boy,
and he grew. He lived in the wilderness, and as he grew up, he became an
archer. <span class="bibleverse">21</span> He lived in the wilderness of
Paran. His mother got a wife for him out of the land of Egypt.</p>
<h2 id="the-covenant-between-abraham-and-abimelech">The covenant between
Abraham and Abimelech</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">22</span> At that time, Abimelech and Phicol
the captain of his army spoke to Abraham, saying, “God is with you in
all that you do. <span class="bibleverse">23</span> Now, therefore,
swear to me here by God that you will not deal falsely with me, nor with
my son, nor with my son’s son. But according to the kindness that I have
done to you, you shall do to me, and to the land in which you have lived
as a foreigner.” <span class="bibleverse">24</span> Abraham said, “I
will swear.” <span class="bibleverse">25</span> Abraham complained to
Abimelech because of a water well, which Abimelech’s servants had
violently taken away. <span class="bibleverse">26</span> Abimelech said,
“I don’t know who has done this thing. You didn’t tell me, and I didn’t
hear of it until today.” <span class="bibleverse">27</span> Abraham took
sheep and cattle, and gave them to Abimelech. Those two made a covenant.
<span class="bibleverse">28</span> Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the
flock by themselves. <span class="bibleverse">29</span> Abimelech said
to Abraham, “What do these seven ewe lambs, which you have set by
themselves, mean?” <span class="bibleverse">30</span> He said, “You
shall take these seven ewe lambs from my hand, that it may be a witness
to me, that I have dug this well.” <span class="bibleverse">31</span>
Therefore he called that place Beersheba,<a href="#fn21"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a>
because they both swore an oath there. <span
class="bibleverse">32</span> So they made a covenant at Beersheba.
Abimelech rose up with Phicol, the captain of his army, and they
returned into the land of the Philistines. <span
class="bibleverse">33</span> Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in
Beersheba, and there he called on the name of the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the Everlasting God. <span

the Philistines many days.</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> After these things, God tested
Abraham, and said to him, “Abraham!” He said, “Here I am.” <span

Isaac, whom you love, and go into the land of Moriah. Offer him there as
a burnt offering on one of the mountains which I will tell you of.”</p>
<h2 id="abrahams-obedience">Abraham's Obedience</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">3</span> Abraham rose early in the morning,
and saddled his donkey; and took two of his young men with him, and
Isaac his son. He split the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up,
and went to the place of which God had told him. <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes,
and saw the place far off. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> Abraham
said to his young men, “Stay here with the donkey. The boy and I will go
over there. We will worship, and come back to you.” <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering
and laid it on Isaac his son. He took in his hand the fire and the
knife. They both went together. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> Isaac
spoke to Abraham his father, and said, “My father?” He said, “Here I am,
my son.” He said, “Here is the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb
for a burnt offering?” <span class="bibleverse">8</span> Abraham said,
“God will provide himself the lamb for a burnt offering, my son.” So
they both went together.</p>

preparation of the holocaust and the intervention of God</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">9</span> They came to the place which God

order, bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar, on the wood.
<span class="bibleverse">10</span> Abraham stretched out his hand, and
took the knife to kill his son. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> The
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s angel called to him out of the
sky, and said, “Abraham, Abraham!” He said, “Here I am.” <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> He said, “Don’t lay your hand on the boy or
do anything to him. For now I know that you fear God, since you have not
withheld your son, your only son, from me.” <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and
saw that behind him was a ram caught in the thicket by his horns.
Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering
instead of his son. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> Abraham called
the name of that place “The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> Will
Provide”.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"

you have done this thing, and have not withheld your son, your only son,

Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel.” <span

eight Milcah bore to Nahor, Abraham’s brother. <span

Hebron), in the land of Canaan. Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to
weep for her. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> Abraham rose up from
before his dead and spoke to the children of Heth, saying, <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> “I am a stranger and a foreigner living with
you. Give me a possession of a burying-place with you, that I may bury
my dead out of my sight.” <span class="bibleverse">5</span> The children
of Heth answered Abraham, saying to him, <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> “Hear us, my lord. You are a prince of God
amongst us. Bury your dead in the best of our tombs. None of us will
withhold from you his tomb. Bury your dead.” <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> Abraham rose up, and bowed himself to the
people of the land, to the children of Heth. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> He talked with them, saying, “If you agree
that I should bury my dead out of my sight, hear me, and entreat for me
to Ephron the son of Zohar, <span class="bibleverse">9</span> that he
may sell me the cave of Machpelah, which he has, which is in the end of
his field. For the full price let him sell it to me amongst you as a
possession for a burial place.” <span class="bibleverse">10</span> Now
Ephron was sitting in the middle of the children of Heth. Ephron the
Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of the children of Heth, even of
all who went in at the gate of his city, saying, <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> “No, my lord, hear me. I give you the
field, and I give you the cave that is in it. In the presence of the
children of my people I give it to you. Bury your dead.” <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> Abraham bowed himself down before the
people of the land. <span class="bibleverse">13</span> He spoke to
Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, “But if you
will, please hear me. I will give the price of the field. Take it from
me, and I will bury my dead there.” <span class="bibleverse">14</span>
Ephron answered Abraham, saying to him, <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> “My lord, listen to me. What is a piece of
land worth four hundred shekels of silver<a href="#fn23"

class="bibleverse">16</span> Abraham listened to Ephron. Abraham weighed
to Ephron the silver which he had named in the hearing of the children
of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, according to the current
merchants’ standard. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> So the field of
Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, the
cave which was in it, and all the trees that were in the field, that
were in all of its borders, were deeded <span

of the children of Heth, before all who went in at the gate of his city.
<span class="bibleverse">19</span> After this, Abraham buried Sarah his
wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre (that is,
Hebron), in the land of Canaan. <span class="bibleverse">20</span> The

this I will know that you have shown kindness to my master.” <span

your pitcher.” <span class="bibleverse">18</span> She said, “Drink, my

drink. <span class="bibleverse">19</span> When she had finished giving
him a drink, she said, “I will also draw for your camels, until they
have finished drinking.” <span class="bibleverse">20</span> She hurried,

He said, “Blessed be the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the God of
my master Abraham, who has not forsaken his loving kindness and his
truth towards my master. As for me, the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> has led me on the way to the house of my
master’s relatives.” <span class="bibleverse">28</span> The young lady
ran, and told her mother’s house about these words. <span
class="bibleverse">29</span> Rebekah had a brother, and his name was
Laban. Laban ran out to the man, to the spring. <span
class="bibleverse">30</span> When he saw the ring, and the bracelets on
his sister’s hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister,
saying, “This is what the man said to me,” he came to the man. Behold,
he was standing by the camels at the spring. <span
class="bibleverse">31</span> He said, “Come in, you blessed of the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. Why do you stand outside? For I have
prepared the house, and room for the camels.” <span
class="bibleverse">32</span> The man came into the house, and he
unloaded the camels. He gave straw and feed for the camels, and water to
wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him. <span
class="bibleverse">33</span> Food was set before him to eat, but he
said, “I will not eat until I have told my message.” Laban said, “Speak
on.”</p>
<h2 id="the-courtship-for-the-bride">The courtship for the bride</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">34</span> He said, “I am Abraham’s servant.
<span class="bibleverse">35</span> The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> has blessed my master greatly. He has
become great. The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> has given him
flocks and herds, silver and gold, male servants and female servants,
and camels and donkeys. <span class="bibleverse">36</span> Sarah, my
master’s wife, bore a son to my master when she was old. He has given
all that he has to him. <span class="bibleverse">37</span> My master
made me swear, saying, ‘You shall not take a wife for my son from the
daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I live, <span
class="bibleverse">38</span> but you shall go to my father’s house, and
to my relatives, and take a wife for my son.’ <span
class="bibleverse">39</span> I asked my master, ‘What if the woman will
not follow me?’ <span class="bibleverse">40</span> He said to me, ‘The
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, before whom I walk, will send his
angel with you, and prosper your way. You shall take a wife for my son
from my relatives, and of my father’s house. <span
class="bibleverse">41</span> Then you will be clear from my oath, when
you come to my relatives. If they don’t give her to you, you shall be
clear from my oath.’ <span class="bibleverse">42</span> I came today to
the spring, and said, ‘The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the God
of my master Abraham, if now you do prosper my way which I go— <span
class="bibleverse">43</span> behold, I am standing by this spring of
water. Let it happen, that the maiden who comes out to draw, to whom I
will say, “Please give me a little water from your pitcher to drink,”
<span class="bibleverse">44</span> then she tells me, “Drink, and I will
also draw for your camels,”—let her be the woman whom the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> has appointed for my master’s son.’ <span
class="bibleverse">45</span> Before I had finished speaking in my heart,
behold, Rebekah came out with her pitcher on her shoulder. She went down
to the spring, and drew. I said to her, ‘Please let me drink.’ <span
class="bibleverse">46</span> She hurried and let down her pitcher from
her shoulder, and said, ‘Drink, and I will also give your camels a
drink.’ So I drank, and she also gave the camels a drink. <span
class="bibleverse">47</span> I asked her, and said, ‘Whose daughter are
you?’ She said, ‘The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor’s son, whom Milcah bore
to him.’ I put the ring on her nose, and the bracelets on her hands.
<span class="bibleverse">48</span> I bowed my head, and worshipped the
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and blessed the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the God of my master Abraham, who had led
me in the right way to take my master’s brother’s daughter for his son.
<span class="bibleverse">49</span> Now if you will deal kindly and truly
with my master, tell me. If not, tell me, that I may turn to the right
hand, or to the left.”</p>
<h2 id="rebekahs-farewell">Rebekah's farewell</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">50</span> Then Laban and Bethuel answered,
“The thing proceeds from the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. We

Behold, Rebekah is before you. Take her, and go, and let her be your
master’s son’s wife, as the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> has
spoken.” <span class="bibleverse">52</span> When Abraham’s servant heard
their words, he bowed himself down to the earth to the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. <span class="bibleverse">53</span> The
servant brought out jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and clothing,
and gave them to Rebekah. He also gave precious things to her brother
and her mother. <span class="bibleverse">54</span> They ate and drank,
he and the men who were with him, and stayed all night. They rose up in
the morning, and he said, “Send me away to my master.” <span
class="bibleverse">55</span> Her brother and her mother said, “Let the
young lady stay with us a few days, at least ten. After that she will
go.” <span class="bibleverse">56</span> He said to them, “Don’t hinder
me, since the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> has prospered my way.
Send me away that I may go to my master.” <span
class="bibleverse">57</span> They said, “We will call the young lady,
and ask her.” <span class="bibleverse">58</span> They called Rebekah,
and said to her, “Will you go with this man?” She said, “I will go.”
<span class="bibleverse">59</span> They sent away Rebekah, their sister,
with her nurse, Abraham’s servant, and his men. <span
class="bibleverse">60</span> They blessed Rebekah, and said to her, “Our
sister, may you be the mother of thousands of ten thousands, and let
your offspring possess the gate of those who hate them.” <span
class="bibleverse">61</span> Rebekah arose with her ladies. They rode on
the camels, and followed the man. The servant took Rebekah, and went his
way.</p>

the evening. He lifted up his eyes and looked. Behold, there were camels
coming. <span class="bibleverse">64</span> Rebekah lifted up her eyes,
and when she saw Isaac, she got off the camel. <span
class="bibleverse">65</span> She said to the servant, “Who is the man
who is walking in the field to meet us?” The servant said, “It is my
master.” She took her veil, and covered herself. <span
class="bibleverse">66</span> The servant told Isaac all the things that
he had done. <span class="bibleverse">67</span> Isaac brought her into

loved her. So Isaac was comforted after his mother’s death.</p>

<h2 id="the-birth-of-esau-and-jacob">The birth of Esau and Jacob</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">19</span> This is the history of the
generations of Isaac, Abraham’s son. Abraham became the father of Isaac.
<span class="bibleverse">20</span> Isaac was forty years old when he
took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Paddan Aram, the
sister of Laban the Syrian, to be his wife. <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> Isaac entreated the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> for his wife, because she was barren. The
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> was entreated by him, and Rebekah
his wife conceived. <span class="bibleverse">22</span> The children
struggled together within her. She said, “If it is like this, why do I
live?” She went to enquire of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>.
<span class="bibleverse">23</span> The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> said to her, “Two nations are in your
womb. Two peoples will be separated from your body. The one people will
be stronger than the other people. The elder will serve the younger.”
<span class="bibleverse">24</span> When her days to be delivered were
fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb. <span
class="bibleverse">25</span> The first came out red all over, like a
hairy garment. They named him Esau. <span class="bibleverse">26</span>
After that, his brother came out, and his hand had hold on Esau’s heel.
He was named Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them. <span
class="bibleverse">27</span> The boys grew. Esau was a skilful hunter, a
man of the field. Jacob was a quiet man, living in tents. <span
class="bibleverse">28</span> Now Isaac loved Esau, because he ate his
venison. Rebekah loved Jacob.</p>
<h2 id="jacob-buys-esaus-birthright">Jacob buys Esau's birthright</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">29</span> Jacob boiled stew. Esau came in
from the field, and he was famished. <span class="bibleverse">30</span>
Esau said to Jacob, “Please feed me with some of that red stew, for I am
famished.” Therefore his name was called Edom.<a href="#fn25"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a>
<span class="bibleverse">31</span> Jacob said, “First, sell me your

about to die. What good is the birthright to me?” <span
class="bibleverse">33</span> Jacob said, “Swear to me first.” He swore
to him. He sold his birthright to Jacob. <span
class="bibleverse">34</span> Jacob gave Esau bread and lentil stew. He
ate and drank, rose up, and went his way. So Esau despised his
birthright.</p>

<h2 id="isaac-moves-to-gerar-when-there-is-hunger">Isaac moves to Gerar
when there is hunger</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> There was a famine in the land, in
addition to the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. Isaac went
to Abimelech king of the Philistines, to Gerar. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>
appeared to him, and said, “Don’t go down into Egypt. Live in the land I
will tell you about. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> Live in this
land, and I will be with you, and will bless you. For I will give to
you, and to your offspring, all these lands, and I will establish the
oath which I swore to Abraham your father. <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> I will multiply your offspring as the stars
of the sky, and will give all these lands to your offspring. In your
offspring all the nations of the earth will be blessed, <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> because Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my
requirements, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.” <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> Isaac lived in Gerar. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> The men of the place asked him about his
wife. He said, “She is my sister,” for he was afraid to say, “My wife”,
lest, he thought, “the men of the place might kill me for Rebekah,
because she is beautiful to look at.” <span class="bibleverse">8</span>
When he had been there a long time, Abimelech king of the Philistines
looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was caressing
Rebekah, his wife. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> Abimelech called
Isaac, and said, “Behold, surely she is your wife. Why did you say, ‘She
is my sister?’” Isaac said to him, “Because I said, ‘Lest I die because
of her.’” <span class="bibleverse">10</span> Abimelech said, “What is
this you have done to us? One of the people might easily have lain with
your wife, and you would have brought guilt on us!” <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> Abimelech commanded all the people, saying,
“He who touches this man or his wife will surely be put to death.”</p>
<h2 id="isaacs-growing-wealth-font-disputes">Isaac's growing wealth;

<p><span class="bibleverse">12</span> Isaac sowed in that land, and
reaped in the same year one hundred times what he planted. The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> blessed him. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> The man grew great, and grew more and more
until he became very great. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> He had
possessions of flocks, possessions of herds, and a great household. The
Philistines envied him. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> Now all the
wells which his father’s servants had dug in the days of Abraham his
father, the Philistines had stopped, and filled with earth. <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> Abimelech said to Isaac, “Go away from us,
for you are much mightier than we.” <span class="bibleverse">17</span>
Isaac departed from there, encamped in the valley of Gerar, and lived
there. <span class="bibleverse">18</span> Isaac dug again the wells of
water, which they had dug in the days of Abraham his father, for the
Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham. He called their
names after the names by which his father had called them. <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> Isaac’s servants dug in the valley, and
found there a well of flowing<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> water. <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> The herdsmen of Gerar argued with Isaac’s
herdsmen, saying, “The water is ours.” So he called the name of the well
Esek,<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> because they contended with him.
<span class="bibleverse">21</span> They dug another well, and they
argued over that, also. So he called its name Sitnah.<a href="#fn28"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a>
<span class="bibleverse">22</span> He left that place, and dug another

“I am the God of Abraham your father. Don’t be afraid, for I am with
you, and will bless you, and multiply your offspring for my servant
Abraham’s sake.” <span class="bibleverse">25</span> He built an altar
there, and called on the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s name, and
pitched his tent there. There Isaac’s servants dug a well.</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">26</span> Then Abimelech went to him from
Gerar with Ahuzzath his friend, and Phicol the captain of his army.
<span class="bibleverse">27</span> Isaac said to them, “Why have you
come to me, since you hate me, and have sent me away from you?” <span
class="bibleverse">28</span> They said, “We saw plainly that the <span

an oath between us, even between us and you, and let’s make a covenant
with you, <span class="bibleverse">29</span> that you will do us no
harm, as we have not touched you, and as we have done to you nothing but
good, and have sent you away in peace.’ You are now the blessed of the
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>.” <span class="bibleverse">30</span>
He made them a feast, and they ate and drank. <span
class="bibleverse">31</span> They rose up some time in the morning, and
swore an oath to one another. Isaac sent them away, and they departed
from him in peace. <span class="bibleverse">32</span> The same day,
Isaac’s servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had
dug, and said to him, “We have found water.” <span

“Let your curse be on me, my son. Only obey my voice, and go get them
for me.” <span class="bibleverse">14</span> He went, and got them, and
brought them to his mother. His mother made savoury food, such as his
father loved. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> Rebekah took the good
clothes of Esau, her elder son, which were with her in the house, and
put them on Jacob, her younger son. <span class="bibleverse">16</span>
She put the skins of the young goats on his hands, and on the smooth of

<span class="bibleverse">22</span> Jacob went near to Isaac his father.
He felt him, and said, “The voice is Jacob’s voice, but the hands are
the hands of Esau.” <span class="bibleverse">23</span> He didn’t
recognise him, because his hands were hairy, like his brother Esau’s
hands. So he blessed him. <span class="bibleverse">24</span> He said,
“Are you really my son Esau?” He said, “I am.” <span

now, and kiss me, my son.” <span class="bibleverse">27</span> He came
near, and kissed him. He smelled the smell of his clothing, and blessed

<p><span class="bibleverse">41</span> Esau hated Jacob because of the
blessing with which his father blessed him. Esau said in his heart, “The
days of mourning for my father are at hand. Then I will kill my brother
Jacob.” <span class="bibleverse">42</span> The words of Esau, her elder
son, were told to Rebekah. She sent and called Jacob, her younger son,
and said to him, “Behold, your brother Esau comforts himself about you
by planning to kill you. <span class="bibleverse">43</span> Now
therefore, my son, obey my voice. Arise, flee to Laban, my brother, in
Haran. <span class="bibleverse">44</span> Stay with him a few days,
until your brother’s fury turns away— <span class="bibleverse">45</span>
until your brother’s anger turns away from you, and he forgets what you
have done to him. Then I will send, and get you from there. Why should I
be bereaved of you both in one day?” <span class="bibleverse">46</span>
Rebekah said to Isaac, “I am weary of my life because of the daughters
of Heth. If Jacob takes a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these,
of the daughters of the land, what good will my life do me?”</p>
<h1 id="section-27">28</h1>
<h2 id="jacob-flees-to-padan-aram">Jacob flees to Padan-aram</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Isaac called Jacob, blessed him,
and commanded him, “You shall not take a wife of the daughters of
Canaan. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> Arise, go to Paddan Aram, to
the house of Bethuel your mother’s father. Take a wife from there from
the daughters of Laban, your mother’s brother. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> May God Almighty bless you, and make you
fruitful, and multiply you, that you may be a company of peoples, <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> and give you the blessing of Abraham, to you
and to your offspring with you, that you may inherit the land where you
travel, which God gave to Abraham.” <span class="bibleverse">5</span>
Isaac sent Jacob away. He went to Paddan Aram to Laban, son of Bethuel
the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob’s and Esau’s mother.</p>
<h2 id="the-new-marriage-of-esau-with-a-daughter-of-ishmael">The new
marriage of Esau with a daughter of Ishmael</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">6</span> Now Esau saw that Isaac had blessed
Jacob and sent him away to Paddan Aram, to take him a wife from there,
and that as he blessed him he gave him a command, saying, “You shall not
take a wife of the daughters of Canaan;” <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> and that Jacob obeyed his father and his
mother, and was gone to Paddan Aram. <span class="bibleverse">8</span>
Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan didn’t please Isaac, his father.
<span class="bibleverse">9</span> So Esau went to Ishmael, and took, in
addition to the wives that he had, Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael,
Abraham’s son, the sister of Nebaioth, to be his wife.</p>
<h2 id="jacobs-dream-at-bethel-of-the-stairway-to-heaven">Jacob's Dream
at Bethel of the Stairway to Heaven</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">10</span> Jacob went out from Beersheba, and
went towards Haran. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> He came to a
certain place, and stayed there all night, because the sun had set. He
took one of the stones of the place, and put it under his head, and lay
down in that place to sleep. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> He
dreamt and saw a stairway set upon the earth, and its top reached to
heaven. Behold, the angels of God were ascending and descending on it.
<span class="bibleverse">13</span> Behold, the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> stood above it, and said, “I am the <span

God of Isaac. I will give the land you lie on to you and to your
offspring. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> Your offspring will be as
the dust of the earth, and you will spread abroad to the west, and to
the east, and to the north, and to the south. In you and in your
offspring, all the families of the earth will be blessed. <span

<p><span class="bibleverse">16</span> Jacob awakened out of his sleep,
and he said, “Surely the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is in this
place, and I didn’t know it.” <span class="bibleverse">17</span> He was
afraid, and said, “How awesome this place is! This is none other than
God’s house, and this is the gate of heaven.” <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> Jacob rose up early in the morning, and
took the stone that he had put under his head, and set it up for a
pillar, and poured oil on its top. <span class="bibleverse">19</span> He
called the name of that place Bethel, but the name of the city was Luz
at the first. <span class="bibleverse">20</span> Jacob vowed a vow,
saying, “If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go,
and will give me bread to eat, and clothing to put on, <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> so that I come again to my father’s house
in peace, and the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> will be my God,
<span class="bibleverse">22</span> then this stone, which I have set up

<h2 id="jacob-to-the-well-of-haran">Jacob to the well of Haran</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Then Jacob went on his journey, and
came to the land of the children of the east. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> He looked, and saw a well in the field, and
saw three flocks of sheep lying there by it. For out of that well they
watered the flocks. The stone on the well’s mouth was large. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> There all the flocks were gathered. They
rolled the stone from the well’s mouth, and watered the sheep, and put
the stone back on the well’s mouth in its place. <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> Jacob said to them, “My relatives, where are
you from?” They said, “We are from Haran.” <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> He said to them, “Do you know Laban, the son
of Nahor?” They said, “We know him.” <span class="bibleverse">6</span>
He said to them, “Is it well with him?” They said, “It is well. See,
Rachel, his daughter, is coming with the sheep.” <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> He said, “Behold, it is still the middle of
the day, not time to gather the livestock together. Water the sheep, and
go and feed them.” <span class="bibleverse">8</span> They said, “We
can’t, until all the flocks are gathered together, and they roll the
stone from the well’s mouth. Then we will water the sheep.”</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">9</span> While he was yet speaking with
them, Rachel came with her father’s sheep, for she kept them. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> When Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of
Laban, his mother’s brother, and the sheep of Laban, his mother’s
brother, Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well’s mouth,
and watered the flock of Laban his mother’s brother. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his
voice, and wept. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> Jacob told Rachel
that he was her father’s relative, and that he was Rebekah’s son. She
ran and told her father. <span class="bibleverse">13</span> When Laban
heard the news of Jacob, his sister’s son, he ran to meet Jacob, and
embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. Jacob told
Laban all these things. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> Laban said to
him, “Surely you are my bone and my flesh.” Jacob stayed with him for a
month.</p>
<h2 id="jacob-goes-into-service-with-laban">Jacob goes into service with

<p><span class="bibleverse">15</span> Laban said to Jacob, “Because you
are my relative, should you therefore serve me for nothing? Tell me,
what will your wages be?” <span class="bibleverse">16</span> Laban had
two daughters. The name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the
younger was Rachel. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> Leah’s eyes were
weak, but Rachel was beautiful in form and attractive. <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> Jacob loved Rachel. He said, “I will serve
you seven years for Rachel, your younger daughter.” <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> Laban said, “It is better that I give her
to you, than that I should give her to another man. Stay with me.” <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> Jacob served seven years for Rachel. They
seemed to him but a few days, for the love he had for her. <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> Jacob said to Laban, “Give me my wife, for
my days are fulfilled, that I may go in to her.” <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> Laban gathered together all the men of the
place, and made a feast. <span class="bibleverse">23</span> In the
evening, he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to Jacob. He went in
to her. <span class="bibleverse">24</span> Laban gave Zilpah his servant
to his daughter Leah for a servant. <span class="bibleverse">25</span>
In the morning, behold, it was Leah! He said to Laban, “What is this you
have done to me? Didn’t I serve with you for Rachel? Why then have you
deceived me?” <span class="bibleverse">26</span> Laban said, “It is not
done so in our place, to give the younger before the firstborn. <span
class="bibleverse">27</span> Fulfil the week of this one, and we will
give you the other also for the service which you will serve with me for
seven more years.” <span class="bibleverse">28</span> Jacob did so, and
fulfilled her week. He gave him Rachel his daughter as wife. <span
class="bibleverse">29</span> Laban gave Bilhah, his servant, to his
daughter Rachel to be her servant. <span class="bibleverse">30</span> He
went in also to Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and
served with him seven more years.</p>
<h2 id="leahs-first-four-sons">Leah's first four sons</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">31</span> The <span

conceived, and bore a son, and she named him Reuben. For she said,
“Because the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> has looked at my
affliction; for now my husband will love me.” <span
class="bibleverse">33</span> She conceived again, and bore a son, and
said, “Because the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> has heard that I
am hated, he has therefore given me this son also.” She named him
Simeon. <span class="bibleverse">34</span> She conceived again, and bore
a son. She said, “Now this time my husband will be joined to me, because
I have borne him three sons.” Therefore his name was called Levi. <span

said, “This time I will praise the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>.”
Therefore she named him Judah. Then she stopped bearing.</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> When Rachel saw that she bore Jacob

anger burnt against Rachel, and he said, “Am I in God’s place, who has
withheld from you the fruit of the womb?” <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> She said, “Behold, my maid Bilhah. Go in to
her, that she may bear on my knees, and I also may obtain children by
her.” <span class="bibleverse">4</span> She gave him Bilhah her servant
as wife, and Jacob went in to her. <span class="bibleverse">5</span>
Bilhah conceived, and bore Jacob a son. <span

also heard my voice, and has given me a son.” Therefore she called his
name Dan. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> Bilhah, Rachel’s servant,
conceived again, and bore Jacob a second son. <span

named him Gad. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> Zilpah, Leah’s

<p><span class="bibleverse">14</span> Reuben went in the days of wheat

“Is it a small matter that you have taken away my husband? Would you
take away my son’s mandrakes, also?” Rachel said, “Therefore he will lie
with you tonight for your son’s mandrakes.” <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> Jacob came from the field in the evening,
and Leah went out to meet him, and said, “You must come in to me; for I
have surely hired you with my son’s mandrakes.” He lay with her that
night. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> God listened to Leah, and she
conceived, and bore Jacob a fifth son. <span

because I gave my servant to my husband.” She named him Issachar. <span

<p><span class="bibleverse">25</span> When Rachel had borne Joseph,

my children for whom I have served you, and let me go; for you know my
service with which I have served you.” <span

favour in your eyes, stay here, for I have divined that the <span

class="bibleverse">28</span> He said, “Appoint me your wages, and I will
give it.” <span class="bibleverse">29</span> Jacob said to him, “You
know how I have served you, and how your livestock have fared with me.
<span class="bibleverse">30</span> For it was little which you had
before I came, and it has increased to a multitude. The <span

when will I provide for my own house also?” <span
class="bibleverse">31</span> Laban said, “What shall I give you?” Jacob
said, “You shall not give me anything. If you will do this thing for me,
I will again feed your flock and keep it. <span
class="bibleverse">32</span> I will pass through all your flock today,
removing from there every speckled and spotted one, and every black one
amongst the sheep, and the spotted and speckled amongst the goats. This
will be my hire. <span class="bibleverse">33</span> So my righteousness
will answer for me hereafter, when you come concerning my hire that is
before you. Every one that is not speckled and spotted amongst the
goats, and black amongst the sheep, that might be with me, will be
considered stolen.” <span class="bibleverse">34</span> Laban said,
“Behold, let it be according to your word.”</p>
<h2 id="jacob-obtained-a-large-cattle-estate-through-cunning">Jacob

<p><span class="bibleverse">35</span> That day, he removed the male
goats that were streaked and spotted, and all the female goats that were
speckled and spotted, every one that had white in it, and all the black
ones amongst the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons. <span
class="bibleverse">36</span> He set three days’ journey between himself
and Jacob, and Jacob fed the rest of Laban’s flocks. <span
class="bibleverse">37</span> Jacob took to himself rods of fresh poplar,
almond, and plane tree, peeled white streaks in them, and made the white
appear which was in the rods. <span class="bibleverse">38</span> He set
the rods which he had peeled opposite the flocks in the watering troughs
where the flocks came to drink. They conceived when they came to drink.
<span class="bibleverse">39</span> The flocks conceived before the rods,
and the flocks produced streaked, speckled, and spotted. <span
class="bibleverse">40</span> Jacob separated the lambs, and set the
faces of the flocks towards the streaked and all the black in Laban’s
flock. He put his own droves apart, and didn’t put them into Laban’s
flock. <span class="bibleverse">41</span> Whenever the stronger of the
flock conceived, Jacob laid the rods in front of the eyes of the flock
in the watering troughs, that they might conceive amongst the rods;
<span class="bibleverse">42</span> but when the flock were feeble, he
didn’t put them in. So the feebler were Laban’s, and the stronger
Jacob’s. <span class="bibleverse">43</span> The man increased
exceedingly, and had large flocks, female servants and male servants,
and camels and donkeys.</p>

<h2 id="the-reasons-for-jacobs-flight">The reasons for Jacob's

<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Jacob heard Laban’s sons’ words,

all this wealth from that which was our father’s.” <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> Jacob saw the expression on Laban’s face,
and, behold, it was not towards him as before. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> said

and I will be with you.”</p>
<h2 id="jacobs-consultation-with-his-wives">Jacob's consultation with

<p><span class="bibleverse">4</span> Jacob sent and called Rachel and

said to them, “I see the expression on your father’s face, that it is
not towards me as before; but the God of my father has been with me.
<span class="bibleverse">6</span> You know that I have served your
father with all of my strength. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> Your
father has deceived me, and changed my wages ten times, but God didn’t
allow him to hurt me. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> If he said, ‘The
speckled will be your wages,’ then all the flock bore speckled. If he
said, ‘The streaked will be your wages,’ then all the flock bore
streaked. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> Thus God has taken away your
father’s livestock, and given them to me. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> During mating season, I lifted up my eyes,
and saw in a dream, and behold, the male goats which leapt on the flock
were streaked, speckled, and grizzled. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> The angel of God said to me in the dream,
‘Jacob,’ and I said, ‘Here I am.’ <span class="bibleverse">12</span> He
said, ‘Now lift up your eyes, and behold, all the male goats which leap
on the flock are streaked, speckled, and grizzled, for I have seen all
that Laban does to you. <span class="bibleverse">13</span> I am the God
of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar, where you vowed a vow to me. Now
arise, get out from this land, and return to the land of your birth.’”
<span class="bibleverse">14</span> Rachel and Leah answered him, “Is
there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father’s house? <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> Aren’t we considered as foreigners by him?
For he has sold us, and has also used up our money. <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> For all the riches which God has taken away
from our father are ours and our children’s. Now then, whatever God has
said to you, do.”</p>
<h2 id="jacobs-flight-and-labans-persecution">Jacob's Flight and Laban's

<p><span class="bibleverse">17</span> Then Jacob rose up, and set his
sons and his wives on the camels, <span class="bibleverse">18</span> and
he took away all his livestock, and all his possessions which he had
gathered, including the livestock which he had gained in Paddan Aram, to
go to Isaac his father, to the land of Canaan. <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> Now Laban had gone to shear his sheep; and
Rachel stole the teraphim<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a> that were her
father’s. <span class="bibleverse">20</span> Jacob deceived Laban the
Syrian, in that he didn’t tell him that he was running away. <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> So he fled with all that he had. He rose
up, passed over the River, and set his face towards the mountain of
Gilead. <span class="bibleverse">22</span> Laban was told on the third
day that Jacob had fled. <span class="bibleverse">23</span> He took his
relatives with him, and pursued him seven days’ journey. He overtook him
in the mountain of Gilead. <span class="bibleverse">24</span> God came
to Laban the Syrian in a dream of the night, and said to him, “Be
careful that you don’t speak to Jacob either good or bad.”</p>
<h2 id="labans-punishing-speech-and-house-search">Laban's punishing

<p><span class="bibleverse">25</span> Laban caught up with Jacob. Now
Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountain, and Laban with his relatives
encamped in the mountain of Gilead. <span class="bibleverse">26</span>
Laban said to Jacob, “What have you done, that you have deceived me, and
carried away my daughters like captives of the sword? <span
class="bibleverse">27</span> Why did you flee secretly, and deceive me,
and didn’t tell me, that I might have sent you away with mirth and with
songs, with tambourine and with harp; <span class="bibleverse">28</span>
and didn’t allow me to kiss my sons and my daughters? Now have you done
foolishly. <span class="bibleverse">29</span> It is in the power of my
hand to hurt you, but the God of your father spoke to me last night,
saying, ‘Be careful that you don’t speak to Jacob either good or bad.’
<span class="bibleverse">30</span> Now, you want to be gone, because you
greatly longed for your father’s house, but why have you stolen my
gods?” <span class="bibleverse">31</span> Jacob answered Laban, “Because
I was afraid, for I said, ‘Lest you should take your daughters from me
by force.’ <span class="bibleverse">32</span> Anyone you find your gods
with shall not live. Before our relatives, discern what is yours with
me, and take it.” For Jacob didn’t know that Rachel had stolen them.
<span class="bibleverse">33</span> Laban went into Jacob’s tent, into
Leah’s tent, and into the tent of the two female servants; but he didn’t
find them. He went out of Leah’s tent, and entered into Rachel’s tent.
<span class="bibleverse">34</span> Now Rachel had taken the teraphim,
put them in the camel’s saddle, and sat on them. Laban felt around all
the tent, but didn’t find them. <span class="bibleverse">35</span> She
said to her father, “Don’t let my lord be angry that I can’t rise up
before you; for I’m having my period.” He searched, but didn’t find the
teraphim.</p>
<h2 id="jacobs-impeachment-speech">Jacob's Impeachment Speech</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">36</span> Jacob was angry, and argued with
Laban. Jacob answered Laban, “What is my trespass? What is my sin, that
you have hotly pursued me? <span class="bibleverse">37</span> Now that
you have felt around in all my stuff, what have you found of all your
household stuff? Set it here before my relatives and your relatives,
that they may judge between us two. <span class="bibleverse">38</span>
“These twenty years I have been with you. Your ewes and your female
goats have not cast their young, and I haven’t eaten the rams of your
flocks. <span class="bibleverse">39</span> That which was torn of
animals, I didn’t bring to you. I bore its loss. Of my hand you required
it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night. <span
class="bibleverse">40</span> This was my situation: in the day the
drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep fled from my
eyes. <span class="bibleverse">41</span> These twenty years I have been
in your house. I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and
six years for your flock, and you have changed my wages ten times. <span
class="bibleverse">42</span> Unless the God of my father, the God of
Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely now you would
have sent me away empty. God has seen my affliction and the labour of my
hands, and rebuked you last night.”</p>
<h2 id="labans-reply-the-peace-treaty-between-him-and-jacob">Laban's

<p><span class="bibleverse">43</span> Laban answered Jacob, “The

daughters, or to their children whom they have borne? <span
class="bibleverse">44</span> Now come, let’s make a covenant, you and I.
Let it be for a witness between me and you.” <span
class="bibleverse">45</span> Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a

“Gather stones.” They took stones, and made a heap. They ate there by
the heap. <span class="bibleverse">47</span> Laban called it Jegar
Sahadutha,<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"

Laban said, “This heap is witness between me and you today.” Therefore
it was named Galeed <span class="bibleverse">49</span> and Mizpah, for
he said, “The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> watch between me and
you, when we are absent one from another. <span
class="bibleverse">50</span> If you afflict my daughters, or if you take
wives in addition to my daughters, no man is with us; behold, God is
witness between me and you.” <span class="bibleverse">51</span> Laban
said to Jacob, “See this heap, and see the pillar, which I have set
between me and you. <span class="bibleverse">52</span> May this heap be
a witness, and the pillar be a witness, that I will not pass over this
heap to you, and that you will not pass over this heap and this pillar
to me, for harm. <span class="bibleverse">53</span> The God of Abraham,
and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us.” Then
Jacob swore by the fear of his father, Isaac. <span
class="bibleverse">54</span> Jacob offered a sacrifice in the mountain,
and called his relatives to eat bread. They ate bread, and stayed all
night in the mountain. <span class="bibleverse">55</span> Early in the
morning, Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and
blessed them. Laban departed and returned to his place.</p>

<h2 id="jacob-sends-messengers-to-esau">Jacob sends messengers to

<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Jacob went on his way, and the
angels of God met him. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> When he saw
them, Jacob said, “This is God’s army.” He called the name of that place
Mahanaim.<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a> <span class="bibleverse">3</span>
Jacob sent messengers in front of him to Esau, his brother, to the land
of Seir, the field of Edom. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> He
commanded them, saying, “This is what you shall tell my lord, Esau:
‘This is what your servant, Jacob, says. I have lived as a foreigner
with Laban, and stayed until now. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> I
have cattle, donkeys, flocks, male servants, and female servants. I have
sent to tell my lord, that I may find favour in your sight.’” <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> The messengers returned to Jacob, saying,
“We came to your brother Esau. He is coming to meet you, and four
hundred men are with him.” <span class="bibleverse">7</span> Then Jacob
was greatly afraid and was distressed. He divided the people who were
with him, along with the flocks, the herds, and the camels, into two
companies. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> He said, “If Esau comes to
the one company, and strikes it, then the company which is left will
escape.”</p>
<h2 id="jacobs-prayer-for-gods-help">Jacob's prayer for God's help</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">9</span> Jacob said, “God of my father
Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, who said to me, ‘Return to your country,
and to your relatives, and I will do you good,’ <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> I am not worthy of the least of all the
loving kindnesses, and of all the truth, which you have shown to your
servant; for with just my staff I crossed over this Jordan; and now I
have become two companies. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> Please
deliver me from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau; for I
fear him, lest he come and strike me and the mothers with the children.
<span class="bibleverse">12</span> You said, ‘I will surely do you good,
and make your offspring as the sand of the sea, which can’t be counted
because there are so many.’”</p>
<h2 id="jacob-sends-gifts-to-esau">Jacob sends gifts to Esau</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">13</span> He stayed there that night, and
took from that which he had with him a present for Esau, his brother:
<span class="bibleverse">14</span> two hundred female goats and twenty
male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams, <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> thirty milk camels and their colts, forty
cows, ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten foals. <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> He delivered them into the hands of his
servants, every herd by itself, and said to his servants, “Pass over
before me, and put a space between herd and herd.” <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> He commanded the foremost, saying, “When
Esau, my brother, meets you, and asks you, saying, ‘Whose are you? Where
are you going? Whose are these before you?’ <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> Then you shall say, ‘They are your servant,
Jacob’s. It is a present sent to my lord, Esau. Behold, he also is
behind us.’” <span class="bibleverse">19</span> He commanded also the
second, and the third, and all that followed the herds, saying, “This is
how you shall speak to Esau, when you find him. <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> You shall say, ‘Not only that, but behold,
your servant, Jacob, is behind us.’” For, he said, “I will appease him
with the present that goes before me, and afterward I will see his face.
Perhaps he will accept me.” <span class="bibleverse">21</span> So the
present passed over before him, and he himself stayed that night in the
camp.</p>
<h2 id="jacob-wrestling-with-god-at-night">Jacob wrestling with God at
night</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">22</span> He rose up that night, and took
his two wives, and his two servants, and his eleven sons, and crossed
over the ford of the Jabbok. <span class="bibleverse">23</span> He took
them, and sent them over the stream, and sent over that which he had.
<span class="bibleverse">24</span> Jacob was left alone, and wrestled
with a man there until the breaking of the day. <span
class="bibleverse">25</span> When he saw that he didn’t prevail against
him, the man touched the hollow of his thigh, and the hollow of Jacob’s
thigh was strained as he wrestled. <span class="bibleverse">26</span>
The man said, “Let me go, for the day breaks.” Jacob said, “I won’t let
you go unless you bless me.” <span class="bibleverse">27</span> He said
to him, “What is your name?” He said, “Jacob”. <span
class="bibleverse">28</span> He said, “Your name will no longer be
called Jacob, but Israel; for you have fought with God and with men, and
have prevailed.” <span class="bibleverse">29</span> Jacob asked him,
“Please tell me your name.” He said, “Why is it that you ask what my
name is?” So he blessed him there. <span class="bibleverse">30</span>
Jacob called the name of the place Peniel;<a href="#fn37"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37" role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a>
for he said, “I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.”
<span class="bibleverse">31</span> The sun rose on him as he passed over
Peniel, and he limped because of his thigh. <span
class="bibleverse">32</span> Therefore the children of Israel don’t eat
the sinew of the hip, which is on the hollow of the thigh, to this day,
because he touched the hollow of Jacob’s thigh in the sinew of the
hip.</p>

<h2 id="jacobs-reconciliation-with-esau">Jacob's reconciliation with
Esau</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Jacob lifted up his eyes, and
looked, and, behold, Esau was coming, and with him four hundred men. He
divided the children between Leah, Rachel, and the two servants. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> He put the servants and their children in
front, Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph at the rear.
<span class="bibleverse">3</span> He himself passed over in front of
them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to
his brother. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> Esau ran to meet him,
embraced him, fell on his neck, kissed him, and they wept. <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> He lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and
the children; and said, “Who are these with you?” He said, “The children
whom God has graciously given your servant.” <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> Then the servants came near with their
children, and they bowed themselves. <span class="bibleverse">7</span>
Leah also and her children came near, and bowed themselves. After them,
Joseph came near with Rachel, and they bowed themselves. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> Esau said, “What do you mean by all this
company which I met?” Jacob said, “To find favour in the sight of my
lord.” <span class="bibleverse">9</span> Esau said, “I have enough, my
brother; let that which you have be yours.” <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> Jacob said, “Please, no, if I have now
found favour in your sight, then receive my present at my hand, because
I have seen your face, as one sees the face of God, and you were pleased
with me. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> Please take the gift that I
brought to you, because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I
have enough.” He urged him, and he took it.</p>
<h2 id="jacob-refuses-to-escort-esau-this-returns-to-seir">Jacob refuses
to escort Esau; this returns to Seir</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">12</span> Esau said, “Let’s take our
journey, and let’s go, and I will go before you.” <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> Jacob said to him, “My lord knows that the
children are tender, and that the flocks and herds with me have their
young, and if they overdrive them one day, all the flocks will die.
<span class="bibleverse">14</span> Please let my lord pass over before
his servant, and I will lead on gently, according to the pace of the
livestock that are before me and according to the pace of the children,
until I come to my lord to Seir.” <span class="bibleverse">15</span>
Esau said, “Let me now leave with you some of the people who are with
me.” He said, “Why? Let me find favour in the sight of my lord.” <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> So Esau returned that day on his way to
Seir.</p>

Succoth and settles with Shechêm</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">17</span> Jacob travelled to Succoth, built

the parcel of ground where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the

<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Dinah, the daughter of Leah, whom
she bore to Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, the
prince of the land, saw her. He took her, lay with her, and humbled her.
<span class="bibleverse">3</span> His soul joined to Dinah, the daughter
of Jacob, and he loved the young lady, and spoke kindly to the young
lady. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> Shechem spoke to his father,
Hamor, saying, “Get me this young lady as a wife.” <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> Now Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah,
his daughter; and his sons were with his livestock in the field. Jacob
held his peace until they came.</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">6</span> Hamor the father of Shechem went
out to Jacob to talk with him. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> The
sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard it. The men were
grieved, and they were very angry, because he had done folly in Israel
in lying with Jacob’s daughter, a thing that ought not to be done. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> Hamor talked with them, saying, “The soul of
my son, Shechem, longs for your daughter. Please give her to him as a
wife. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> Make marriages with us. Give
your daughters to us, and take our daughters for yourselves. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> You shall dwell with us, and the land will
be before you. Live and trade in it, and get possessions in it.” <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> Shechem said to her father and to her
brothers, “Let me find favour in your eyes, and whatever you will tell
me I will give. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> Ask me a great amount
for a dowry, and I will give whatever you ask of me, but give me the

request of the sons of Jacob is accepted by the Shechemites</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">13</span> The sons of Jacob answered Shechem

Dinah their sister, <span class="bibleverse">14</span> and said to them,
“We can’t do this thing, to give our sister to one who is uncircumcised;
for that is a reproach to us. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> Only on
this condition will we consent to you. If you will be as we are, that
every male of you be circumcised, <span class="bibleverse">16</span>
then will we give our daughters to you; and we will take your daughters
to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people. <span

circumcised, then we will take our sister,<a href="#fn40"

and we will be gone.” <span class="bibleverse">18</span> Their words
pleased Hamor and Shechem, Hamor’s son. <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> The young man didn’t wait to do this thing,
because he had delight in Jacob’s daughter, and he was honoured above
all the house of his father. <span class="bibleverse">20</span> Hamor
and Shechem, his son, came to the gate of their city, and talked with
the men of their city, saying, <span class="bibleverse">21</span> “These
men are peaceful with us. Therefore let them live in the land and trade
in it. For behold, the land is large enough for them. Let’s take their
daughters to us for wives, and let’s give them our daughters. <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> Only on this condition will the men consent
to us to live with us, to become one people, if every male amongst us is
circumcised, as they are circumcised. <span class="bibleverse">23</span>
Won’t their livestock and their possessions and all their animals be
ours? Only let’s give our consent to them, and they will dwell with us.”
<span class="bibleverse">24</span> All who went out of the gate of his

<p><span class="bibleverse">25</span> On the third day, when they were
sore, two of Jacob’s sons, Simeon and Levi, Dinah’s brothers, each took
his sword, came upon the unsuspecting city, and killed all the males.
<span class="bibleverse">26</span> They killed Hamor and Shechem, his
son, with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem’s house,
and went away. <span class="bibleverse">27</span> Jacob’s sons came on
the dead, and plundered the city, because they had defiled their sister.
<span class="bibleverse">28</span> They took their flocks, their herds,
their donkeys, that which was in the city, that which was in the field,
<span class="bibleverse">29</span> and all their wealth. They took

everything that was in the house.</p>

gather themselves together against me and strike me, and I will be
destroyed, I and my house.” <span class="bibleverse">31</span> They

who were with him, “Put away the foreign gods that are amongst you,
purify yourselves, change your garments. <span

make there an altar to God, who answered me in the day of my distress,
and was with me on the way which I went.” <span

Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem. <span

<h2 id="the-beginnings-of-the-brothers-enmity-against-joseph">The
beginnings of the brothers' enmity against Joseph</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Jacob lived in the land of his
father’s travels, in the land of Canaan. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> This is the history of the generations of
Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his
brothers. He was a boy with the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, his father’s
wives. Joseph brought an evil report of them to their father. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his
children, because he was the son of his old age, and he made him a tunic
of many colours. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> His brothers saw that
their father loved him more than all his brothers, and they hated him,
and couldn’t speak peaceably to him.</p>
<h2 id="joses-dreams">Jose's dreams</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">5</span> Joseph dreamt a dream, and he told
it to his brothers, and they hated him all the more. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> He said to them, “Please hear this dream
which I have dreamt: <span class="bibleverse">7</span> for behold, we
were binding sheaves in the field, and behold, my sheaf arose and also
stood upright; and behold, your sheaves came around, and bowed down to
my sheaf.” <span class="bibleverse">8</span> His brothers asked him,
“Will you indeed reign over us? Will you indeed have dominion over us?”
They hated him all the more for his dreams and for his words. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> He dreamt yet another dream, and told it to
his brothers, and said, “Behold, I have dreamt yet another dream: and
behold, the sun and the moon and eleven stars bowed down to me.” <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> He told it to his father and to his
brothers. His father rebuked him, and said to him, “What is this dream
that you have dreamt? Will I and your mother and your brothers indeed
come to bow ourselves down to the earth before you?” <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> His brothers envied him, but his father
kept this saying in mind.</p>
<h2 id="chance-to-get-rid-of-joseph">Chance to get rid of Joseph</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">12</span> His brothers went to feed their
father’s flock in Shechem. <span class="bibleverse">13</span> Israel
said to Joseph, “Aren’t your brothers feeding the flock in Shechem?
Come, and I will send you to them.” He said to him, “Here I am.” <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> He said to him, “Go now, see whether it is
well with your brothers, and well with the flock; and bring me word
again.” So he sent him out of the valley of Hebron, and he came to
Shechem. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> A certain man found him, and
behold, he was wandering in the field. The man asked him, “What are you
looking for?” <span class="bibleverse">16</span> He said, “I am looking
for my brothers. Tell me, please, where they are feeding the flock.”
<span class="bibleverse">17</span> The man said, “They have left here,
for I heard them say, ‘Let’s go to Dothan.’” Joseph went after his
brothers, and found them in Dothan. <span class="bibleverse">18</span>
They saw him afar off, and before he came near to them, they conspired
against him to kill him. <span class="bibleverse">19</span> They said to
one another, “Behold, this dreamer comes. <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> Come now therefore, and let’s kill him, and
cast him into one of the pits, and we will say, ‘An evil animal has
devoured him.’ We will see what will become of his dreams.”</p>
<h2 id="reuben-and-judah-try-to-save-josé">Reuben and Judah try to save
José</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">21</span> Reuben heard it, and delivered him
out of their hand, and said, “Let’s not take his life.” <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> Reuben said to them, “Shed no blood. Throw
him into this pit that is in the wilderness, but lay no hand on
him”—that he might deliver him out of their hand, to restore him to his
father. <span class="bibleverse">23</span> When Joseph came to his
brothers, they stripped Joseph of his tunic, the tunic of many colours
that was on him; <span class="bibleverse">24</span> and they took him,
and threw him into the pit. The pit was empty. There was no water in it.
<span class="bibleverse">25</span> They sat down to eat bread, and they
lifted up their eyes and looked, and saw a caravan of Ishmaelites was
coming from Gilead, with their camels bearing spices and balm and myrrh,
going to carry it down to Egypt. <span class="bibleverse">26</span>
Judah said to his brothers, “What profit is it if we kill our brother
and conceal his blood? <span class="bibleverse">27</span> Come, and
let’s sell him to the Ishmaelites, and not let our hand be on him; for
he is our brother, our flesh.” His brothers listened to him.</p>
<h2 id="joseph-is-sold-to-egypt">Joseph is sold to Egypt</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">28</span> Midianites who were merchants
passed by, and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold
Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver. The merchants
brought Joseph into Egypt. <span class="bibleverse">29</span> Reuben
returned to the pit, and saw that Joseph wasn’t in the pit; and he tore
his clothes. <span class="bibleverse">30</span> He returned to his
brothers, and said, “The child is no more; and I, where will I go?”
<span class="bibleverse">31</span> They took Joseph’s tunic, and killed
a male goat, and dipped the tunic in the blood. <span
class="bibleverse">32</span> They took the tunic of many colours, and
they brought it to their father, and said, “We have found this. Examine
it, now, and see if it is your son’s tunic or not.”</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">33</span> He recognised it, and said, “It is
my son’s tunic. An evil animal has devoured him. Joseph is without doubt
torn in pieces.” <span class="bibleverse">34</span> Jacob tore his
clothes, and put sackcloth on his waist, and mourned for his son many
days. <span class="bibleverse">35</span> All his sons and all his
daughters rose up to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted. He
said, “For I will go down to Sheol<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref43" role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a> to my son, mourning.”
His father wept for him. <span class="bibleverse">36</span> The
Midianites sold him into Egypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh’s, the
captain of the guard.</p>

<h2 id="the-sons-of-judah-and-thamar">The sons of Judah and Thamar</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> At that time, Judah went down from
his brothers, and visited a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.
<span class="bibleverse">2</span> There, Judah saw the daughter of a
certain Canaanite man named Shua. He took her, and went in to her. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> She conceived, and bore a son; and he named
him Er. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> She conceived again, and bore
a son; and she named him Onan. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> She yet
again bore a son, and named him Shelah. He was at Chezib when she bore
him. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> Judah took a wife for Er, his
firstborn, and her name was Tamar. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> Er,
Judah’s firstborn, was wicked in the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s sight. So the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> killed him. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> Judah said to Onan, “Go in to your brother’s
wife, and perform the duty of a husband’s brother to her, and raise up
offspring for your brother.” <span class="bibleverse">9</span> Onan knew
that the offspring wouldn’t be his; and when he went in to his brother’s
wife, he spilled his semen on the ground, lest he should give offspring
to his brother. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> The thing which he
did was evil in the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s sight, and he
killed him also. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> Then Judah said to
Tamar, his daughter-in-law, “Remain a widow in your father’s house,
until Shelah, my son, is grown up;” for he said, “Lest he also die, like
his brothers.” Tamar went and lived in her father’s house.</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">12</span> After many days, Shua’s daughter,
the wife of Judah, died. Judah was comforted, and went up to his sheep
shearers to Timnah, he and his friend Hirah, the Adullamite. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> Tamar was told, “Behold, your father-in-law
is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep.” <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> She took off the garments of her widowhood,
and covered herself with her veil, and wrapped herself, and sat in the
gate of Enaim, which is on the way to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah
was grown up, and she wasn’t given to him as a wife. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> When Judah saw her, he thought that she was
a prostitute, for she had covered her face. <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> He turned to her by the way, and said,
“Please come, let me come in to you,” for he didn’t know that she was
his daughter-in-law. She said, “What will you give me, that you may come
in to me?” <span class="bibleverse">17</span> He said, “I will send you
a young goat from the flock.” She said, “Will you give me a pledge,
until you send it?” <span class="bibleverse">18</span> He said, “What
pledge will I give you?” She said, “Your signet and your cord, and your
staff that is in your hand.” He gave them to her, and came in to her,
and she conceived by him. <span class="bibleverse">19</span> She arose,
and went away, and put off her veil from her, and put on the garments of
her widowhood. <span class="bibleverse">20</span> Judah sent the young
goat by the hand of his friend, the Adullamite, to receive the pledge
from the woman’s hand, but he didn’t find her. <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> Then he asked the men of her place, saying,
“Where is the prostitute, that was at Enaim by the road?” They said,
“There has been no prostitute here.” <span class="bibleverse">22</span>
He returned to Judah, and said, “I haven’t found her; and also the men
of the place said, ‘There has been no prostitute here.’” <span
class="bibleverse">23</span> Judah said, “Let her keep it, lest we be
shamed. Behold, I sent this young goat, and you haven’t found her.”</p>
<h2 id="judas-righteous-judgment-on-himself-and-thamar">Judas righteous

<p><span class="bibleverse">24</span> About three months later, Judah
was told, “Tamar, your daughter-in-law, has played the prostitute.
Moreover, behold, she is with child by prostitution.” Judah said, “Bring
her out, and let her be burnt.” <span class="bibleverse">25</span> When
she was brought out, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, “I am with
child by the man who owns these.” She also said, “Please discern whose
these are—the signet, and the cords, and the staff.” <span
class="bibleverse">26</span> Judah acknowledged them, and said, “She is
more righteous than I, because I didn’t give her to Shelah, my son.” He
knew her again no more.</p>

brother came out, and she said, “Why have you made a breach for

<h2 id="joseph-in-potiphars-house">Joseph in Potiphar's house</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Joseph was brought down to Egypt.
Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh’s, the captain of the guard, an
Egyptian, bought him from the hand of the Ishmaelites that had brought
him down there. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous
man. He was in the house of his master the Egyptian. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> His master saw that the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> was with him, and that the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> made all that he did prosper in his hand.
<span class="bibleverse">4</span> Joseph found favour in his sight. He
ministered to him, and Potiphar made him overseer over his house, and
all that he had he put into his hand. <span class="bibleverse">5</span>
From the time that he made him overseer in his house, and over all that
he had, the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> blessed the Egyptian’s
house for Joseph’s sake. The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s
blessing was on all that he had, in the house and in the field. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> He left all that he had in Joseph’s hand. He
didn’t concern himself with anything, except for the food which he ate.
Joseph was well-built and handsome.</p>
<h2 id="the-seduction-of-potiphars-wife">The Seduction of Potiphar's
Wife</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">7</span> After these things, his master’s
wife set her eyes on Joseph; and she said, “Lie with me.” <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> But he refused, and said to his master’s
wife, “Behold, my master doesn’t know what is with me in the house, and
he has put all that he has into my hand. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> No one is greater in this house than I am,
and he has not kept back anything from me but you, because you are his
wife. How then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?”
<span class="bibleverse">10</span> As she spoke to Joseph day by day, he
didn’t listen to her, to lie by her, or to be with her. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> About this time, he went into the house to
do his work, and there were none of the men of the house inside. <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> She caught him by his garment, saying, “Lie
with me!” He left his garment in her hand, and ran outside. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> When she saw that he had left his garment
in her hand, and had run outside, <span class="bibleverse">14</span> she
called to the men of her house, and spoke to them, saying, “Behold, he
has brought a Hebrew in to us to mock us. He came in to me to lie with
me, and I cried with a loud voice. <span class="bibleverse">15</span>
When he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, he left his garment
by me, and ran outside.” <span class="bibleverse">16</span> She laid up
his garment by her, until his master came home. <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> She spoke to him according to these words,
saying, “The Hebrew servant, whom you have brought to us, came in to me
to mock me, <span class="bibleverse">18</span> and as I lifted up my
voice and cried, he left his garment by me, and ran outside.”</p>
<h2 id="jose-in-jail">Jose in Jail</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">19</span> When his master heard the words of

Joseph’s master took him, and put him into the prison, the place where
the king’s prisoners were bound, and he was there in custody. <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> But the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>
was with Joseph, and showed kindness to him, and gave him favour in the
sight of the keeper of the prison. <span class="bibleverse">22</span>
The keeper of the prison committed to Joseph’s hand all the prisoners
who were in the prison. Whatever they did there, he was responsible for
it. <span class="bibleverse">23</span> The keeper of the prison didn’t
look after anything that was under his hand, because the <span

<p><span class="bibleverse">5</span> They both dreamt a dream, each man

in the morning, and saw them, and saw that they were sad. <span

him in custody in his master’s house, saying, “Why do you look so sad
today?” <span class="bibleverse">8</span> They said to him, “We have

<p><span class="bibleverse">9</span> The chief cup bearer told his dream

branches. It was as though it budded, it blossomed, and its clusters
produced ripe grapes. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> Pharaoh’s cup
was in my hand; and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh’s
cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand.” <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> Joseph said to him, “This is its
interpretation: the three branches are three days. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> Within three more days, Pharaoh will lift
up your head, and restore you to your office. You will give Pharaoh’s
cup into his hand, the way you did when you were his cup bearer. <span

Please show kindness to me, and make mention of me to Pharaoh, and bring
me out of this house. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> For indeed, I

kinds of baked food for Pharaoh, and the birds ate them out of the
basket on my head.” <span class="bibleverse">18</span> Joseph answered,
“This is its interpretation. The three baskets are three days. <span

chief cup bearer to his position again, and he gave the cup into
Pharaoh’s hand; <span class="bibleverse">22</span> but he hanged the

them out of the river, ugly and thin, and stood by the other cattle on
the brink of the river. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> The ugly and
thin cattle ate up the seven sleek and fat cattle. So Pharaoh awoke.
<span class="bibleverse">5</span> He slept and dreamt a second time; and
behold, seven heads of grain came up on one stalk, healthy and good.
<span class="bibleverse">6</span> Behold, seven heads of grain, thin and
blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> The thin heads of grain swallowed up the
seven healthy and full ears. Pharaoh awoke, and behold, it was a dream.
<span class="bibleverse">8</span> In the morning, his spirit was
troubled, and he sent and called for all of Egypt’s magicians and wise
men. Pharaoh told them his dreams, but there was no one who could
interpret them to Pharaoh.</p>

put me in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, with the
chief baker. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> We dreamt a dream in one
night, he and I. Each man dreamt according to the interpretation of his
dream. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> There was with us there a
young man, a Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard, and we told
him, and he interpreted to us our dreams. He interpreted to each man
according to his dream. <span class="bibleverse">13</span> As he
interpreted to us, so it was. He restored me to my office, and he hanged
him.” <span class="bibleverse">14</span> Then Pharaoh sent and called

Pharaoh is one. What God is about to do he has declared to Pharaoh.
<span class="bibleverse">26</span> The seven good cattle are seven
years; and the seven good heads of grain are seven years. The dream is
one. <span class="bibleverse">27</span> The seven thin and ugly cattle
that came up after them are seven years, and also the seven empty heads
of grain blasted with the east wind; they will be seven years of famine.
<span class="bibleverse">28</span> That is the thing which I have spoken
to Pharaoh. God has shown Pharaoh what he is about to do. <span
class="bibleverse">29</span> Behold, seven years of great plenty
throughout all the land of Egypt are coming. <span
class="bibleverse">30</span> Seven years of famine will arise after
them, and all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of Egypt. The
famine will consume the land, <span class="bibleverse">31</span> and the
plenty will not be known in the land by reason of that famine which
follows; for it will be very grievous. <span
class="bibleverse">32</span> The dream was doubled to Pharaoh, because
the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to
pass.</p>
<h2 id="josephs-advice-for-pharaoh">Joseph's advice for Pharaoh</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">33</span> “Now therefore let Pharaoh look
for a discreet and wise man, and set him over the land of Egypt. <span
class="bibleverse">34</span> Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint
overseers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of
Egypt’s produce in the seven plenteous years. <span
class="bibleverse">35</span> Let them gather all the food of these good
years that come, and store grain under the hand of Pharaoh for food in
the cities, and let them keep it. <span class="bibleverse">36</span> The
food will be to supply the land against the seven years of famine, which
will be in the land of Egypt; so that the land will not perish through
the famine.”</p>
<h2 id="joseph-was-promoted-to-the-highest-official-in-the-state">Joseph
was promoted to the highest official in the state</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">37</span> The thing was good in the eyes of
Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants. <span
class="bibleverse">38</span> Pharaoh said to his servants, “Can we find
such a one as this, a man in whom is the Spirit of God?” <span
class="bibleverse">39</span> Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Because God has
shown you all of this, there is no one so discreet and wise as you.
<span class="bibleverse">40</span> You shall be over my house. All my
people will be ruled according to your word. Only in the throne I will
be greater than you.” <span class="bibleverse">41</span> Pharaoh said to
Joseph, “Behold, I have set you over all the land of Egypt.” <span
class="bibleverse">42</span> Pharaoh took off his signet ring from his
hand, and put it on Joseph’s hand, and arrayed him in robes of fine
linen, and put a gold chain about his neck. <span
class="bibleverse">43</span> He made him ride in the second chariot
which he had. They cried before him, “Bow the knee!” He set him over all
the land of Egypt. <span class="bibleverse">44</span> Pharaoh said to
Joseph, “I am Pharaoh. Without you, no man shall lift up his hand or his
foot in all the land of Egypt.” <span class="bibleverse">45</span>
Pharaoh called Joseph’s name Zaphenath-Paneah. He gave him Asenath, the
daughter of Potiphera priest of On as a wife. Joseph went out over the
land of Egypt.</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">46</span> Joseph was thirty years old when
he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. Joseph went out from the presence
of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt. <span
class="bibleverse">47</span> In the seven plenteous years the earth
produced abundantly. <span class="bibleverse">48</span> He gathered up
all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt, and
laid up the food in the cities. He stored food in each city from the
fields around that city. <span class="bibleverse">49</span> Joseph laid
up grain as the sand of the sea, very much, until he stopped counting,
for it was without number. <span class="bibleverse">50</span> To Joseph
were born two sons before the year of famine came, whom Asenath, the
daughter of Potiphera priest of On, bore to him. <span

Manasseh,<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"

<p><span class="bibleverse">53</span> The seven years of plenty, that
were in the land of Egypt, came to an end. <span
class="bibleverse">54</span> The seven years of famine began to come,
just as Joseph had said. There was famine in all lands, but in all the
land of Egypt there was bread. <span class="bibleverse">55</span> When
all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for
bread, and Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, “Go to Joseph. What he
says to you, do.” <span class="bibleverse">56</span> The famine was over
all the surface of the earth. Joseph opened all the store houses, and
sold to the Egyptians. The famine was severe in the land of Egypt. <span
class="bibleverse">57</span> All countries came into Egypt, to Joseph,
to buy grain, because the famine was severe in all the earth.</p>
<h1 id="section-41">42</h1>
<h2 id="jacobs-ten-eldest-sons-move-to-egypt-to-buy-grain">Jacob's ten
eldest sons move to Egypt to buy grain</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Now Jacob saw that there was grain
in Egypt, and Jacob said to his sons, “Why do you look at one another?”
<span class="bibleverse">2</span> He said, “Behold, I have heard that
there is grain in Egypt. Go down there, and buy for us from there, so
that we may live, and not die.” <span class="bibleverse">3</span>
Joseph’s ten brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt. <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> But Jacob didn’t send Benjamin, Joseph’s
brother, with his brothers; for he said, “Lest perhaps harm happen to
him.” <span class="bibleverse">5</span> The sons of Israel came to buy
amongst those who came, for the famine was in the land of Canaan.</p>
<h2 id="joses-first-tough-conversation-with-his-brothers">Jose's first
tough conversation with his brothers</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">6</span> Joseph was the governor over the
land. It was he who sold to all the people of the land. Joseph’s
brothers came, and bowed themselves down to him with their faces to the
earth. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> Joseph saw his brothers, and he
recognised them, but acted like a stranger to them, and spoke roughly
with them. He said to them, “Where did you come from?” They said, “From
the land of Canaan, to buy food.” <span class="bibleverse">8</span>
Joseph recognised his brothers, but they didn’t recognise him. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamt
about them, and said to them, “You are spies! You have come to see the
nakedness of the land.” <span class="bibleverse">10</span> They said to
him, “No, my lord, but your servants have come to buy food. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> We are all one man’s sons; we are honest
men. Your servants are not spies.” <span class="bibleverse">12</span> He
said to them, “No, but you have come to see the nakedness of the land!”
<span class="bibleverse">13</span> They said, “We, your servants, are
twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and behold,
the youngest is today with our father, and one is no more.” <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> Joseph said to them, “It is like I told
you, saying, ‘You are spies!’ <span class="bibleverse">15</span> By this
you shall be tested. By the life of Pharaoh, you shall not go out from
here, unless your youngest brother comes here. <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> Send one of you, and let him get your
brother, and you shall be bound, that your words may be tested, whether
there is truth in you, or else by the life of Pharaoh surely you are
spies.” <span class="bibleverse">17</span> He put them all together into
custody for three days.</p>
<h2 id="the-second-conversation-simeon-as-a-hostage">The second
conversation: Simeon as a hostage</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">18</span> Joseph said to them the third day,
“Do this, and live, for I fear God. <span class="bibleverse">19</span>
If you are honest men, then let one of your brothers be bound in your
prison; but you go, carry grain for the famine of your houses. <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> Bring your youngest brother to me; so will
your words be verified, and you won’t die.” They did so. <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> They said to one another, “We are certainly
guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the distress of his soul,
when he begged us, and we wouldn’t listen. Therefore this distress has
come upon us.” <span class="bibleverse">22</span> Reuben answered them,
saying, “Didn’t I tell you, saying, ‘Don’t sin against the child,’ and
you wouldn’t listen? Therefore also, behold, his blood is required.”
<span class="bibleverse">23</span> They didn’t know that Joseph
understood them; for there was an interpreter between them. <span
class="bibleverse">24</span> He turned himself away from them, and wept.
Then he returned to them, and spoke to them, and took Simeon from
amongst them, and bound him before their eyes.</p>
<h2 id="return-of-the-brothers-to-canaan">Return of the brothers to
Canaan</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">25</span> Then Joseph gave a command to fill
their bags with grain, and to restore each man’s money into his sack,
and to give them food for the way. So it was done to them. <span
class="bibleverse">26</span> They loaded their donkeys with their grain,
and departed from there. <span class="bibleverse">27</span> As one of
them opened his sack to give his donkey food in the lodging place, he
saw his money. Behold, it was in the mouth of his sack. <span
class="bibleverse">28</span> He said to his brothers, “My money is
restored! Behold, it is in my sack!” Their hearts failed them, and they
turned trembling to one another, saying, “What is this that God has done
to us?” <span class="bibleverse">29</span> They came to Jacob their
father, to the land of Canaan, and told him all that had happened to
them, saying, <span class="bibleverse">30</span> “The man, the lord of
the land, spoke roughly with us, and took us for spies of the country.
<span class="bibleverse">31</span> We said to him, ‘We are honest men.
We are no spies. <span class="bibleverse">32</span> We are twelve
brothers, sons of our father; one is no more, and the youngest is today
with our father in the land of Canaan.’ <span
class="bibleverse">33</span> The man, the lord of the land, said to us,
‘By this I will know that you are honest men: leave one of your brothers
with me, and take grain for the famine of your houses, and go your way.
<span class="bibleverse">34</span> Bring your youngest brother to me.
Then I will know that you are not spies, but that you are honest men. So
I will deliver your brother to you, and you shall trade in the land.’”
<span class="bibleverse">35</span> As they emptied their sacks, behold,
each man’s bundle of money was in his sack. When they and their father
saw their bundles of money, they were afraid. <span
class="bibleverse">36</span> Jacob, their father, said to them, “You
have bereaved me of my children! Joseph is no more, Simeon is no more,
and you want to take Benjamin away. All these things are against me.”
<span class="bibleverse">37</span> Reuben spoke to his father, saying,
“Kill my two sons, if I don’t bring him to you. Entrust him to my care,
and I will bring him to you again.” <span class="bibleverse">38</span>
He said, “My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead,
and he only is left. If harm happens to him along the way in which you
go, then you will bring down my grey hairs with sorrow to Sheol.”<a

journey of Joseph's brothers to Egypt with Benjamin</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> The famine was severe in the land.
<span class="bibleverse">2</span> When they had eaten up the grain which
they had brought out of Egypt, their father said to them, “Go again, buy
us a little more food.” <span class="bibleverse">3</span> Judah spoke to
him, saying, “The man solemnly warned us, saying, ‘You shall not see my
face, unless your brother is with you.’ <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> If you’ll send our brother with us, we’ll go
down and buy you food; <span class="bibleverse">5</span> but if you
don’t send him, we won’t go down, for the man said to us, ‘You shall not
see my face, unless your brother is with you.’” <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> Israel said, “Why did you treat me so badly,
telling the man that you had another brother?” <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> They said, “The man asked directly
concerning ourselves, and concerning our relatives, saying, ‘Is your
father still alive? Have you another brother?’ We just answered his
questions. Is there any way we could know that he would say, ‘Bring your
brother down?’” <span class="bibleverse">8</span> Judah said to Israel,
his father, “Send the boy with me, and we’ll get up and go, so that we
may live, and not die, both we, and you, and also our little ones. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> I’ll be collateral for him. From my hand
will you require him. If I don’t bring him to you, and set him before
you, then let me bear the blame forever; <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> for if we hadn’t delayed, surely we would
have returned a second time by now.” <span class="bibleverse">11</span>
Their father, Israel, said to them, “If it must be so, then do this:
Take from the choice fruits of the land in your bags, and carry down a
present for the man, a little balm, a little honey, spices and myrrh,
nuts, and almonds; <span class="bibleverse">12</span> and take double
money in your hand, and take back the money that was returned in the
mouth of your sacks. Perhaps it was an oversight. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> Take your brother also, get up, and return
to the man. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> May God Almighty give you
mercy before the man, that he may release to you your other brother and
Benjamin. If I am bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.” <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> The men took that present, and they took
double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and got up, went down to
Egypt, and stood before Joseph.</p>
<h2 id="friendly-welcome-by-josé-from-his-brothers">Friendly welcome by

<p><span class="bibleverse">16</span> When Joseph saw Benjamin with
them, he said to the steward of his house, “Bring the men into the
house, and butcher an animal, and prepare; for the men will dine with me
at noon.” <span class="bibleverse">17</span> The man did as Joseph
commanded, and the man brought the men to Joseph’s house. <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> The men were afraid, because they were
brought to Joseph’s house; and they said, “Because of the money that was
returned in our sacks the first time, we’re brought in; that he may seek
occasion against us, attack us, and seize us as slaves, along with our
donkeys.” <span class="bibleverse">19</span> They came near to the
steward of Joseph’s house, and they spoke to him at the door of the
house, <span class="bibleverse">20</span> and said, “Oh, my lord, we
indeed came down the first time to buy food. <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> When we came to the lodging place, we
opened our sacks, and behold, each man’s money was in the mouth of his
sack, our money in full weight. We have brought it back in our hand.
<span class="bibleverse">22</span> We have brought down other money in
our hand to buy food. We don’t know who put our money in our sacks.”
<span class="bibleverse">23</span> He said, “Peace be to you. Don’t be
afraid. Your God, and the God of your father, has given you treasure in
your sacks. I received your money.” He brought Simeon out to them. <span
class="bibleverse">24</span> The man brought the men into Joseph’s
house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet. He gave their
donkeys fodder. <span class="bibleverse">25</span> They prepared the
present for Joseph’s coming at noon, for they heard that they should eat
bread there.</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">26</span> When Joseph came home, they
brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and
bowed themselves down to the earth before him. <span
class="bibleverse">27</span> He asked them of their welfare, and said,
“Is your father well, the old man of whom you spoke? Is he yet alive?”
<span class="bibleverse">28</span> They said, “Your servant, our father,
is well. He is still alive.” They bowed down humbly. <span
class="bibleverse">29</span> He lifted up his eyes, and saw Benjamin,
his brother, his mother’s son, and said, “Is this your youngest brother,
of whom you spoke to me?” He said, “God be gracious to you, my son.”
<span class="bibleverse">30</span> Joseph hurried, for his heart yearned
over his brother; and he sought a place to weep. He entered into his
room, and wept there. <span class="bibleverse">31</span> He washed his
face, and came out. He controlled himself, and said, “Serve the meal.”
<span class="bibleverse">32</span> They served him by himself, and them
by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves, because
the Egyptians don’t eat with the Hebrews, for that is an abomination to
the Egyptians. <span class="bibleverse">33</span> They sat before him,
the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to
his youth, and the men marvelled with one another. <span
class="bibleverse">34</span> He sent portions to them from before him,
but Benjamin’s portion was five times as much as any of theirs. They
drank, and were merry with him.</p>

<h2 id="josé-is-testing-his-brothers-one-last-time">José is testing his

<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> He commanded the steward of his
house, saying, “Fill the men’s sacks with food, as much as they can
carry, and put each man’s money in his sack’s mouth. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> Put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack’s
mouth of the youngest, with his grain money.” He did according to the
word that Joseph had spoken. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> As soon
as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their
donkeys. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> When they had gone out of the
city, and were not yet far off, Joseph said to his steward, “Up, follow
after the men. When you overtake them, ask them, ‘Why have you rewarded
evil for good? <span class="bibleverse">5</span> Isn’t this that from
which my lord drinks, and by which he indeed divines? You have done evil
in so doing.’” <span class="bibleverse">6</span> He overtook them, and
he spoke these words to them. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> They
said to him, “Why does my lord speak such words as these? Far be it from
your servants that they should do such a thing! <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> Behold, the money, which we found in our
sacks’ mouths, we brought again to you out of the land of Canaan. How
then should we steal silver or gold out of your lord’s house? <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> With whomever of your servants it is found,
let him die, and we also will be my lord’s slaves.” <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> He said, “Now also let it be according to
your words. He with whom it is found will be my slave; and you will be
blameless.” <span class="bibleverse">11</span> Then they hurried, and
each man took his sack down to the ground, and each man opened his sack.
<span class="bibleverse">12</span> He searched, beginning with the
oldest, and ending at the youngest. The cup was found in Benjamin’s
sack. <span class="bibleverse">13</span> Then they tore their clothes,
and each man loaded his donkey, and returned to the city.</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">14</span> Judah and his brothers came to

him. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> Joseph said to them, “What deed
is this that you have done? Don’t you know that such a man as I can
indeed do divination?” <span class="bibleverse">16</span> Judah said,
“What will we tell my lord? What will we speak? How will we clear
ourselves? God has found out the iniquity of your servants. Behold, we
are my lord’s slaves, both we and he also in whose hand the cup is
found.” <span class="bibleverse">17</span> He said, “Far be it from me
that I should do so. The man in whose hand the cup is found, he will be
my slave; but as for you, go up in peace to your father.” <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> Then Judah came near to him, and said, “Oh,
my lord, please let your servant speak a word in my lord’s ears, and
don’t let your anger burn against your servant; for you are even as
Pharaoh. <span class="bibleverse">19</span> My lord asked his servants,
saying, ‘Have you a father, or a brother?’ <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> We said to my lord, ‘We have a father, an
old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is
dead, and he alone is left of his mother; and his father loves him.’
<span class="bibleverse">21</span> You said to your servants, ‘Bring him
down to me, that I may set my eyes on him.’ <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> We said to my lord, ‘The boy can’t leave
his father, for if he should leave his father, his father would die.’
<span class="bibleverse">23</span> You said to your servants, ‘Unless
your youngest brother comes down with you, you will see my face no
more.’ <span class="bibleverse">24</span> When we came up to your
servant my father, we told him the words of my lord. <span
class="bibleverse">25</span> Our father said, ‘Go again and buy us a
little food.’ <span class="bibleverse">26</span> We said, ‘We can’t go
down. If our youngest brother is with us, then we will go down: for we
may not see the man’s face, unless our youngest brother is with us.’
<span class="bibleverse">27</span> Your servant, my father, said to us,
‘You know that my wife bore me two sons. <span
class="bibleverse">28</span> One went out from me, and I said, “Surely
he is torn in pieces;” and I haven’t seen him since. <span
class="bibleverse">29</span> If you take this one also from me, and harm

instead of the boy, my lord’s slave; and let the boy go up with his

<h1 id="section-44">45</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Then Joseph couldn’t control
himself before all those who stood before him, and he called out, “Cause
everyone to go out from me!” No one else stood with him, while Joseph
made himself known to his brothers. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> He
wept aloud. The Egyptians heard, and the house of Pharaoh heard. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> Joseph said to his brothers, “I am Joseph!
Does my father still live?” His brothers couldn’t answer him; for they
were terrified at his presence. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> Joseph
said to his brothers, “Come near to me, please.” They came near. He
said, “I am Joseph, your brother, whom you sold into Egypt. <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> Now don’t be grieved, nor angry with
yourselves, that you sold me here, for God sent me before you to
preserve life. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> For these two years the
famine has been in the land, and there are yet five years, in which
there will be no ploughing and no harvest. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> God sent me before you to preserve for you a
remnant in the earth, and to save you alive by a great deliverance.
<span class="bibleverse">8</span> So now it wasn’t you who sent me here,
but God, and he has made me a father to Pharaoh, lord of all his house,
and ruler over all the land of Egypt. <span class="bibleverse">9</span>
Hurry, and go up to my father, and tell him, ‘This is what your son
Joseph says, “God has made me lord of all Egypt. Come down to me. Don’t
wait. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> You shall dwell in the land of
Goshen, and you will be near to me, you, your children, your children’s
children, your flocks, your herds, and all that you have. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> There I will provide for you; for there are
yet five years of famine; lest you come to poverty, you, and your
household, and all that you have.”’ <span class="bibleverse">12</span>
Behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is
my mouth that speaks to you. <span class="bibleverse">13</span> You
shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that you have
seen. You shall hurry and bring my father down here.” <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> He fell on his brother Benjamin’s neck and
wept, and Benjamin wept on his neck. <span class="bibleverse">15</span>
He kissed all his brothers, and wept on them. After that his brothers
talked with him. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> The report of it was
heard in Pharaoh’s house, saying, “Joseph’s brothers have come.” It
pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants. <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Tell your
brothers, ‘Do this: Load your animals, and go, travel to the land of
Canaan. <span class="bibleverse">18</span> Take your father and your
households, and come to me, and I will give you the good of the land of
Egypt, and you will eat the fat of the land.’ <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> Now you are commanded to do this: Take
wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your
wives, and bring your father, and come. <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> Also, don’t concern yourselves about your
belongings, for the good of all the land of Egypt is yours.” <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> The sons of Israel did so. Joseph gave them
wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision
for the way. <span class="bibleverse">22</span> He gave each one of them
changes of clothing, but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of
silver and five changes of clothing. <span class="bibleverse">23</span>
He sent the following to his father: ten donkeys loaded with the good
things of Egypt, and ten female donkeys loaded with grain and bread and
provision for his father by the way. <span class="bibleverse">24</span>
So he sent his brothers away, and they departed. He said to them, “See
that you don’t quarrel on the way.” <span class="bibleverse">25</span>
They went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan, to Jacob
their father. <span class="bibleverse">26</span> They told him, saying,
“Joseph is still alive, and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt.” His
heart fainted, for he didn’t believe them. <span
class="bibleverse">27</span> They told him all the words of Joseph,
which he had said to them. When he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent
to carry him, the spirit of Jacob, their father, revived. <span
class="bibleverse">28</span> Israel said, “It is enough. Joseph my son
is still alive. I will go and see him before I die.”</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Israel travelled with all that he

the visions of the night, and said, “Jacob, Jacob!” He said, “Here I

Jacob rose up from Beersheba, and the sons of Israel carried Jacob,

<p><span class="bibleverse">28</span> Jacob sent Judah before him to

land of Goshen. <span class="bibleverse">29</span> Joseph prepared his
chariot, and went up to meet Israel, his father, in Goshen. He presented
himself to him, and fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while.
<span class="bibleverse">30</span> Israel said to Joseph, “Now let me
die, since I have seen your face, that you are still alive.” <span

father’s house, “I will go up, and speak with Pharaoh, and will tell
him, ‘My brothers, and my father’s house, who were in the land of
Canaan, have come to me. <span class="bibleverse">32</span> These men
are shepherds, for they have been keepers of livestock, and they have

behold, they are in the land of Goshen.” <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> From amongst his brothers he took five men,

said to his brothers, “What is your occupation?” They said to Pharaoh,
“Your servants are shepherds, both we, and our fathers.” <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> They also said to Pharaoh, “We have come to

servants’ flocks. For the famine is severe in the land of Canaan. Now
therefore, please let your servants dwell in the land of Goshen.” <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, saying, “Your
father and your brothers have come to you. <span

<p><span class="bibleverse">7</span> Joseph brought in Jacob, his

<span class="bibleverse">9</span> Jacob said to Pharaoh, “The years of
my pilgrimage are one hundred and thirty years. The days of the years of
my life have been few and evil. They have not attained to the days of
the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.”
<span class="bibleverse">10</span> Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out
from the presence of Pharaoh. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> Joseph
placed his father and his brothers, and gave them a possession in the
land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as
Pharaoh had commanded. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> Joseph
provided his father, his brothers, and all of his father’s household
with bread, according to the sizes of their families.</p>
<h2 id="joseph-buys-the-land-for-pharaoh">Joseph buys the land for
Pharaoh</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">13</span> There was no bread in all the
land; for the famine was very severe, so that the land of Egypt and the
land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> Joseph gathered up all the money that was
found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the grain
which they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh’s house.
<span class="bibleverse">15</span> When the money was all spent in the
land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to
Joseph, and said, “Give us bread, for why should we die in your
presence? For our money fails.” <span class="bibleverse">16</span>
Joseph said, “Give me your livestock; and I will give you food for your
livestock, if your money is gone.” <span class="bibleverse">17</span>
They brought their livestock to Joseph, and Joseph gave them bread in
exchange for the horses, and for the flocks, and for the herds, and for
the donkeys: and he fed them with bread in exchange for all their
livestock for that year. <span class="bibleverse">18</span> When that
year was ended, they came to him the second year, and said to him, “We
will not hide from my lord how our money is all spent, and the herds of
livestock are my lord’s. There is nothing left in the sight of my lord,
but our bodies, and our lands. <span class="bibleverse">19</span> Why
should we die before your eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our
land for bread, and we and our land will be servants to Pharaoh. Give us
seed, that we may live, and not die, and that the land won’t be
desolate.” <span class="bibleverse">20</span> So Joseph bought all the
land of Egypt for Pharaoh, for every man of the Egyptians sold his
field, because the famine was severe on them, and the land became
Pharaoh’s. <span class="bibleverse">21</span> As for the people, he
moved them to the cities from one end of the border of Egypt even to the
other end of it. <span class="bibleverse">22</span> Only he didn’t buy
the land of the priests, for the priests had a portion from Pharaoh, and
ate their portion which Pharaoh gave them. That is why they didn’t sell
their land. <span class="bibleverse">23</span> Then Joseph said to the
people, “Behold, I have bought you and your land today for Pharaoh.
Behold, here is seed for you, and you shall sow the land. <span
class="bibleverse">24</span> It will happen at the harvests, that you
shall give a fifth to Pharaoh, and four parts will be your own, for seed
of the field, for your food, for them of your households, and for food
for your little ones.” <span class="bibleverse">25</span> They said,
“You have saved our lives! Let us find favour in the sight of my lord,
and we will be Pharaoh’s servants.” <span class="bibleverse">26</span>
Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt to this day, that
Pharaoh should have the fifth. Only the land of the priests alone didn’t
become Pharaoh’s.</p>

years. So the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were one hundred and
forty-seven years. <span class="bibleverse">29</span> The time came near
that Israel must die, and he called his son Joseph, and said to him, “If
now I have found favour in your sight, please put your hand under my
thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me. Please don’t bury me in Egypt,
<span class="bibleverse">30</span> but when I sleep with my fathers, you
shall carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their burying place.” Joseph
said, “I will do as you have said.” <span class="bibleverse">31</span>
Israel said, “Swear to me,” and he swore to him. Then Israel bowed

<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> After these things, someone said to

Jacob, and said, “Behold, your son Joseph comes to you,” and Israel
strengthened himself, and sat on the bed. <span

fruitful, and multiply you, and I will make of you a company of peoples,
and will give this land to your offspring after you for an everlasting
possession.’ <span class="bibleverse">5</span> Now your two sons, who
were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you into Egypt,
are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh, even as Reuben and Simeon, will be mine.
<span class="bibleverse">6</span> Your offspring, whom you become the
father of after them, will be yours. They will be called after the name
of their brothers in their inheritance. <span

<p><span class="bibleverse">8</span> Israel saw Joseph’s sons, and said,

bring them to me, and I will bless them.” <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so
that he couldn’t see well. Joseph brought them near to him; and he
kissed them, and embraced them. <span class="bibleverse">11</span>
Israel said to Joseph, “I didn’t think I would see your face, and
behold, God has let me see your offspring also.” <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> Joseph brought them out from between his
knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right
hand towards Israel’s left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand towards
Israel’s right hand, and brought them near to him. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> Israel stretched out his right hand, and
laid it on Ephraim’s head, who was the younger, and his left hand on
Manasseh’s head, guiding his hands knowingly, for Manasseh was the
firstborn. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> He blessed Joseph, and
said, “The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, the God
who has fed me all my life long to this day, <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> the angel who has redeemed me from all
evil, bless the lads, and let my name be named on them, and the name of
my fathers Abraham and Isaac. Let them grow into a multitude upon the
earth.” <span class="bibleverse">17</span> When Joseph saw that his
father laid his right hand on the head of Ephraim, it displeased him. He
held up his father’s hand, to remove it from Ephraim’s head to
Manasseh’s head. <span class="bibleverse">18</span> Joseph said to his
father, “Not so, my father, for this is the firstborn. Put your right
hand on his head.” <span class="bibleverse">19</span> His father
refused, and said, “I know, my son, I know. He also will become a
people, and he also will be great. However, his younger brother will be
greater than he, and his offspring will become a multitude of nations.”
<span class="bibleverse">20</span> He blessed them that day, saying,
“Israel will bless in you, saying, ‘God make you as Ephraim and as
Manasseh’” He set Ephraim before Manasseh. <span

but God will be with you, and bring you again to the land of your
fathers. <span class="bibleverse">22</span> Moreover I have given to you

him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, all
the elders of the land of Egypt, <span class="bibleverse">8</span> all

little ones, their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of

His sons did to him just as he commanded them, <span

Abraham bought with the field, as a possession for a burial site, from

brothers, “I am dying, but God will surely visit you, and bring you up
out of this land to the land which he swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to
Jacob.” <span class="bibleverse">25</span> Joseph took an oath from the
children of Israel, saying, “God will surely visit you, and you shall
carry up my bones from here.” <span class="bibleverse">26</span> So
Joseph died, being one hundred and ten years old, and they embalmed him,
and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.</p>
