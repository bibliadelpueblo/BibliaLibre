earth, and all that is therein. Let the Lord<a href="#fn2"

poured down a steep place. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> “All this
is for the disobedience of Jacob, and for the sins of the house of
Israel. What is the disobedience of Jacob? Isn’t it Samaria? And what
are the high places of Judah? Aren’t they Jerusalem?</p>

Samaria</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">6</span> Therefore I will make Samaria like

will pour down its stones into the valley, and I will uncover its
foundations. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> All her idols will be
beaten to pieces, all her temple gifts will be burnt with fire, and I

class="bibleverse">2</span> They covet fields and seize them, and
houses, then take them away. They oppress a man and his house, even a
man and his heritage. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> Therefore the

these people a disaster, from which you will not remove your necks,
neither will you walk haughtily, for it is an evil time. <span

doings? Don’t my words do good to him who walks blamelessly?” <span

<p><span class="bibleverse">9</span> Please listen to this, you heads of

build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity. <span

say, “Isn’t the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> amongst us? No
disaster will come on us.” <span class="bibleverse">12</span> Therefore
Zion for your sake will be ploughed like a field, and Jerusalem will
become heaps of rubble, and the mountain of the temple like the high
places of a forest.</p>
<h1 id="section-3">4</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> But in the latter days, it will
happen that the mountain of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s
temple will be established on the top of the mountains, and it will be
exalted above the hills; and peoples will stream to it. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> Many nations will go and say, “Come! Let’s
go up to the mountain of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and to
the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we
will walk in his paths.” For the law will go out of Zion, and the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s word from Jerusalem; <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> and he will judge between many peoples, and
will decide concerning strong nations afar off. They will beat their
swords into ploughshares, and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation
will not lift up sword against nation, neither will they learn war any
more. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> But every man will sit under his
vine and under his fig tree. No one will make them afraid, for the mouth
of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> of Armies has spoken. <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> Indeed all the nations may walk in the name
of their gods, but we will walk in the name of the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> our God forever and ever. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> “In that day,” says the <span

I will gather that which is driven away, and that which I have
afflicted; <span class="bibleverse">7</span> and I will make that which
was lame a remnant, and that which was cast far off a strong nation: and
the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> will reign over them on Mount
Zion from then on, even forever.” <span class="bibleverse">8</span> You,
tower of the flock, the hill of the daughter of Zion, to you it will
come. Yes, the former dominion will come, the kingdom of the daughter of
Jerusalem. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> Now why do you cry out
aloud? Is there no king in you? Has your counsellor perished, that pains
have taken hold of you as of a woman in travail? <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> Be in pain, and labour to give birth,
daughter of Zion, like a woman in travail; for now you will go out of
the city, and will dwell in the field, and will come even to Babylon.
There you will be rescued. There the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>
will redeem you from the hand of your enemies. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> Now many nations have assembled against
you, that say, “Let her be defiled, and let our eye gloat over Zion.”
<span class="bibleverse">12</span> But they don’t know the thoughts of
the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, neither do they understand his
counsel; for he has gathered them like the sheaves to the threshing
floor. <span class="bibleverse">13</span> Arise and thresh, daughter of
Zion, for I will make your horn iron, and I will make your hoofs bronze.
You will beat in pieces many peoples. I will devote their gain to the
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and their substance to the Lord of
the whole earth.</p>
<h1 id="section-4">5</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Now you shall gather yourself in
troops, daughter of troops. He has laid siege against us. They will
strike the judge of Israel with a rod on the cheek. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, being small
amongst the clans of Judah, out of you one will come out to me who is to
be ruler in Israel; whose goings out are from of old, from ancient
times. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> Therefore he will abandon them
until the time that she who is in labour gives birth. Then the rest of
his brothers will return to the children of Israel. <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> He shall stand, and shall shepherd in the
strength of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, in the majesty of
the name of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> his God. They will
live, for then he will be great to the ends of the earth. <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> He will be our peace when Assyria invades
our land and when he marches through our fortresses, then we will raise
against him seven shepherds, and eight leaders of men. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> They will rule the land of Assyria with the
sword, and the land of Nimrod in its gates. He will deliver us from the
Assyrian, when he invades our land, and when he marches within our
border. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> The remnant of Jacob will be
amongst many peoples like dew from the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, like showers on the grass, that don’t
wait for man nor wait for the sons of men. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> The remnant of Jacob will be amongst the
nations, amongst many peoples, like a lion amongst the animals of the
forest, like a young lion amongst the flocks of sheep; who, if he goes
through, treads down and tears in pieces, and there is no one to
deliver. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> Let your hand be lifted up
above your adversaries, and let all of your enemies be cut off. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> “It will happen in that day”, says the
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, “that I will cut off your horses
from amongst you and will destroy your chariots. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> I will cut off the cities of your land and
will tear down all your strongholds. <span class="bibleverse">12</span>
I will destroy witchcraft from your hand. You shall have no soothsayers.
<span class="bibleverse">13</span> I will cut off your engraved images
and your pillars from amongst you; and you shall no more worship the
work of your hands. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> I will uproot
your Asherah poles from amongst you; and I will destroy your cities.
<span class="bibleverse">15</span> I will execute vengeance in anger and
wrath on the nations that didn’t listen.”</p>
<h1 id="section-5">6</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Listen now to what the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> says: “Arise, plead your case before the
mountains, and let the hills hear what you have to say. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> Hear, you mountains, the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s indictment, and you enduring foundations
of the earth; for the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> has a case
against his people, and he will contend with Israel. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> My people, what have I done to you? How have
I burdened you? Answer me! <span class="bibleverse">4</span> For I
brought you up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed you out of the
house of bondage. I sent before you Moses, Aaron, and Miriam. <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> My people, remember now what Balak king of
Moab devised, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him from Shittim
to Gilgal, that you may know the righteous acts of the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>.” <span class="bibleverse">6</span> How
shall I come before the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and bow
myself before the exalted God? Shall I come before him with burnt
offerings, with calves a year old? <span class="bibleverse">7</span>
Will the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> be pleased with thousands
of rams? With tens of thousands of rivers of oil? Shall I give my
firstborn for my disobedience? The fruit of my body for the sin of my
soul? <span class="bibleverse">8</span> He has shown you, O man, what is
good. What does the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> require of you,
but to act justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God?
<span class="bibleverse">9</span> The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s voice calls to the city— and wisdom
fears your name— “Listen to the rod, and he who appointed it. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> Are there yet treasures of wickedness in
the house of the wicked, and a short ephah<a href="#fn6"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>
that is accursed? <span class="bibleverse">11</span> Shall I tolerate
dishonest scales, and a bag of deceitful weights? <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> Her rich men are full of violence, her
inhabitants speak lies, and their tongue is deceitful in their speech.
<span class="bibleverse">13</span> Therefore I also have struck you with
a grievous wound. I have made you desolate because of your sins. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> You shall eat, but not be satisfied. Your
hunger will be within you. You will store up, but not save, and that
which you save I will give up to the sword. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> You will sow, but won’t reap. You will
tread the olives, but won’t anoint yourself with oil; and crush grapes,
but won’t drink the wine. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> For the
statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of Ahab’s house. You walk
in their counsels, that I may make you a ruin, and your inhabitants a
hissing. You will bear the reproach of my people.”</p>
<h1 id="section-6">7</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Misery is mine! Indeed, I am like
one who gathers the summer fruits, as gleanings of the vineyard. There
is no cluster of grapes to eat. My soul desires to eat the early fig.
<span class="bibleverse">2</span> The godly man has perished out of the
earth, and there is no one upright amongst men. They all lie in wait for
blood; every man hunts his brother with a net. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> Their hands are on that which is evil to do
it diligently. The ruler and judge ask for a bribe. The powerful man
dictates the evil desire of his soul. Thus they conspire together. <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> The best of them is like a brier. The most
upright is worse than a thorn hedge. The day of your watchmen, even your
visitation, has come; now is the time of their confusion. <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> Don’t trust in a neighbour. Don’t put
confidence in a friend. With the woman lying in your embrace, be careful
of the words of your mouth! <span class="bibleverse">6</span> For the
son dishonours the father, the daughter rises up against her mother, the
daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; a man’s enemies are the men
of his own house. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> But as for me, I
will look to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. I will wait for
the God of my salvation. My God will hear me. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> Don’t rejoice against me, my enemy. When I
fall, I will arise. When I sit in darkness, the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> will be a light to me. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> I will bear the indignation of the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, because I have sinned against him, until
he pleads my case and executes judgement for me. He will bring me out to
the light. I will see his righteousness. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> Then my enemy will see it, and shame will
cover her who said to me, “Where is the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> your God?” My eyes will see her. Now she
will be trodden down like the mire of the streets. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> A day to build your walls! In that day, he
will extend your boundary. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> In that
day they will come to you from Assyria and the cities of Egypt, and from
Egypt even to the River, and from sea to sea, and mountain to mountain.
<span class="bibleverse">13</span> Yet the land will be desolate because
of those who dwell therein, for the fruit of their doings. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> Shepherd your people with your staff, the
flock of your heritage, who dwell by themselves in a forest. Let them
feed in the middle of fertile pasture land, in Bashan and Gilead, as in
the days of old. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> “As in the days of
your coming out of the land of Egypt, I will show them marvellous
things.” <span class="bibleverse">16</span> The nations will see and be
ashamed of all their might. They will lay their hand on their mouth.
Their ears will be deaf. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> They will
lick the dust like a serpent. Like crawling things of the earth, they
will come trembling out of their dens. They will come with fear to the
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> our God, and will be afraid because
of you.</p>
