love for Israel in contrast to his treatment of the sister nation of
Edom</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> A revelation, the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> word to Israel by
Malachi. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> “I have loved you,” says the
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. Yet you say, “How have you loved
us?” “Wasn’t Esau Jacob’s brother?” says the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, “Yet I loved Jacob; <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> but Esau I hated, and made his mountains a
desolation, and gave his heritage to the jackals of the wilderness.”
<span class="bibleverse">4</span> Whereas Edom says, “We are beaten
down, but we will return and build the waste places,” the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> of Armies says, “They shall build, but I
will throw down; and men will call them ‘The Wicked Land,’ even the
people against whom the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> shows wrath
forever.” <span class="bibleverse">5</span> Your eyes will see, and you
will say, “The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is great—even beyond
the border of Israel!”</p>
<h2

of lack of love and neglect of priesthood duty to God</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">6</span> “A son honours his father, and a
servant his master. If I am a father, then where is my honour? And if I
am a master, where is the respect due me?” says the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> of Armies to you priests who despise my
name. “You say, ‘How have we despised your name?’ <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> You offer polluted bread on my altar. You
say, ‘How have we polluted you?’ In that you say, ‘The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s table is contemptible.’ <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> When you offer the blind for sacrifice,
isn’t that evil? And when you offer the lame and sick, isn’t that evil?
Present it now to your governor! Will he be pleased with you? Or will he
accept your person?” says the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> of
Armies. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> “Now, please entreat the
favour of God,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> that he may be gracious to us. With
this, will he accept any of you?” says the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> of Armies. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> “Oh that there were one amongst you who
would shut the doors, that you might not kindle fire on my altar in
vain! I have no pleasure in you,” says the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> of Armies, “neither will I accept an
offering at your hand. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> For from the
rising of the sun even to its going down, my name is great amongst the
nations, and in every place incense will be offered to my name, and a
pure offering; for my name is great amongst the nations,” says the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> of Armies. <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> “But you profane it when you say, ‘The
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s table is polluted, and its fruit,
even its food, is contemptible.’ <span class="bibleverse">13</span> You
say also, ‘Behold,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> what a weariness it is!’ And you
have sniffed at it”, says the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> of
Armies; “and you have brought that which was taken by violence, the
lame, and the sick; thus you bring the offering. Should I accept this at
your hand?” says the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> “But the deceiver is cursed who has in his
flock a male, and vows and sacrifices to the Lord<a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> a
defective thing; for I am a great King,” says the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> of Armies, “and my name is awesome amongst
the nations.”</p>

and threat of punishment to priests; Levi then and now</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> “Now, you priests, this commandment
is for you. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> If you will not listen,
and if you will not take it to heart, to give glory to my name,” says
the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> of Armies, “then I will send the
curse on you, and I will curse your blessings. Indeed, I have cursed
them already, because you do not take it to heart. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> Behold, I will rebuke your offspring,<a
href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> and will spread dung on your faces,
even the dung of your feasts; and you will be taken away with it. <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> You will know that I have sent this
commandment to you, that my covenant may be with Levi,” says the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> of Armies. <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> “My covenant was with him of life and peace;
and I gave them to him that he might be reverent towards me; and he was
reverent towards me, and stood in awe of my name. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> The law of truth was in his mouth, and
unrighteousness was not found in his lips. He walked with me in peace
and uprightness, and turned many away from iniquity. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> For the priest’s lips should keep knowledge,
and they should seek the law at his mouth; for he is the messenger of
the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> of Armies. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> But you have turned away from the path. You
have caused many to stumble in the law. You have corrupted the covenant
of Levi,” says the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> of Armies. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> “Therefore I have also made you contemptible
and wicked before all the people, according to the way you have not kept
my ways, but have had respect for persons in the law.</p>

marriages with foreign women and against divorces; Marriage fidelity
reminder</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">10</span> Don’t we all have one father?
Hasn’t one God created us? Why do we deal treacherously every man
against his brother, profaning the covenant of our fathers? <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> Judah has dealt treacherously, and an
abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah has
profaned the holiness of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> which
he loves, and has married the daughter of a foreign god. <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>
will cut off the man who does this, him who wakes and him who answers,
out of the tents of Jacob and him who offers an offering to the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> of Armies. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> “This again you do: you cover the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s altar with tears, with weeping, and with
sighing, because he doesn’t regard the offering any more, neither
receives it with good will at your hand. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> Yet you say, ‘Why?’ Because the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> has been witness between you and the wife
of your youth, against whom you have dealt treacherously, though she is
your companion and the wife of your covenant. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> Did he not make you one, although he had
the residue of the Spirit? Why one? He sought godly offspring. Therefore
take heed to your spirit, and let no one deal treacherously against the
wife of his youth. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> One who hates and
divorces”, says the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the God of
Israel, “covers his garment with violence!” says the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> of Armies. “Therefore pay attention to
your spirit, that you don’t be unfaithful.</p>

those who doubt the justice of God; Description of the Course of
Infallible Judgment</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">17</span> You have wearied the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> with your words. Yet you say, ‘How have we
wearied him?’ In that you say, ‘Everyone who does evil is good in the
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s sight, and he delights in them;’
or ‘Where is the God of justice?’</p>
<h1 id="section-2">3</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> “Behold, I send my messenger, and
he will prepare the way before me! The Lord, whom you seek, will
suddenly come to his temple. Behold, the messenger of the covenant, whom
you desire, is coming!” says the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> of
Armies. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> “But who can endure the day of
his coming? And who will stand when he appears? For he is like a
refiner’s fire, and like launderers’ soap; <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> and he will sit as a refiner and purifier of
silver, and he will purify the sons of Levi, and refine them as gold and
silver; and they shall offer to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>
offerings in righteousness. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> Then the
offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasant to the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> as in the days of old and as in ancient
years. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> I will come near to you to
judgement. I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, against the
adulterers, against the perjurers, and against those who oppress the
hireling in his wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and who deprive
the foreigner of justice, and don’t fear me,” says the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> of Armies.</p>
<h2

current bad situation is self-inflicted through multiple crimes</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">6</span> “For I, the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, don’t change; therefore you, sons of
Jacob, are not consumed. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> From the days
of your fathers you have turned away from my ordinances and have not
kept them. Return to me, and I will return to you,” says the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> of Armies. “But you say, ‘How shall we
return?’ <span class="bibleverse">8</span> Will a man rob God? Yet you
rob me! But you say, ‘How have we robbed you?’ In tithes and offerings.
<span class="bibleverse">9</span> You are cursed with the curse; for you
rob me, even this whole nation. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> Bring
the whole tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house,
and test me now in this,” says the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>
of Armies, “if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you
out a blessing, that there will not be enough room for. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes,
and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your
vine cast its fruit before its time in the field,” says the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> of Armies. <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> “All nations shall call you blessed, for
you will be a delightful land,” says the <span

and correction of the pious discontented and doubtful; consoling promise
to the righteous</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">13</span> “Your words have been harsh
against me,” says the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. “Yet you say,
‘What have we spoken against you?’ <span class="bibleverse">14</span>
You have said, ‘It is vain to serve God,’ and ‘What profit is it that we
have followed his instructions and that we have walked mournfully before
the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> of Armies? <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> Now we call the proud happy; yes, those who
work wickedness are built up; yes, they tempt God, and escape.’ <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> Then those who feared the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> spoke one with another; and the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> listened and heard, and a book of memory
was written before him for those who feared the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> and who honoured his name. <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> They shall be mine,” says the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> of Armies, “my own possession in the day
that I make. I will spare them, as a man spares his own son who serves
him. <span class="bibleverse">18</span> Then you shall return and
discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him who serves God
and him who doesn’t serve him.</p>
<h1 id="section-3">4</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> “For behold, the day comes, burning
like a furnace, when all the proud and all who work wickedness will be
stubble. The day that comes will burn them up,” says the <span

neither root nor branch. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> But to you
who fear my name shall the sun of righteousness arise with healing in
its wings. You will go out and leap like calves of the stall. <span

will be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I make,” says
the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> of Armies.</p>
