will never forget any of their works. <span class="bibleverse">8</span>
Won’t the land tremble for this, and everyone mourn who dwells in it?
Yes, it will rise up wholly like the River; and it will be stirred up
and sink again, like the River of Egypt.</p>

of divine punishments, solar eclipses, mourning, abandoned by God in
dire need</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">9</span> It will happen in that day,” says
the Lord GOD, “that I will cause the sun to go down at noon, and I will
darken the earth in the clear day. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> I
will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into
lamentation; and I will make you wear sackcloth on all your bodies, and
baldness on every head. I will make it like the mourning for an only
son, and its end like a bitter day. <span class="bibleverse">11</span>
Behold, the days come,” says the Lord GOD, “that I will send a famine in
the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing
the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s words. <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> They will wander from sea to sea, and from
the north even to the east; they will run back and forth to seek the
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s word, and will not find it. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> In that day the beautiful virgins and the
young men will faint for thirst. <span class="bibleverse">14</span>
Those who swear by the sin of Samaria, and say, ‘As your god, Dan,
lives,’ and, ‘As the way of Beersheba lives,’ they will fall, and never
rise up again.”</p>

Lord at the altar, regarding the destruction of the sanctuary at Bethel
and the inescapability of the coming judgment</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> I saw the Lord standing beside the
altar, and he said, “Strike the tops of the pillars, that the thresholds
may shake. Break them in pieces on the head of all of them. I will kill
the last of them with the sword. Not one of them will flee away. Not one
of them will escape. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> Though they dig
into Sheol,<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> there my hand will take them; and
though they climb up to heaven, there I will bring them down. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> Though they hide themselves in the top of
Carmel, I will search and take them out from there; and though they be
hidden from my sight in the bottom of the sea, there I will command the
serpent, and it will bite them. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> Though
they go into captivity before their enemies, there I will command the
sword, and it will kill them. I will set my eyes on them for evil, and
not for good. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> For the Lord, the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> of Armies, is he who touches the land and
it melts, and all who dwell in it will mourn; and it will rise up wholly
like the River, and will sink again, like the River of Egypt. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> It is he who builds his rooms in the
heavens, and has founded his vault on the earth; he who calls for the
waters of the sea, and pours them out on the surface of the earth—the
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is his name. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> Are you not like the children of the
Ethiopians to me, children of Israel?” says the <span

land of Egypt, and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from
Kir?</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">8</span> Behold, the eyes of the Lord GOD
are on the sinful kingdom, and I will destroy it from off the surface of
the earth, except that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob,”
says the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> “For behold, I will command, and I will sift
the house of Israel amongst all the nations as grain is sifted in a
sieve, yet not the least kernel will fall on the earth. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> All the sinners of my people will die by
the sword, who say, ‘Evil won’t overtake nor meet us.’ <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> In that day I will raise up the tent of
David who is fallen and close up its breaches, and I will raise up its
ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old, <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> that they may possess the remnant of Edom
and all the nations who are called by my name,” says the <span

<p><span class="bibleverse">13</span> “Behold, the days come,” says the

the reaper, and the one treading grapes him who sows seed; and sweet
wine will drip from the mountains, and flow from the hills. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> I will bring my people Israel back from
captivity, and they will rebuild the ruined cities, and inhabit them;
and they will plant vineyards, and drink wine from them. They shall also
make gardens, and eat their fruit. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> I
will plant them on their land, and they will no more be plucked up out
of their land which I have given them,” says the <span
