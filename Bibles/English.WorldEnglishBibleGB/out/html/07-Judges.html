and armed acts of the Jews in relation to the Simeonites</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> After the death of Joshua, the
children of Israel asked of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>,<a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> saying, “Who should go up for us
first against the Canaanites, to fight against them?” <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>
said, “Judah shall go up. Behold,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> I have delivered the
land into his hand.” <span class="bibleverse">3</span> Judah said to
Simeon his brother, “Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight
against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with you into your lot.”
So Simeon went with him. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> Judah went
up, and the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> delivered the Canaanites
and the Perizzites into their hand. They struck ten thousand men in
Bezek. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> They found Adoni-Bezek in
Bezek, and they fought against him. They struck the Canaanites and the
Perizzites. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> But Adoni-Bezek fled. They
pursued him, caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his big toes. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> Adoni-Bezek said, “Seventy kings, having
their thumbs and their big toes cut off, scavenged under my table. As I
have done, so God<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> has done to me.” They brought him to
Jerusalem, and he died there. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> The
children of Judah fought against Jerusalem, took it, struck it with the
edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.</p>
<h2 id="conquest-of-hebron-and-debir-by-kaleb-and-othniel">Conquest of
Hebron and Debir by Kaleb and Othniel</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">9</span> After that, the children of Judah
went down to fight against the Canaanites who lived in the hill country,
and in the South, and in the lowland. <span class="bibleverse">10</span>
Judah went against the Canaanites who lived in Hebron. (The name of
Hebron before that was Kiriath Arba.) They struck Sheshai, Ahiman, and
Talmai. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> From there he went against
the inhabitants of Debir. (The name of Debir before that was Kiriath
Sepher.) <span class="bibleverse">12</span> Caleb said, “I will give
Achsah my daughter as wife to the man who strikes Kiriath Sepher, and
takes it.” <span class="bibleverse">13</span> Othniel the son of Kenaz,
Caleb’s younger brother, took it, so he gave him Achsah his daughter as
his wife. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> When she came, she got him
to ask her father for a field. She got off her donkey; and Caleb said to
her, “What would you like?” <span class="bibleverse">15</span> She said
to him, “Give me a blessing; because you have set me in the land of the
South, give me also springs of water.” Then Caleb gave her the upper
springs and the lower springs.</p>
<h2 id="connection-of-the-kenites-with-judah">Connection of the Kenites
with Judah</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">16</span> The children of the Kenite, Moses’
brother-in-law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the children
of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which is in the south of Arad;
and they went and lived with the people.</p>
<h2 id="more-war-enterprises-of-the-jews">More war enterprises of the
Jews</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">17</span> Judah went with Simeon his
brother, and they struck the Canaanites who inhabited Zephath, and
utterly destroyed it. The name of the city was called Hormah. <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> Also Judah took Gaza with its border, and
Ashkelon with its border, and Ekron with its border. <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> was
with Judah, and drove out the inhabitants of the hill country; for he
could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had
chariots of iron. <span class="bibleverse">20</span> They gave Hebron to
Caleb, as Moses had said, and he drove the three sons of Anak out of
there. <span class="bibleverse">21</span> The children of Benjamin
didn’t drive out the Jebusites who inhabited Jerusalem, but the
Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this
day.</p>
<h2
id="companies-of-the-josephites-and-other-tribes-the-canaanites-will-not-be-completely-expelled">Companies
of the Josephites and other tribes; the Canaanites will not be
completely expelled</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">22</span> The house of Joseph also went up
against Bethel, and the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> was with
them. <span class="bibleverse">23</span> The house of Joseph sent to spy
out Bethel. (The name of the city before that was Luz.) <span
class="bibleverse">24</span> The watchers saw a man come out of the
city, and they said to him, “Please show us the entrance into the city,
and we will deal kindly with you.” <span class="bibleverse">25</span> He
showed them the entrance into the city, and they struck the city with
the edge of the sword; but they let the man and all his family go. <span
class="bibleverse">26</span> The man went into the land of the Hittites,
built a city, and called its name Luz, which is its name to this
day.</p>
<h2 id="overview-of-the-unconquered-territories">Overview of the
unconquered territories</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">27</span> Manasseh didn’t drive out the
inhabitants of Beth Shean and its towns, nor Taanach and its towns, nor
the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and
its towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns; but the
Canaanites would dwell in that land. <span class="bibleverse">28</span>
When Israel had grown strong, they put the Canaanites to forced labour,
and didn’t utterly drive them out. <span class="bibleverse">29</span>
Ephraim didn’t drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer, but the
Canaanites lived in Gezer amongst them. <span
class="bibleverse">30</span> Zebulun didn’t drive out the inhabitants of
Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites lived amongst
them, and became subject to forced labour. <span
class="bibleverse">31</span> Asher didn’t drive out the inhabitants of
Acco, nor the inhabitants of Sidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of
Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob; <span class="bibleverse">32</span>
but the Asherites lived amongst the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the
land, for they didn’t drive them out. <span class="bibleverse">33</span>
Naphtali didn’t drive out the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh, nor the
inhabitants of Beth Anath; but he lived amongst the Canaanites, the
inhabitants of the land. Nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh
and of Beth Anath became subject to forced labour. <span
class="bibleverse">34</span> The Amorites forced the children of Dan
into the hill country, for they would not allow them to come down to the
valley; <span class="bibleverse">35</span> but the Amorites would dwell
in Mount Heres, in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim. Yet the hand of the house
of Joseph prevailed, so that they became subject to forced labour. <span
class="bibleverse">36</span> The border of the Amorites was from the
ascent of Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward.</p>

<h2
id="the-angel-of-the-lords-threat-of-punishment-against-israel-for-violating-covenant-duty">The
angel of the Lord's threat of punishment against Israel for violating
covenant duty</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s angel came up from Gilgal to Bochim. He
said, “I brought you out of Egypt, and have brought you to the land
which I swore to give your fathers. I said, ‘I will never break my
covenant with you. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> You shall make no
covenant with the inhabitants of this land. You shall break down their
altars.’ But you have not listened to my voice. Why have you done this?
<span class="bibleverse">3</span> Therefore I also said, ‘I will not
drive them out from before you; but they shall be in your sides, and
their gods will be a snare to you.’” <span class="bibleverse">4</span>
When the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s angel spoke these words
to all the children of Israel, the people lifted up their voice and
wept. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> They called the name of that
place Bochim,<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> and they sacrificed there to the
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>.</p>
<h2
id="after-the-death-of-joshua-and-his-companions-israel-turned-to-idolatry">After
the death of Joshua and his companions, Israel turned to idolatry</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">6</span> Now when Joshua had sent the people
away, the children of Israel each went to his inheritance to possess the
land. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> The people served the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> all the days of Joshua, and all the days
of the elders who outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great work of
the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> that he had worked for Israel.
<span class="bibleverse">8</span> Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of
the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, died, being one hundred and ten
years old. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> They buried him in the
border of his inheritance in Timnath Heres, in the hill country of
Ephraim, on the north of the mountain of Gaash. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> After all that generation were gathered to
their fathers, another generation arose after them who didn’t know the
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, nor the work which he had done for
Israel. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> The children of Israel did
that which was evil in the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s sight,
and served the Baals. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> They abandoned
the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the God of their fathers, who
brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the
gods of the peoples who were around them, and bowed themselves down to
them; and they provoked the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> to
anger.</p>
<h2
id="regular-alternation-of-apostasy-and-punishment-repentance-and-salvation-gods-wrath">Regular
alternation of apostasy and punishment, repentance and salvation; God's
wrath</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">13</span> They abandoned the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and served Baal and the Ashtaroth. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s
anger burnt against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of
raiders who plundered them. He sold them into the hands of their enemies
all around, so that they could no longer stand before their enemies.
<span class="bibleverse">15</span> Wherever they went out, the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s hand was against them for evil, as the
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> had spoken, and as the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> had sworn to them; and they were very
distressed. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> raised up judges, who saved them out of
the hand of those who plundered them. <span class="bibleverse">17</span>
Yet they didn’t listen to their judges; for they prostituted themselves
to other gods, and bowed themselves down to them. They quickly turned
away from the way in which their fathers walked, obeying the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s commandments. They didn’t do so. <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> When the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> raised up judges for them, then the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> was with the judge, and saved them out of
the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge; for it grieved the
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> because of their groaning by reason
of those who oppressed them and troubled them. <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> But when the judge was dead, they turned
back, and dealt more corruptly than their fathers in following other
gods to serve them and to bow down to them. They didn’t cease what they
were doing, or give up their stubborn ways. <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s
anger burnt against Israel; and he said, “Because this nation
transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and has not
listened to my voice, <span class="bibleverse">21</span> I also will no
longer drive out any of the nations that Joshua left when he died from
before them; <span class="bibleverse">22</span> that by them I may test
Israel, to see if they will keep the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s way to walk therein, as their fathers
kept it, or not.” <span class="bibleverse">23</span> So the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> left those nations, without driving them
out hastily. He didn’t deliver them into Joshua’s hand.</p>

Israelites to test and guide</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Now these are the nations which the
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> left, to test Israel by them, even
as many as had not known all the wars of Canaan; <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> only that the generations of the children of
Israel might know, to teach them war, at least those who knew nothing of
it before: <span class="bibleverse">3</span> the five lords of the
Philistines, all the Canaanites, the Sidonians, and the Hivites who
lived on Mount Lebanon, from Mount Baal Hermon to the entrance of
Hamath. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> They were left to test Israel
by them, to know whether they would listen to the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s commandments, which he commanded their
fathers by Moses. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> The children of
Israel lived amongst the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the
Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> They took their daughters to be their wives,
and gave their own daughters to their sons and served their gods.</p>
<h2 id="the-first-judges-othniel-ehud-and-shamgar">The first judges:
Othniel, Ehud and Shamgar</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">7</span> The children of Israel did that
which was evil in the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s sight, and
forgot the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> their God, and served the
Baals and the Asheroth. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> Therefore the
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s anger burnt against Israel, and he
sold them into the hand of Cushan Rishathaim king of Mesopotamia; and
the children of Israel served Cushan Rishathaim eight years. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> When the children of Israel cried to the
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> raised up a saviour to the children of
Israel, who saved them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger
brother. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s Spirit came on him, and he judged
Israel; and he went out to war, and the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> delivered Cushan Rishathaim king of
Mesopotamia into his hand. His hand prevailed against Cushan Rishathaim.
<span class="bibleverse">11</span> The land had rest forty years, then
Othniel the son of Kenaz died. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> The
children of Israel again did that which was evil in the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s sight, and the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> strengthened Eglon the king of Moab
against Israel, because they had done that which was evil in the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s sight. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> He gathered the children of Ammon and
Amalek to himself; and he went and struck Israel, and they possessed the
city of palm trees. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> The children of
Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> But when the children of Israel cried to
the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> raised up a saviour for them: Ehud the son
of Gera, the Benjamite, a left-handed man. The children of Israel sent
tribute by him to Eglon the king of Moab. <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> Ehud made himself a sword which had two
edges, a cubit<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> in length; and he wore it under his
clothing on his right thigh. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> He
offered the tribute to Eglon king of Moab. Now Eglon was a very fat man.
<span class="bibleverse">18</span> When Ehud had finished offering the
tribute, he sent away the people who carried the tribute. <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> But he himself turned back from the stone
idols that were by Gilgal, and said, “I have a secret message for you, O
king.” The king said, “Keep silence!” All who stood by him left him.
<span class="bibleverse">20</span> Ehud came to him; and he was sitting
by himself alone in the cool upper room. Ehud said, “I have a message
from God to you.” He arose out of his seat. <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> Ehud put out his left hand, and took the
sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into his body. <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> The handle also went in after the blade;
and the fat closed on the blade, for he didn’t draw the sword out of his
body; and it came out behind. <span class="bibleverse">23</span> Then
Ehud went out onto the porch, and shut the doors of the upper room on
him, and locked them. <span class="bibleverse">24</span> After he had
gone, his servants came and saw that the doors of the upper room were
locked. They said, “Surely he is covering his feet<a href="#fn6"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> in
the upper room.” <span class="bibleverse">25</span> They waited until
they were ashamed; and behold, he didn’t open the doors of the upper
room. Therefore they took the key and opened them, and behold, their
lord had fallen down dead on the floor. <span
class="bibleverse">26</span> Ehud escaped while they waited, passed
beyond the stone idols, and escaped to Seirah. <span
class="bibleverse">27</span> When he had come, he blew a trumpet in the
hill country of Ephraim; and the children of Israel went down with him
from the hill country, and he led them. <span
class="bibleverse">28</span> He said to them, “Follow me; for the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> has delivered your enemies the Moabites
into your hand.” They followed him, and took the fords of the Jordan
against the Moabites, and didn’t allow any man to pass over. <span
class="bibleverse">29</span> They struck at that time about ten thousand
men of Moab, every strong man and every man of valour. No man escaped.
<span class="bibleverse">30</span> So Moab was subdued that day under
the hand of Israel. Then the land had rest eighty years. <span
class="bibleverse">31</span> After him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who
struck six hundred men of the Philistines with an ox goad. He also saved
Israel.</p>

<h2 id="king-jabin-and-his-general-sisera-enslaved-israel">King Jabin
and his general Sisera enslaved Israel</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> The children of Israel again did
that which was evil in the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s sight,
when Ehud was dead. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> sold them into the hand of Jabin king of
Canaan, who reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose army was Sisera, who
lived in Harosheth of the Gentiles. <span class="bibleverse">3</span>
The children of Israel cried to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>,
for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and he mightily oppressed the
children of Israel for twenty years.</p>

and Barak's connection; Barak leads the army of the northern tribes into

<p><span class="bibleverse">4</span> Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife
of Lappidoth, judged Israel at that time. <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> She lived under Deborah’s palm tree between
Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim; and the children of
Israel came up to her for judgement. <span class="bibleverse">6</span>
She sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedesh Naphtali, and
said to him, “Hasn’t the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the God of
Israel, commanded, ‘Go and lead the way to Mount Tabor, and take with
you ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of
Zebulun? <span class="bibleverse">7</span> I will draw to you, to the
river Kishon, Sisera, the captain of Jabin’s army, with his chariots and
his multitude; and I will deliver him into your hand.’” <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> Barak said to her, “If you will go with me,
then I will go; but if you will not go with me, I will not go.” <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> She said, “I will surely go with you.
Nevertheless, the journey that you take won’t be for your honour; for
the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> will sell Sisera into a woman’s
hand.” Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali together
to Kedesh. Ten thousand men followed him; and Deborah went up with him.
<span class="bibleverse">11</span> Now Heber the Kenite had separated
himself from the Kenites, even from the children of Hobab, Moses’
brother-in-law, and had pitched his tent as far as the oak in Zaanannim,
which is by Kedesh.</p>
<h2

defeat and murder of Sisera on the plain of Kison; The terrible deed of

<p><span class="bibleverse">12</span> They told Sisera that Barak the
son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> Sisera gathered together all his chariots,
even nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people who were with
him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles, to the river Kishon. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> Deborah said to Barak, “Go; for this is the
day in which the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> has delivered
Sisera into your hand. Hasn’t the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>
gone out before you?” So Barak went down from Mount Tabor, and ten
thousand men after him. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> confused Sisera, all his chariots, and all
his army, with the edge of the sword before Barak. Sisera abandoned his
chariot and fled away on his feet. <span class="bibleverse">16</span>
But Barak pursued the chariots and the army to Harosheth of the
Gentiles; and all the army of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword.
There was not a man left. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> However
Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the
Kenite; for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the
house of Heber the Kenite. <span class="bibleverse">18</span> Jael went
out to meet Sisera, and said to him, “Turn in, my lord, turn in to me;
don’t be afraid.” He came in to her into the tent, and she covered him
with a rug. <span class="bibleverse">19</span> He said to her, “Please
give me a little water to drink; for I am thirsty.” She opened a
container of milk, and gave him a drink, and covered him. <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> He said to her, “Stand in the door of the
tent, and if any man comes and enquires of you, and says, ‘Is there any
man here?’ you shall say, ‘No.’” <span class="bibleverse">21</span> Then
Jael, Heber’s wife, took a tent peg, and took a hammer in her hand, and
went softly to him, and struck the pin into his temples, and it pierced
through into the ground, for he was in a deep sleep; so he fainted and
died. <span class="bibleverse">22</span> Behold, as Barak pursued
Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said to him, “Come, and I will
show you the man whom you seek.” He came to her; and behold, Sisera lay
dead, and the tent peg was in his temples. <span
class="bibleverse">23</span> So God subdued Jabin the king of Canaan
before the children of Israel on that day. <span
class="bibleverse">24</span> The hand of the children of Israel
prevailed more and more against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had
destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.</p>

hear the whistling for the flocks? At the watercourses of Reuben, there

Gilead lived beyond the Jordan. Why did Dan remain in ships? Asher sat

She struck through his head. Yes, she pierced and struck through his

beating out wheat in the wine press, to hide it from the Midianites.
<span class="bibleverse">12</span> The <span

<span class="bibleverse">15</span> He said to him, “O Lord,<a

family is the poorest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father’s

and you shall strike the Midianites as one man.” <span

in your sight, then show me a sign that it is you who talk with me.
<span class="bibleverse">18</span> Please don’t go away until I come to
you, and bring out my present, and lay it before you.” He said, “I will
wait until you come back.” <span class="bibleverse">19</span> Gideon
went in and prepared a young goat and unleavened cakes of an ephah<a

even the second bull seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal
that your father has, and cut down the Asherah that is by it. <span
class="bibleverse">26</span> Then build an altar to the <span

an orderly way, and take the second bull, and offer a burnt offering
with the wood of the Asherah which you shall cut down.” <span
class="bibleverse">27</span> Then Gideon took ten men of his servants,
and did as the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> had spoken to him.
Because he feared his father’s household and the men of the city, he
could not do it by day, but he did it by night. <span
class="bibleverse">28</span> When the men of the city arose early in the
morning, behold, the altar of Baal was broken down, and the Asherah was
cut down that was by it, and the second bull was offered on the altar
that was built. <span class="bibleverse">29</span> They said to one
another, “Who has done this thing?” When they enquired and asked, they
said, “Gideon the son of Joash has done this thing.” <span
class="bibleverse">30</span> Then the men of the city said to Joash,
“Bring out your son, that he may die, because he has broken down the
altar of Baal, and because he has cut down the Asherah that was by it.”
<span class="bibleverse">31</span> Joash said to all who stood against
him, “Will you contend for Baal? Or will you save him? He who will
contend for him, let him be put to death by morning! If he is a god, let
him contend for himself, because someone has broken down his altar!”
<span class="bibleverse">32</span> Therefore on that day he named him
Jerub-Baal,<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"

him, because he has broken down his altar.” <span

and the children of the east assembled themselves together; and they
passed over, and encamped in the valley of Jezreel. <span
class="bibleverse">34</span> But the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s Spirit came on Gideon, and he blew a
trumpet; and Abiezer was gathered together to follow him. <span
class="bibleverse">35</span> He sent messengers throughout all Manasseh,
and they also were gathered together to follow him. He sent messengers
to Asher, to Zebulun, and to Naphtali; and they came up to meet them.
<span class="bibleverse">36</span> Gideon said to God, “If you will save
Israel by my hand, as you have spoken, <span
class="bibleverse">37</span> behold, I will put a fleece of wool on the
threshing floor. If there is dew on the fleece only, and it is dry on
all the ground, then I’ll know that you will save Israel by my hand, as
you have spoken.” <span class="bibleverse">38</span> It was so; for he
rose up early on the next day, and pressed the fleece together, and
wrung the dew out of the fleece, a bowl full of water. <span
class="bibleverse">39</span> Gideon said to God, “Don’t let your anger
be kindled against me, and I will speak but this once. Please let me
make a trial just this once with the fleece. Let it now be dry only on
the fleece, and on all the ground let there be dew.” <span
class="bibleverse">40</span> God did so that night; for it was dry on
the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground.</p>

<h2 id="gideons-victory-over-the-midianites">Gideon's victory over the

<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and

<p><span class="bibleverse">2</span> The <span

you are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hand, lest
Israel brag against me, saying, ‘My own hand has saved me.’ <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> Now therefore proclaim in the ears of the
people, saying, ‘Whoever is fearful and trembling, let him return and
depart from Mount Gilead.’” So twenty-two thousand of the people
returned, and ten thousand remained. <span class="bibleverse">4</span>
The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> said to Gideon, “There are still
too many people. Bring them down to the water, and I will test them for
you there. It shall be, that those whom I tell you, ‘This shall go with
you,’ shall go with you; and whoever I tell you, ‘This shall not go with
you,’ shall not go.” <span class="bibleverse">5</span> So he brought
down the people to the water; and the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> said to Gideon, “Everyone who laps of the
water with his tongue, like a dog laps, you shall set him by himself;
likewise everyone who bows down on his knees to drink.” <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> The number of those who lapped, putting
their hand to their mouth, was three hundred men; but all the rest of
the people bowed down on their knees to drink water. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> said
to Gideon, “I will save you by the three hundred men who lapped, and
deliver the Midianites into your hand. Let all the other people go, each
to his own place.” <span class="bibleverse">8</span> So the people took
food in their hand, and their trumpets; and he sent all the rest of the
men of Israel to their own tents, but retained the three hundred men;
and the camp of Midian was beneath him in the valley.</p>
<h2

confidence is strengthened by infiltrating the enemy camp</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">9</span> That same night, the <span

Purah your servant down to the camp. <span class="bibleverse">11</span>
You will hear what they say; and afterward your hands will be
strengthened to go down into the camp.” Then went he down with Purah his
servant to the outermost part of the armed men who were in the camp.
<span class="bibleverse">12</span> The Midianites and the Amalekites and
all the children of the east lay along in the valley like locusts for
multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand which is on
the seashore for multitude. <span class="bibleverse">13</span> When
Gideon had come, behold, there was a man telling a dream to his fellow.
He said, “Behold, I dreamt a dream; and behold, a cake of barley bread
tumbled into the camp of Midian, came to the tent, and struck it so that
it fell, and turned it upside down, so that the tent lay flat.” <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> His fellow answered, “This is nothing other
than the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel. God has
delivered Midian into his hand, with all the army.” <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> It was so, when Gideon heard the telling of
the dream and its interpretation, that he worshipped. Then he returned
into the camp of Israel and said, “Arise, for the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> has delivered the army of Midian into your
hand!”</p>
<h2 id="gideons-victorious-raid-on-the-midianite-camp">Gideon's

<p><span class="bibleverse">16</span> He divided the three hundred men
into three companies, and he put into the hands of all them trumpets and
empty pitchers, with torches within the pitchers. <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> He said to them, “Watch me, and do
likewise. Behold, when I come to the outermost part of the camp, it
shall be that, as I do, so you shall do. <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> When I blow the trumpet, I and all who are
with me, then blow the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and
shout, ‘For the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> and for Gideon!’”
<span class="bibleverse">19</span> So Gideon and the hundred men who
were with him came to the outermost part of the camp in the beginning of
the middle watch, when they had but newly set the watch. Then they blew
the trumpets and broke in pieces the pitchers that were in their hands.
<span class="bibleverse">20</span> The three companies blew the
trumpets, broke the pitchers, and held the torches in their left hands
and the trumpets in their right hands with which to blow; and they
shouted, “The sword of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> and of
Gideon!” <span class="bibleverse">21</span> They each stood in his place
around the camp, and all the army ran; and they shouted, and put them to
flight. <span class="bibleverse">22</span> They blew the three hundred
trumpets, and the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> set every man’s
sword against his fellow and against all the army; and the army fled as
far as Beth Shittah towards Zererah, as far as the border of Abel
Meholah, by Tabbath.</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">23</span> The men of Israel were gathered

pursued Midian. <span class="bibleverse">24</span> Gideon sent
messengers throughout all the hill country of Ephraim, saying, “Come
down against Midian and take the waters before them as far as Beth
Barah, even the Jordan!” So all the men of Ephraim were gathered
together and took the waters as far as Beth Barah, even the Jordan.
<span class="bibleverse">25</span> They took the two princes of Midian,
Oreb and Zeeb. They killed Oreb at Oreb’s rock, and Zeeb they killed at
Zeeb’s wine press, as they pursued Midian. Then they brought the heads
of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon beyond the Jordan.</p>
<h1 id="section-7">8</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> The men of Ephraim said to him,
“Why have you treated us this way, that you didn’t call us when you went
to fight with Midian?” They rebuked him sharply. <span

comparison with you? Isn’t the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better
than the vintage of Abiezer? <span class="bibleverse">3</span> God has
delivered into your hand the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb! What was

Succoth, “Please give loaves of bread to the people who follow me; for
they are faint, and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of
Midian.” <span class="bibleverse">6</span> The princes of Succoth said,
“Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand, that we should
give bread to your army?” <span class="bibleverse">7</span> Gideon said,
“Therefore when the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> has delivered
Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, then I will tear your flesh with the
thorns of the wilderness and with briers.” <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> He went up there to Penuel, and spoke to
them in the same way; and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of

the men of Penuel, saying, “When I come again in peace, I will break

lived in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and struck the army;
for the army felt secure. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> Zebah and

battle from the ascent of Heres. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> He
caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and enquired of him; and he
described for him the princes of Succoth, and its elders, seventy-seven

saying, ‘Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand, that we

that you would each give me the earrings of his plunder.” (For they had
golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.) <span

them.” They spread a garment, and every man threw the earrings of his
plunder into it. <span class="bibleverse">26</span> The weight of the
golden earrings that he requested was one thousand and seven hundred

crescents, and the pendants, and the purple clothing that was on the
kings of Midian, and in addition to the chains that were about their
camels’ necks. <span class="bibleverse">27</span> Gideon made an ephod
out of it, and put it in Ophrah, his city. Then all Israel played the
prostitute with it there; and it became a snare to Gideon and to his
house. <span class="bibleverse">28</span> So Midian was subdued before
the children of Israel, and they lifted up their heads no more. The land
had rest forty years in the days of Gideon. <span

in his own house. <span class="bibleverse">30</span> Gideon had seventy

<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went
to Shechem to his mother’s brothers, and spoke with them and with all
the family of the house of his mother’s father, saying, <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> “Please speak in the ears of all the men of
Shechem, ‘Is it better for you that all the sons of Jerubbaal, who are
seventy persons, rule over you, or that one rule over you?’ Remember
also that I am your bone and your flesh.” <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> His mother’s brothers spoke of him in the
ears of all the men of Shechem all these words. Their hearts inclined to
follow Abimelech; for they said, “He is our brother.” <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> They gave him seventy pieces of silver out
of the house of Baal Berith, with which Abimelech hired vain and
reckless fellows who followed him. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> He
went to his father’s house at Ophrah, and killed his brothers the sons
of Jerubbaal, being seventy persons, on one stone; but Jotham the
youngest son of Jerubbaal was left, for he hid himself. <span

together with all the house of Millo, and went and made Abimelech king

<p><span class="bibleverse">7</span> When they told it to Jotham, he
went and stood on the top of Mount Gerizim and lifted up his voice,
cried out, and said to them, “Listen to me, you men of Shechem, that God
may listen to you. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> The trees set out
to anoint a king over themselves. They said to the olive tree, ‘Reign

them, ‘Should I stop producing my oil, with which they honour God and
man by me, and go to wave back and forth over the trees?’ <span

<h2 id="disastrous-development-of-the-situation-in-shechem">Disastrous
development of the situation in Shechem</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">22</span> Abimelech was prince over Israel
three years. <span class="bibleverse">23</span> Then God sent an evil
spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem
dealt treacherously with Abimelech, <span class="bibleverse">24</span>
that the violence done to the seventy sons of Jerubbaal might come, and
that their blood might be laid on Abimelech their brother who killed
them, and on the men of Shechem who strengthened his hands to kill his
brothers. <span class="bibleverse">25</span> The men of Shechem set an
ambush for him on the tops of the mountains, and they robbed all who
came along that way by them; and Abimelech was told about it. <span
class="bibleverse">26</span> Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brothers
and went over to Shechem; and the men of Shechem put their trust in him.
<span class="bibleverse">27</span> They went out into the field,
harvested their vineyards, trod the grapes, celebrated, and went into
the house of their god and ate and drank, and cursed Abimelech. <span
class="bibleverse">28</span> Gaal the son of Ebed said, “Who is
Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? Isn’t he the
son of Jerubbaal? Isn’t Zebul his officer? Serve the men of Hamor the
father of Shechem, but why should we serve him? <span
class="bibleverse">29</span> I wish that this people were under my hand!
Then I would remove Abimelech.” He said to Abimelech, “Increase your
army and come out!” <span class="bibleverse">30</span> When Zebul the
ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger
burnt. <span class="bibleverse">31</span> He sent messengers to
Abimelech craftily, saying, “Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his
brothers have come to Shechem; and behold, they incite the city against
you. <span class="bibleverse">32</span> Now therefore, go up by night,
you and the people who are with you, and lie in wait in the field. <span
class="bibleverse">33</span> It shall be that in the morning, as soon as
the sun is up, you shall rise early and rush on the city. Behold, when
he and the people who are with him come out against you, then may you do
to them as you shall find occasion.” <span class="bibleverse">34</span>
Abimelech rose up, and all the people who were with him, by night, and
they laid wait against Shechem in four companies. <span
class="bibleverse">35</span> Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in
the entrance of the gate of the city. Abimelech rose up, and the people
who were with him, from the ambush. <span class="bibleverse">36</span>
When Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, “Behold, people are coming
down from the tops of the mountains.” Zebul said to him, “You see the
shadows of the mountains as if they were men.” <span
class="bibleverse">37</span> Gaal spoke again and said, “Behold, people
are coming down by the middle of the land, and one company comes by the
way of the oak of Meonenim.” <span class="bibleverse">38</span> Then
Zebul said to him, “Now where is your mouth, that you said, ‘Who is
Abimelech, that we should serve him?’ Isn’t this the people that you
have despised? Please go out now and fight with them.” <span
class="bibleverse">39</span> Gaal went out before the men of Shechem,
and fought with Abimelech. <span class="bibleverse">40</span> Abimelech
chased him, and he fled before him, and many fell wounded, even to the
entrance of the gate. <span class="bibleverse">41</span> Abimelech lived
at Arumah; and Zebul drove out Gaal and his brothers, that they should
not dwell in Shechem.</p>

bloody victory of Abimelech, destruction of the city of Shechem;
Abimelech's indignation against the inhabitants of the castle and his

<p><span class="bibleverse">42</span> On the next day, the people went
out into the field; and they told Abimelech. <span
class="bibleverse">43</span> He took the people and divided them into
three companies, and laid wait in the field; and he looked, and behold,
the people came out of the city. So, he rose up against them and struck
them. <span class="bibleverse">44</span> Abimelech and the companies
that were with him rushed forward and stood in the entrance of the gate
of the city; and the two companies rushed on all who were in the field
and struck them. <span class="bibleverse">45</span> Abimelech fought
against the city all that day; and he took the city and killed the
people in it. He beat down the city and sowed it with salt. <span
class="bibleverse">46</span> When all the men of the tower of Shechem
heard of it, they entered into the stronghold of the house of Elberith.
<span class="bibleverse">47</span> Abimelech was told that all the men
of the tower of Shechem were gathered together. <span
class="bibleverse">48</span> Abimelech went up to Mount Zalmon, he and
all the people who were with him; and Abimelech took an axe in his hand,
and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it up, and laid it on his
shoulder. Then he said to the people who were with him, “What you have
seen me do, make haste, and do as I have done!” <span
class="bibleverse">49</span> All the people likewise each cut down his
bough, followed Abimelech, and put them at the base of the stronghold,
and set the stronghold on fire over them, so that all the people of the
tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women. <span
class="bibleverse">50</span> Then Abimelech went to Thebez and encamped
against Thebez, and took it. <span class="bibleverse">51</span> But
there was a strong tower within the city, and all the men and women of
the city fled there, and shut themselves in, and went up to the roof of
the tower. <span class="bibleverse">52</span> Abimelech came to the
tower and fought against it, and came near to the door of the tower to
burn it with fire. <span class="bibleverse">53</span> A certain woman
cast an upper millstone on Abimelech’s head, and broke his skull. <span
class="bibleverse">54</span> Then he called hastily to the young man,
his armour bearer, and said to him, “Draw your sword and kill me, that
men not say of me, ‘A woman killed him.’ His young man thrust him
through, and he died.” <span class="bibleverse">55</span> When the men
of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they each departed to his place.
<span class="bibleverse">56</span> Thus God repaid the wickedness of
Abimelech, which he did to his father in killing his seventy brothers;
<span class="bibleverse">57</span> and God repaid all the wickedness of
the men of Shechem on their heads; and the curse of Jotham the son of
Jerubbaal came on them.</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> After Abimelech, Tola the son of

died, and was buried in Shamir. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> After
him Jair, the Gileadite, arose. He judged Israel twenty-two years. <span

<p><span class="bibleverse">6</span> The children of Israel again did
that which was evil in the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s sight,
and served the Baals, the Ashtaroth, the gods of Syria, the gods of
Sidon, the gods of Moab, the gods of the children of Ammon, and the gods
of the Philistines. They abandoned the <span

Israel that year. For eighteen years they oppressed all the children of
Israel that were beyond the Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which is
in Gilead. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> The children of Ammon
passed over the Jordan to fight also against Judah, and against
Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim, so that Israel was very
distressed. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> The children of Israel
cried to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, saying, “We have
sinned against you, even because we have forsaken our God, and have
served the Baals.” <span class="bibleverse">11</span> The <span

Sidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites, oppressed you; and
you cried to me, and I saved you out of their hand. <span

gods. Therefore I will save you no more. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> Go and cry to the gods which you have
chosen. Let them save you in the time of your distress!” <span

good to you; only deliver us, please, today.” <span

<p><span class="bibleverse">17</span> Then the children of Ammon were

one another, “Who is the man who will begin to fight against the
children of Ammon? He shall be head over all the inhabitants of
Gilead.”</p>
<h1 id="section-10">11</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a
mighty man of valour. He was the son of a prostitute. Gilead became the
father of Jephthah. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> Gilead’s wife bore
him sons. When his wife’s sons grew up, they drove Jephthah out and said
to him, “You will not inherit in our father’s house, for you are the son
of another woman.” <span class="bibleverse">3</span> Then Jephthah fled
from his brothers and lived in the land of Tob. Outlaws joined up with
Jephthah, and they went out with him. <span class="bibleverse">4</span>
After a while, the children of Ammon made war against Israel. <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> When the children of Ammon made war against
Israel, the elders of Gilead went to get Jephthah out of the land of
Tob. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> They said to Jephthah, “Come and
be our chief, that we may fight with the children of Ammon.” <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead,
“Didn’t you hate me, and drive me out of my father’s house? Why have you
come to me now when you are in distress?” <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> The elders of Gilead said to Jephthah,
“Therefore we have turned again to you now, that you may go with us and
fight with the children of Ammon. You will be our head over all the
inhabitants of Gilead.” <span class="bibleverse">9</span> Jephthah said
to the elders of Gilead, “If you bring me home again to fight with the
children of Ammon, and the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> delivers
them before me, will I be your head?” <span class="bibleverse">10</span>
The elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, “The <span

do what you say.” <span class="bibleverse">11</span> Then Jephthah went
with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and chief over

<h2 id="jephthahs-failed-negotiations-with-the-ammonites">Jephthah's

<p><span class="bibleverse">12</span> Jephthah sent messengers to the
king of the children of Ammon, saying, “What do you have to do with me,
that you have come to me to fight against my land?” <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> The king of the children of Ammon answered
the messengers of Jephthah, “Because Israel took away my land when he
came up out of Egypt, from the Arnon even to the Jabbok, and to the
Jordan. Now therefore restore that territory again peaceably.” <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> Jephthah sent messengers again to the king
of the children of Ammon; <span class="bibleverse">15</span> and he said
to him, “Jephthah says: Israel didn’t take away the land of Moab, nor
the land of the children of Ammon; <span class="bibleverse">16</span>
but when they came up from Egypt, and Israel went through the wilderness
to the Red Sea, and came to Kadesh, <span class="bibleverse">17</span>
then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, ‘Please let me
pass through your land;’ but the king of Edom didn’t listen. In the same
way, he sent to the king of Moab, but he refused; so Israel stayed in
Kadesh. <span class="bibleverse">18</span> Then they went through the
wilderness, and went around the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and
came by the east side of the land of Moab, and they encamped on the
other side of the Arnon; but they didn’t come within the border of Moab,
for the Arnon was the border of Moab. <span class="bibleverse">19</span>
Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of
Heshbon; and Israel said to him, ‘Please let us pass through your land
to my place.’ <span class="bibleverse">20</span> But Sihon didn’t trust
Israel to pass through his border; but Sihon gathered all his people
together, and encamped in Jahaz, and fought against Israel. <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>,
the God of Israel, delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of
Israel, and they struck them. So Israel possessed all the land of the
Amorites, the inhabitants of that country. <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> They possessed all the border of the
Amorites, from the Arnon even to the Jabbok, and from the wilderness
even to the Jordan. <span class="bibleverse">23</span> So now the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, has dispossessed the
Amorites from before his people Israel, and should you possess them?
<span class="bibleverse">24</span> Won’t you possess that which Chemosh
your god gives you to possess? So whoever the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> our God has dispossessed from before us,
them will we possess. <span class="bibleverse">25</span> Now are you
anything better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he ever
strive against Israel, or did he ever fight against them? <span
class="bibleverse">26</span> Israel lived in Heshbon and its towns, and
in Aroer and its towns, and in all the cities that are along the side of
the Arnon for three hundred years! Why didn’t you recover them within
that time? <span class="bibleverse">27</span> Therefore I have not
sinned against you, but you do me wrong to war against me. May The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> the Judge be judge today between the
children of Israel and the children of Ammon.” <span
class="bibleverse">28</span> However, the king of the children of Ammon

<p><span class="bibleverse">29</span> Then the <span

over Gilead and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpah of Gilead, and from
Mizpah of Gilead he passed over to the children of Ammon. <span
class="bibleverse">30</span> Jephthah vowed a vow to the <span

children of Ammon into my hand, <span class="bibleverse">31</span> then
it shall be, that whatever comes out of the doors of my house to meet me
when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, it shall be the <span

the children of Ammon to fight against them; and the <span

and with dances. She was his only child. Besides her he had neither son
nor daughter. <span class="bibleverse">35</span> When he saw her, he
tore his clothes, and said, “Alas, my daughter! You have brought me very
low, and you are one of those who trouble me; for I have opened my mouth
to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and I can’t go back.” <span
class="bibleverse">36</span> She said to him, “My father, you have
opened your mouth to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>; do to me
according to that which has proceeded out of your mouth, because the
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> has taken vengeance for you on your
enemies, even on the children of Ammon.” <span
class="bibleverse">37</span> Then she said to her father, “Let this
thing be done for me. Leave me alone two months, that I may depart and
go down on the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my companions.”
<span class="bibleverse">38</span> He said, “Go.” He sent her away for
two months; and she departed, she and her companions, and mourned her
virginity on the mountains. <span class="bibleverse">39</span> At the
end of two months, she returned to her father, who did with her
according to his vow which he had vowed. She was a virgin. It became a
custom in Israel <span class="bibleverse">40</span> that the daughters

you come up to me today, to fight against me?” <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> Then Jephthah gathered together all the men
of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim. The men of Gilead struck Ephraim,
because they said, “You are fugitives of Ephraim, you Gileadites, in the
middle of Ephraim, and in the middle of Manasseh.” <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> The Gileadites took the fords of the Jordan
against the Ephraimites. Whenever a fugitive of Ephraim said, “Let me go
over,” the men of Gilead said to him, “Are you an Ephraimite?” If he
said, “No;” <span class="bibleverse">6</span> then they said to him,
“Now say ‘Shibboleth;’” and he said “Sibboleth”; for he couldn’t manage
to pronounce it correctly, then they seized him and killed him at the
fords of the Jordan. At that time, forty-two thousand of Ephraim fell.

and childless; but you shall conceive and bear a son. <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> Now therefore please beware and drink no
wine nor strong drink, and don’t eat any unclean thing; <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> for, behold, you shall conceive and give
birth to a son. No razor shall come on his head, for the child shall be
a Nazirite to God from the womb. He shall begin to save Israel out of
the hand of the Philistines.” <span class="bibleverse">6</span> Then the
woman came and told her husband, saying, “A man of God came to me, and
his face was like the face of the angel of God, very awesome. I didn’t
ask him where he was from, neither did he tell me his name; <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> but he said to me, ‘Behold, you shall
conceive and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink. Don’t
eat any unclean thing, for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the
womb to the day of his death.’” <span class="bibleverse">8</span> Then
Manoah entreated the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and said, “Oh,
Lord, please let the man of God whom you sent come again to us, and
teach us what we should do to the child who shall be born.” <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> God listened to the voice of Manoah, and the
angel of God came again to the woman as she sat in the field; but
Manoah, her husband, wasn’t with her. <span class="bibleverse">10</span>
The woman hurried and ran, and told her husband, saying to him, “Behold,
the man who came to me that day has appeared to me.” <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> Manoah arose and followed his wife, and
came to the man, and said to him, “Are you the man who spoke to my
wife?” He said, “I am.” <span class="bibleverse">12</span> Manoah said,
“Now let your words happen. What shall the child’s way of life and
mission be?” <span class="bibleverse">13</span> The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s angel said to Manoah, “Of all that I
said to the woman let her beware. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> She
may not eat of anything that comes of the vine, neither let her drink
wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing. Let her observe all
that I commanded her.” <span class="bibleverse">15</span> Manoah said to
the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s angel, “Please stay with us,
that we may make a young goat ready for you.” <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s
angel said to Manoah, “Though you detain me, I won’t eat your bread. If
you will prepare a burnt offering, you must offer it to the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>.” For Manoah didn’t know that he was the
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s angel. <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> Manoah said to the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s angel, “What is your name, that when
your words happen, we may honour you?” <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s
angel said to him, “Why do you ask about my name, since it is
incomprehensible<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> ?” <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> So Manoah took the young goat with the meal
offering, and offered it on the rock to the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. Then the angel did an amazing thing as
Manoah and his wife watched. <span class="bibleverse">20</span> For when
the flame went up towards the sky from off the altar, the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s angel ascended in the flame of the
altar. Manoah and his wife watched; and they fell on their faces to the
ground. <span class="bibleverse">21</span> But the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s angel didn’t appear to Manoah or to his
wife any more. Then Manoah knew that he was the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s angel. <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> Manoah said to his wife, “We shall surely
die, because we have seen God.” <span class="bibleverse">23</span> But
his wife said to him, “If the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> were
pleased to kill us, he wouldn’t have received a burnt offering and a
meal offering at our hand, and he wouldn’t have shown us all these
things, nor would he have told us such things as these at this time.”
<span class="bibleverse">24</span> The woman bore a son and named him
Samson. The child grew, and the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>

<p><span class="bibleverse">25</span> The <span

between Zorah and Eshtaol.</p>
<h1 id="section-13">14</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Samson went down to Timnah, and saw
a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> He came up, and told his father and his
mother, saying, “I have seen a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the
Philistines. Now therefore get her for me as my wife.” <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> Then his father and his mother said to him,
“Isn’t there a woman amongst your brothers’ daughters, or amongst all my
people, that you go to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines?”
Samson said to his father, “Get her for me, for she pleases me well.”
<span class="bibleverse">4</span> But his father and his mother didn’t
know that it was of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>; for he
sought an occasion against the Philistines. Now at that time the
Philistines ruled over Israel. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> Then
Samson went down to Timnah with his father and his mother, and came to
the vineyards of Timnah; and behold, a young lion roared at him. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s
Spirit came mightily on him, and he tore him as he would have torn a
young goat with his bare hands, but he didn’t tell his father or his
mother what he had done. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> He went down
and talked with the woman, and she pleased Samson well. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> After a while he returned to take her, and
he went over to see the carcass of the lion; and behold, there was a
swarm of bees in the body of the lion, and honey. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> He took it into his hands, and went on,
eating as he went. He came to his father and mother and gave to them,
and they ate, but he didn’t tell them that he had taken the honey out of
the lion’s body. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> His father went down
to the woman; and Samson made a feast there, for the young men used to
do so. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> When they saw him, they
brought thirty companions to be with him. <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> Samson said to them, “Let me tell you a
riddle now. If you can tell me the answer within the seven days of the
feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty linen garments and
thirty changes of clothing; <span class="bibleverse">13</span> but if
you can’t tell me the answer, then you shall give me thirty linen
garments and thirty changes of clothing.” They said to him, “Tell us
your riddle, that we may hear it.” <span class="bibleverse">14</span> He
said to them, “Out of the eater came out food. Out of the strong came
out sweetness.” They couldn’t in three days declare the riddle. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> On the seventh day, they said to Samson’s
wife, “Entice your husband, that he may declare to us the riddle, lest
we burn you and your father’s house with fire. Have you called us to
impoverish us? Isn’t that so?” <span class="bibleverse">16</span>
Samson’s wife wept before him, and said, “You just hate me, and don’t
love me. You’ve told a riddle to the children of my people, and haven’t
told it to me.” He said to her, “Behold, I haven’t told my father or my
mother, so why should I tell you?” <span class="bibleverse">17</span>
She wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted; and on the
seventh day, he told her, because she pressed him severely; and she told
the riddle to the children of her people. <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> The men of the city said to him on the
seventh day before the sun went down, “What is sweeter than honey? What
is stronger than a lion?” He said to them, “If you hadn’t ploughed with
my heifer, you wouldn’t have found out my riddle.” <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s
Spirit came mightily on him, and he went down to Ashkelon and struck
thirty men of them. He took their plunder, then gave the changes of
clothing to those who declared the riddle. His anger burnt, and he went
up to his father’s house. <span class="bibleverse">20</span> But
Samson’s wife was given to his companion, who had been his friend.</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> But after a while, in the time of
wheat harvest, Samson visited his wife with a young goat. He said, “I
will go in to my wife’s room.” But her father wouldn’t allow him to go
in. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> Her father said, “I most certainly
thought that you utterly hated her; therefore I gave her to your
companion. Isn’t her younger sister more beautiful than she? Please,
take her instead.” <span class="bibleverse">3</span> Samson said to
them, “This time I will be blameless in the case of the Philistines when
I harm them.” <span class="bibleverse">4</span> Samson went and caught
three hundred foxes, and took torches, and turned tail to tail, and put
a torch in the middle between every two tails. <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> When he had set the torches on fire, he let
them go into the standing grain of the Philistines, and burnt up both
the shocks and the standing grain, and also the olive groves. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> Then the Philistines said, “Who has done
this?” They said, “Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he has
taken his wife and given her to his companion.” The Philistines came up,
and burnt her and her father with fire. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> Samson said to them, “If you behave like
this, surely I will take revenge on you, and after that I will cease.”
<span class="bibleverse">8</span> He struck them hip and thigh with a
great slaughter; and he went down and lived in the cave in Etam’s
rock.</p>
<h2 id="capture-and-exploitation-of-simpson-in-lehi">Capture and
exploitation of Simpson in Lehi</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">9</span> Then the Philistines went up,
encamped in Judah, and spread themselves in Lehi. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> The men of Judah said, “Why have you come
up against us?” They said, “We have come up to bind Samson, to do to him
as he has done to us.” <span class="bibleverse">11</span> Then three
thousand men of Judah went down to the cave in Etam’s rock, and said to
Samson, “Don’t you know that the Philistines are rulers over us? What
then is this that you have done to us?” He said to them, “As they did to
me, so I have done to them.” <span class="bibleverse">12</span> They
said to him, “We have come down to bind you, that we may deliver you
into the hand of the Philistines.” Samson said to them, “Swear to me
that you will not attack me yourselves.” <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> They spoke to him, saying, “No, but we will
bind you securely and deliver you into their hands; but surely we will
not kill you.” They bound him with two new ropes, and brought him up
from the rock. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> When he came to Lehi,
the Philistines shouted as they met him. Then the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s Spirit came mightily on him, and the
ropes that were on his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire; and
his bands dropped from off his hands. <span class="bibleverse">15</span>
He found a fresh jawbone of a donkey, put out his hand, took it, and
struck a thousand men with it. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> Samson
said, “With the jawbone of a donkey, heaps on heaps; with the jawbone of
a donkey I have struck a thousand men.” <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> When he had finished speaking, he threw the
jawbone out of his hand; and that place was called Ramath Lehi.<a

role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> <span class="bibleverse">18</span>
He was very thirsty, and called on the <span

deliverance by the hand of your servant; and now shall I die of thirst,
and fall into the hands of the uncircumcised?” <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> But God split the hollow place that is in
Lehi, and water came out of it. When he had drunk, his spirit came
again, and he revived. Therefore its name was called En Hakkore, which
is in Lehi, to this day. <span class="bibleverse">20</span> He judged
Israel twenty years in the days of the Philistines.</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Samson went to Gaza, and saw there
a prostitute, and went in to her. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> The
Gazites were told, “Samson is here!” They surrounded him and laid wait
for him all night in the gate of the city, and were quiet all the night,
saying, “Wait until morning light; then we will kill him.” <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> Samson lay until midnight, then arose at
midnight and took hold of the doors of the gate of the city, with the
two posts, and plucked them up, bar and all, and put them on his

Hebron.</p>
<h2

betrayed by Delilah, blinded by the Philistines and imprisoned in
Gaza</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">4</span> It came to pass afterward that he
loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah. <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> The lords of the Philistines came up to her
and said to her, “Entice him, and see in which his great strength lies,
and by what means we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to
afflict him; and we will each give you eleven hundred pieces of silver.”
<span class="bibleverse">6</span> Delilah said to Samson, “Please tell
me where your great strength lies, and what you might be bound to
afflict you.” <span class="bibleverse">7</span> Samson said to her, “If
they bind me with seven green cords that were never dried, then shall I
become weak, and be as another man.” <span class="bibleverse">8</span>
Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green cords
which had not been dried, and she bound him with them. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> Now she had an ambush waiting in the inner
room. She said to him, “The Philistines are on you, Samson!” He broke
the cords as a flax thread is broken when it touches the fire. So his
strength was not known. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> Delilah said
to Samson, “Behold, you have mocked me, and told me lies. Now please
tell me how you might be bound.” <span class="bibleverse">11</span> He
said to her, “If they only bind me with new ropes with which no work has
been done, then shall I become weak, and be as another man.” <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> So Delilah took new ropes and bound him
with them, then said to him, “The Philistines are on you, Samson!” The
ambush was waiting in the inner room. He broke them off his arms like a
thread. <span class="bibleverse">13</span> Delilah said to Samson,
“Until now, you have mocked me and told me lies. Tell me with what you
might be bound.” He said to her, “If you weave the seven locks of my
head with the fabric on the loom.” <span class="bibleverse">14</span>
She fastened it with the pin, and said to him, “The Philistines are on
you, Samson!” He awakened out of his sleep, and plucked away the pin of
the beam and the fabric. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> She said to
him, “How can you say, ‘I love you,’ when your heart is not with me? You
have mocked me these three times, and have not told me where your great
strength lies.” <span class="bibleverse">16</span> When she pressed him
daily with her words and urged him, his soul was troubled to death.
<span class="bibleverse">17</span> He told her all his heart and said to
her, “No razor has ever come on my head; for I have been a Nazirite to
God from my mother’s womb. If I am shaved, then my strength will go from
me and I will become weak, and be like any other man.” <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> When Delilah saw that he had told her all
his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying,
“Come up this once, for he has told me all his heart.” Then the lords of
the Philistines came up to her and brought the money in their hand.
<span class="bibleverse">19</span> She made him sleep on her knees; and
she called for a man and shaved off the seven locks of his head; and she
began to afflict him, and his strength went from him. <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> She said, “The Philistines are upon you,
Samson!” He awoke out of his sleep, and said, “I will go out as at other
times, and shake myself free.” But he didn’t know that the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> had departed from him. <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> The Philistines laid hold on him and put
out his eyes; and they brought him down to Gaza and bound him with
fetters of bronze; and he ground at the mill in the prison. <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> However, the hair of his head began to grow
again after he was shaved.</p>
<h2

final revenge and death of the Simpsons</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">23</span> The lords of the Philistines
gathered together to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god, and to
rejoice; for they said, “Our god has delivered Samson our enemy into our
hand.” <span class="bibleverse">24</span> When the people saw him, they
praised their god; for they said, “Our god has delivered our enemy and
the destroyer of our country, who has slain many of us, into our hand.”
<span class="bibleverse">25</span> When their hearts were merry, they
said, “Call for Samson, that he may entertain us.” They called for
Samson out of the prison; and he performed before them. They set him
between the pillars; <span class="bibleverse">26</span> and Samson said
to the boy who held him by the hand, “Allow me to feel the pillars on
which the house rests, that I may lean on them.” <span
class="bibleverse">27</span> Now the house was full of men and women;
and all the lords of the Philistines were there; and there were on the
roof about three thousand men and women, who saw while Samson performed.
<span class="bibleverse">28</span> Samson called to the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and said, “Lord GOD, remember me, please,
and strengthen me, please, only this once, God, that I may be at once
avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes.” <span
class="bibleverse">29</span> Samson took hold of the two middle pillars
on which the house rested and leaned on them, the one with his right
hand and the other with his left. <span class="bibleverse">30</span>
Samson said, “Let me die with the Philistines!” He bowed himself with
all his might; and the house fell on the lords, and on all the people
who were in it. So the dead that he killed at his death were more than
those who he killed in his life. <span class="bibleverse">31</span> Then
his brothers and all the house of his father came down and took him, and
brought him up and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the burial
site of Manoah his father. He judged Israel twenty years.</p>

ears—behold, the silver is with me. I took it.” His mother said, “May
the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> bless my son!” <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> He restored the eleven hundred pieces of
silver to his mother, then his mother said, “I most certainly dedicate
the silver to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> from my hand for
my son, to make a carved image and a molten image. Now therefore I will
restore it to you.” <span class="bibleverse">4</span> When he restored
the money to his mother, his mother took two hundred pieces of silver,
and gave them to a silversmith, who made a carved image and a molten

children of Dan sent five men of their family from their whole number,
men of valour, from Zorah and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land and to
search it. They said to them, “Go, explore the land!” They came to the
hill country of Ephraim, to the house of Micah, and lodged there. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> When they were by the house of Micah, they
knew the voice of the young man the Levite; so they went over there and
said to him, “Who brought you here? What do you do in this place? What
do you have here?” <span class="bibleverse">4</span> He said to them,
“Thus and thus has Micah dealt with me, and he has hired me, and I have
become his priest.” <span class="bibleverse">5</span> They said to him,
“Please ask counsel of God, that we may know whether our way which we go
shall be prosperous.” <span class="bibleverse">6</span> The priest said
to them, “Go in peace. Your way in which you go is before the <span

the five men departed and came to Laish and saw the people who were
there, how they lived in safety, in the way of the Sidonians, quiet and
secure; for there was no one in the land possessing authority, that
might put them to shame in anything, and they were far from the
Sidonians, and had no dealings with anyone else. <span

Eshtaol; and their brothers asked them, “What do you say?” <span

peace, put your hand on your mouth, and go with us. Be a father and a
priest to us. Is it better for you to be priest to the house of one man,
or to be priest to a tribe and a family in Israel?” <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> The priest’s heart was glad, and he took
the ephod, the teraphim, and the engraved image, and went with the
people. <span class="bibleverse">21</span> So they turned and departed,
and put the little ones, the livestock, and the goods before them. <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> When they were a good way from the house of
Micah, the men who were in the houses near Micah’s house gathered
together and overtook the children of Dan. <span
class="bibleverse">23</span> As they called to the children of Dan, they
turned their faces, and said to Micah, “What ails you, that you come
with such a company?” <span class="bibleverse">24</span> He said, “You
have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest, and have gone
away! What more do I have? How can you ask me, ‘What ails you?’” <span
class="bibleverse">25</span> The children of Dan said to him, “Don’t let
your voice be heard amongst us, lest angry fellows fall on you, and you
lose your life, with the lives of your household.” <span
class="bibleverse">26</span> The children of Dan went their way; and
when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went
back to his house.</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">27</span> They took that which Micah had
made, and the priest whom he had, and came to Laish, to a people quiet
and unsuspecting, and struck them with the edge of the sword; then they
burnt the city with fire. <span class="bibleverse">28</span> There was
no deliverer, because it was far from Sidon, and they had no dealings
with anyone else; and it was in the valley that lies by Beth Rehob. They
built the city and lived in it. <span class="bibleverse">29</span> They
called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who
was born to Israel; however the name of the city used to be Laish. <span
class="bibleverse">30</span> The children of Dan set up for themselves
the engraved image; and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Moses,
and his sons were priests to the tribe of the Danites until the day of
the captivity of the land. <span class="bibleverse">31</span> So they
set up for themselves Micah’s engraved image which he made, and it
remained all the time that God’s house was in Shiloh.</p>

visit of a Levite to Bethlehem to retrieve his concubine</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> In those days, when there was no
king in Israel, there was a certain Levite living on the farther side of
the hill country of Ephraim, who took for himself a concubine out of
Bethlehem Judah. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> His concubine played
the prostitute against him, and went away from him to her father’s house
to Bethlehem Judah, and was there for four months. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> Her husband arose and went after her to
speak kindly to her, to bring her again, having his servant with him and
a couple of donkeys. She brought him into her father’s house; and when
the father of the young lady saw him, he rejoiced to meet him. <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> His father-in-law, the young lady’s father,
kept him there; and he stayed with him three days. So they ate and
drank, and stayed there. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> On the fourth
day, they got up early in the morning, and he rose up to depart. The
young lady’s father said to his son-in-law, “Strengthen your heart with
a morsel of bread, and afterward you shall go your way.” <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> So they sat down, ate, and drank, both of
them together. Then the young lady’s father said to the man, “Please be
pleased to stay all night, and let your heart be merry.” <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> The man rose up to depart; but his
father-in-law urged him, and he stayed there again. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> He arose early in the morning on the fifth
day to depart; and the young lady’s father said, “Please strengthen your
heart and stay until the day declines;” and they both ate. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> When the man rose up to depart, he, and his
concubine, and his servant, his father-in-law, the young lady’s father,
said to him, “Behold, now the day draws towards evening, please stay all
night. Behold, the day is ending. Stay here, that your heart may be
merry; and tomorrow go on your way early, that you may go home.” <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> But the man wouldn’t stay that night, but
he rose up and went near Jebus (also called Jerusalem). With him were a
couple of saddled donkeys. His concubine also was with him.</p>
<h2 id="contemplation-and-reception-of-man-in-gibeah">Contemplation and
reception of man in Gibeah</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">11</span> When they were by Jebus, the day
was far spent; and the servant said to his master, “Please come and
let’s enter into this city of the Jebusites, and stay in it.” <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> His master said to him, “We won’t enter
into the city of a foreigner that is not of the children of Israel; but
we will pass over to Gibeah.” <span class="bibleverse">13</span> He said
to his servant, “Come and let’s draw near to one of these places; and we
will lodge in Gibeah, or in Ramah.” <span class="bibleverse">14</span>
So they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down on them near
Gibeah, which belongs to Benjamin. <span class="bibleverse">15</span>
They went over there, to go in to stay in Gibeah. He went in, and sat
down in the street of the city; for there was no one who took them into
his house to stay. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> Behold, an old man
came from his work out of the field at evening. Now the man was from the
hill country of Ephraim, and he lived in Gibeah; but the men of the
place were Benjamites. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> He lifted up
his eyes, and saw the wayfaring man in the street of the city; and the
old man said, “Where are you going? Where did you come from?” <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> He said to him, “We are passing from
Bethlehem Judah to the farther side of the hill country of Ephraim. I am
from there, and I went to Bethlehem Judah. I am going to the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s house; and there is no one who has taken
me into his house. <span class="bibleverse">19</span> Yet there is both
straw and feed for our donkeys; and there is bread and wine also for me,
and for your servant, and for the young man who is with your servants.
There is no lack of anything.” <span class="bibleverse">20</span> The
old man said, “Peace be to you! Just let me supply all your needs, but
don’t sleep in the street.” <span class="bibleverse">21</span> So he
brought him into his house, and gave the donkeys fodder. Then they
washed their feet, and ate and drank.</p>
<h2 id="the-outrage-of-the-woman-and-the-return-of-the-levite">The
outrage of the woman and the return of the Levite</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">22</span> As they were making their hearts
merry, behold, the men of the city, certain wicked fellows, surrounded
the house, beating at the door; and they spoke to the master of the
house, the old man, saying, “Bring out the man who came into your house,
that we can have sex with him!” <span class="bibleverse">23</span> The
man, the master of the house, went out to them, and said to them, “No,
my brothers, please don’t act so wickedly; since this man has come into
my house, don’t do this folly. <span class="bibleverse">24</span>
Behold, here is my virgin daughter and his concubine. I will bring them
out now. Humble them, and do with them what seems good to you; but to
this man don’t do any such folly.” <span class="bibleverse">25</span>
But the men wouldn’t listen to him; so the man grabbed his concubine,
and brought her out to them; and they had sex with her, and abused her
all night until the morning. When the day began to dawn, they let her
go. <span class="bibleverse">26</span> Then the woman came in the
dawning of the day, and fell down at the door of the man’s house where
her lord was, until it was light. <span class="bibleverse">27</span> Her
lord rose up in the morning and opened the doors of the house, and went
out to go his way; and behold, the woman his concubine had fallen down
at the door of the house, with her hands on the threshold. <span
class="bibleverse">28</span> He said to her, “Get up, and let’s get
going!” but no one answered. Then he took her up on the donkey; and the
man rose up, and went to his place. <span class="bibleverse">29</span>
When he had come into his house, he took a knife and cut up his
concubine, and divided her, limb by limb, into twelve pieces, and sent
her throughout all the borders of Israel. <span
class="bibleverse">30</span> It was so, that all who saw it said, “Such
a deed has not been done or seen from the day that the children of
Israel came up out of the land of Egypt to this day! Consider it, take
counsel, and speak.”</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Then all the children of Israel
went out, and the congregation was assembled as one man, from Dan even
to Beersheba, with the land of Gilead, to the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> at Mizpah. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> The chiefs of all the people, even of all
the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people
of God, four hundred thousand footmen who drew sword. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> (Now the children of Benjamin heard that the
children of Israel had gone up to Mizpah.) The children of Israel said,
“Tell us, how did this wickedness happen?” <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> The Levite, the husband of the woman who was
murdered, answered, “I came into Gibeah that belongs to Benjamin, I and
my concubine, to spend the night. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> The
men of Gibeah rose against me, and surrounded the house by night. They
intended to kill me and they raped my concubine, and she is dead. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> I took my concubine and cut her in pieces,
and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel;
for they have committed lewdness and folly in Israel. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> Behold, you children of Israel, all of you,
give here your advice and counsel.” <span class="bibleverse">8</span>
All the people arose as one man, saying, “None of us will go to his
tent, neither will any of us turn to his house. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> But now this is the thing which we will do
to Gibeah: we will go up against it by lot; <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> and we will take ten men of one hundred
throughout all the tribes of Israel, and one hundred of one thousand,
and a thousand out of ten thousand to get food for the people, that they
may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, according to all the folly
that the men of Gibeah have done in Israel.” <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> So all the men of Israel were gathered
against the city, knit together as one man.</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">12</span> The tribes of Israel sent men
through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, “What wickedness is this that
has happened amongst you? <span class="bibleverse">13</span> Now
therefore deliver up the men, the wicked fellows who are in Gibeah, that
we may put them to death and put away evil from Israel.” But Benjamin
would not listen to the voice of their brothers, the children of Israel.
<span class="bibleverse">14</span> The children of Benjamin gathered
themselves together out of the cities to Gibeah, to go out to battle
against the children of Israel. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> The
children of Benjamin were counted on that day out of the cities
twenty-six thousand men who drew the sword, in addition to the
inhabitants of Gibeah, who were counted seven hundred chosen men. <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> Amongst all these soldiers there were seven
hundred chosen men who were left-handed. Every one of them could sling a
stone at a hair and not miss. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> The men
of Israel, besides Benjamin, were counted four hundred thousand men who
drew sword. All these were men of war.</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">18</span> The children of Israel arose, went
up to Bethel, and asked counsel of God. They asked, “Who shall go up for
us first to battle against the children of Benjamin?” The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> said, “Judah first.” <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> The children of Israel rose up in the
morning and encamped against Gibeah. <span class="bibleverse">20</span>
The men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and the men of
Israel set the battle in array against them at Gibeah. <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> The children of Benjamin came out of
Gibeah, and on that day destroyed twenty-two thousand of the Israelite
men down to the ground. <span class="bibleverse">22</span> The people,
the men of Israel, encouraged themselves, and set the battle again in
array in the place where they set themselves in array the first day.
<span class="bibleverse">23</span> The children of Israel went up and
wept before the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> until evening; and
they asked of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, saying, “Shall I
again draw near to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother?”
The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> said, “Go up against him.” <span
class="bibleverse">24</span> The children of Israel came near against
the children of Benjamin the second day. <span
class="bibleverse">25</span> Benjamin went out against them out of
Gibeah the second day, and destroyed down to the ground of the children
of Israel again eighteen thousand men. All these drew the sword. <span
class="bibleverse">26</span> Then all the children of Israel and all the
people went up, and came to Bethel, and wept, and sat there before the
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and fasted that day until evening;
then they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the <span

children of Israel asked the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> (for
the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days, <span
class="bibleverse">28</span> and Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son
of Aaron, stood before it in those days), saying, “Shall I yet again go
out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I
cease?” The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> said, “Go up; for
tomorrow I will deliver him into your hand.”</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">29</span> Israel set ambushes all around
Gibeah. <span class="bibleverse">30</span> The children of Israel went
up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and set themselves
in array against Gibeah, as at other times. <span
class="bibleverse">31</span> The children of Benjamin went out against
the people, and were drawn away from the city; and they began to strike
and kill of the people as at other times, in the highways, of which one
goes up to Bethel and the other to Gibeah, in the field, about thirty
men of Israel. <span class="bibleverse">32</span> The children of
Benjamin said, “They are struck down before us, as at the first.” But
the children of Israel said, “Let’s flee, and draw them away from the
city to the highways.” <span class="bibleverse">33</span> All the men of
Israel rose up out of their place and set themselves in array at Baal
Tamar. Then the ambushers of Israel broke out of their place, even out
of Maareh Geba. <span class="bibleverse">34</span> Ten thousand chosen
men out of all Israel came over against Gibeah, and the battle was
severe; but they didn’t know that disaster was close to them. <span
class="bibleverse">35</span> The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>
struck Benjamin before Israel; and the children of Israel destroyed of
Benjamin that day twenty-five thousand and one hundred men. All these
drew the sword. <span class="bibleverse">36</span> So the children of
Benjamin saw that they were struck, for the men of Israel yielded to
Benjamin because they trusted the ambushers whom they had set against
Gibeah. <span class="bibleverse">37</span> The ambushers hurried, and
rushed on Gibeah; then the ambushers spread out, and struck all the city
with the edge of the sword. <span class="bibleverse">38</span> Now the
appointed sign between the men of Israel and the ambushers was that they
should make a great cloud of smoke rise up out of the city. <span
class="bibleverse">39</span> The men of Israel turned in the battle, and
Benjamin began to strike and kill of the men of Israel about thirty
persons; for they said, “Surely they are struck down before us, as in
the first battle.” <span class="bibleverse">40</span> But when the cloud
began to arise up out of the city in a pillar of smoke, the Benjamites
looked behind them; and behold, the whole city went up in smoke to the
sky. <span class="bibleverse">41</span> The men of Israel turned, and
the men of Benjamin were dismayed; for they saw that disaster had come
on them. <span class="bibleverse">42</span> Therefore they turned their
backs before the men of Israel to the way of the wilderness, but the
battle followed hard after them; and those who came out of the cities
destroyed them in the middle of it. <span class="bibleverse">43</span>
They surrounded the Benjamites, chased them, and trod them down at their
resting place, as far as near Gibeah towards the sunrise. <span
class="bibleverse">44</span> Eighteen thousand men of Benjamin fell; all
these were men of valour. <span class="bibleverse">45</span> They turned
and fled towards the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon. They gleaned five
thousand men of them in the highways, and followed hard after them to
Gidom, and struck two thousand men of them. <span
class="bibleverse">46</span> So that all who fell that day of Benjamin
were twenty-five thousand men who drew the sword. All these were men of
valour. <span class="bibleverse">47</span> But six hundred men turned
and fled towards the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, and stayed in the
rock of Rimmon four months. <span class="bibleverse">48</span> The men
of Israel turned again on the children of Benjamin, and struck them with
the edge of the sword—including the entire city, the livestock, and all
that they found. Moreover they set all the cities which they found on
fire.</p>

Grief; the Benjaminites are assigned maidens from the city of Jabez</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Now the men of Israel had sworn in
Mizpah, saying, “None of us will give his daughter to Benjamin as a
wife.” <span class="bibleverse">2</span> The people came to Bethel and
sat there until evening before God, and lifted up their voices, and wept
severely. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> They said, “The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, why has this happened
in Israel, that there should be one tribe lacking in Israel today?”
<span class="bibleverse">4</span> On the next day, the people rose early
and built an altar there, and offered burnt offerings and peace
offerings. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> The children of Israel
said, “Who is there amongst all the tribes of Israel who didn’t come up
in the assembly to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>?” For they
had made a great oath concerning him who didn’t come up to the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> to Mizpah, saying, “He shall surely be put
to death.” <span class="bibleverse">6</span> The children of Israel
grieved for Benjamin their brother, and said, “There is one tribe cut
off from Israel today. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> How shall we
provide wives for those who remain, since we have sworn by the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> that we will not give them of our
daughters to wives?” <span class="bibleverse">8</span> They said, “What
one is there of the tribes of Israel who didn’t come up to the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> to Mizpah?” Behold, no one came from
Jabesh Gilead to the camp to the assembly. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> For when the people were counted, behold,
there were none of the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead there. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> The congregation sent twelve thousand of
the most valiant men there, and commanded them, saying, “Go and strike
the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead with the edge of the sword, with the
women and the little ones. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> This is
the thing that you shall do: you shall utterly destroy every male, and
every woman who has lain with a man.” <span class="bibleverse">12</span>
They found amongst the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead four hundred young
virgins who had not known man by lying with him; and they brought them
to the camp to Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> The whole congregation sent and spoke to
the children of Benjamin who were in the rock of Rimmon, and proclaimed
peace to them. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> Benjamin returned at
that time; and they gave them the women whom they had saved alive of the
women of Jabesh Gilead. There still weren’t enough for them.</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">15</span> The people grieved for Benjamin,
because the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> had made a breach in the
tribes of Israel. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> Then the elders of
the congregation said, “How shall we provide wives for those who remain,
since the women are destroyed out of Benjamin?” <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> They said, “There must be an inheritance
for those who are escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe not be blotted out
from Israel. <span class="bibleverse">18</span> However, we may not give
them wives of our daughters, for the children of Israel had sworn,
saying, ‘Cursed is he who gives a wife to Benjamin.’” <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> They said, “Behold, there is a feast of the
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> from year to year in Shiloh, which
is on the north of Bethel, on the east side of the highway that goes up
from Bethel to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.” <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> They commanded the children of Benjamin,
saying, “Go and lie in wait in the vineyards, <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> and see, and behold, if the daughters of
Shiloh come out to dance in the dances, then come out of the vineyards,
and each man catch his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the
land of Benjamin. <span class="bibleverse">22</span> It shall be, when
their fathers or their brothers come to complain to us, that we will say
to them, ‘Grant them graciously to us, because we didn’t take for each
man his wife in battle, neither did you give them to them; otherwise you
would now be guilty.’” <span class="bibleverse">23</span> The children
of Benjamin did so, and took wives for themselves according to their
number, of those who danced, whom they carried off. They went and
returned to their inheritance, built the cities, and lived in them.
<span class="bibleverse">24</span> The children of Israel departed from
there at that time, every man to his tribe and to his family, and they
each went out from there to his own inheritance. <span
class="bibleverse">25</span> In those days there was no king in Israel.
Everyone did that which was right in his own eyes.</p>
