<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Now king David was old and advanced
in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he couldn’t keep warm.
<span class="bibleverse">2</span> Therefore his servants said to him,
“Let a young virgin be sought for my lord the king. Let her stand before
the king, and cherish him; and let her lie in your bosom, that my lord
the king may keep warm.” <span class="bibleverse">3</span> So they
sought for a beautiful young lady throughout all the borders of Israel,
and found Abishag the Shunammite, and brought her to the king. <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> The young lady was very beautiful; and she
cherished the king, and served him; but the king didn’t know her
intimately.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">5</span> Then Adonijah the son of Haggith
exalted himself, saying, “I will be king.” Then he prepared him chariots
and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> His father had not displeased him at any
time in saying, “Why have you done so?” and he was also a very handsome
man; and he was born after Absalom. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> He
conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah and with Abiathar the priest; and
they followed Adonijah and helped him. <span class="bibleverse">8</span>
But Zadok the priest, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, Nathan the prophet,
Shimei, Rei, and the mighty men who belonged to David, were not with
Adonijah.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">9</span> Adonijah killed sheep, cattle, and
fatlings by the stone of Zoheleth, which is beside En Rogel; and he
called all his brothers, the king’s sons, and all the men of Judah, the
king’s servants; <span class="bibleverse">10</span> but he didn’t call
Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his
brother.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">11</span> Then Nathan spoke to Bathsheba the
mother of Solomon, saying, “Haven’t you heard that Adonijah the son of
Haggith reigns, and David our lord doesn’t know it? <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> Now therefore come, please let me give you
counsel, that you may save your own life and your son Solomon’s life.
<span class="bibleverse">13</span> Go in to king David, and tell him,
‘Didn’t you, my lord the king, swear to your servant, saying, “Assuredly
Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne?”
Why then does Adonijah reign?’ <span class="bibleverse">14</span>
Behold,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> while you are still talking there
with the king, I will also come in after you and confirm your
words.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">15</span> Bathsheba went in to the king in
his room. The king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite was serving
the king. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> Bathsheba bowed and showed
respect to the king. The king said, “What would you like?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">17</span> She said to him, “My lord, you
swore by the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span><a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>
your God<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> to your servant, ‘Assuredly Solomon
your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne.’ <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> Now, behold, Adonijah reigns; and you, my
lord the king, don’t know it. <span class="bibleverse">19</span> He has
slain cattle and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and has called all the
sons of the king, Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the army;
but he hasn’t called Solomon your servant. <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> You, my lord the king, the eyes of all
Israel are on you, that you should tell them who will sit on the throne
of my lord the king after him. <span class="bibleverse">21</span>
Otherwise it will happen, when my lord the king sleeps with his fathers,
that I and my son Solomon will be considered criminals.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">22</span> Behold, while she was still
talking with the king, Nathan the prophet came in. <span
class="bibleverse">23</span> They told the king, saying, “Behold, Nathan
the prophet!”</p>
<p>When he had come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king
with his face to the ground. <span class="bibleverse">24</span> Nathan
said, “My lord, king, have you said, ‘Adonijah shall reign after me, and
he shall sit on my throne?’ <span class="bibleverse">25</span> For he
has gone down today, and has slain cattle, fatlings, and sheep in
abundance, and has called all the king’s sons, the captains of the army,
and Abiathar the priest. Behold, they are eating and drinking before
him, and saying, ‘Long live king Adonijah!’ <span
class="bibleverse">26</span> But he hasn’t called me, even me your
servant, Zadok the priest, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and your servant
Solomon. <span class="bibleverse">27</span> Was this thing done by my
lord the king, and you haven’t shown to your servants who should sit on
the throne of my lord the king after him?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">28</span> Then king David answered, “Call
Bathsheba in to me.” She came into the king’s presence and stood before
the king. <span class="bibleverse">29</span> The king vowed and said,
“As the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> lives, who has redeemed my
soul out of all adversity, <span class="bibleverse">30</span> most
certainly as I swore to you by the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>,
the God of Israel, saying, ‘Assuredly Solomon your son shall reign after
me, and he shall sit on my throne in my place;’ I will most certainly do
this today.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">31</span> Then Bathsheba bowed with her face
to the earth and showed respect to the king, and said, “Let my lord king
David live forever!”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">32</span> King David said, “Call to me Zadok
the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada.” They
came before the king. <span class="bibleverse">33</span> The king said
to them, “Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my
son to ride on my own mule, and bring him down to Gihon. <span
class="bibleverse">34</span> Let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet
anoint him there king over Israel. Blow the trumpet, and say, ‘Long live
king Solomon!’ <span class="bibleverse">35</span> Then come up after
him, and he shall come and sit on my throne; for he shall be king in my
place. I have appointed him to be prince over Israel and over
Judah.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">36</span> Benaiah the son of Jehoiada
answered the king, and said, “Amen. May the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the God of my lord the king, say so.
<span class="bibleverse">37</span> As the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> has been with my lord the king, even so
may he be with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of
my lord king David.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">38</span> So Zadok the priest, Nathan the
prophet, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the
Pelethites went down and had Solomon ride on king David’s mule, and
brought him to Gihon. <span class="bibleverse">39</span> Zadok the
priest took the horn of oil from the Tent, and anointed Solomon. They
blew the trumpet; and all the people said, “Long live king Solomon!”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">40</span> All the people came up after him,
and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that
the earth shook with their sound. <span class="bibleverse">41</span>
Adonijah and all the guests who were with him heard it as they had
finished eating. When Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, “Why
is this noise of the city being in an uproar?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">42</span> While he yet spoke, behold,
Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came; and Adonijah said, “Come
in; for you are a worthy man, and bring good news.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">43</span> Jonathan answered Adonijah, “Most
certainly our lord king David has made Solomon king. <span
class="bibleverse">44</span> The king has sent with him Zadok the
priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the
Cherethites and the Pelethites; and they have caused him to ride on the
king’s mule. <span class="bibleverse">45</span> Zadok the priest and
Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon. They have come up
from there rejoicing, so that the city rang again. This is the noise
that you have heard. <span class="bibleverse">46</span> Also, Solomon
sits on the throne of the kingdom. <span class="bibleverse">47</span>
Moreover the king’s servants came to bless our lord king David, saying,
‘May your God make the name of Solomon better than your name, and make
his throne greater than your throne;’ and the king bowed himself on the
bed. <span class="bibleverse">48</span> Also thus said the king,
‘Blessed be the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel,
who has given one to sit on my throne today, my eyes even seeing
it.’”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">49</span> All the guests of Adonijah were
afraid, and rose up, and each man went his way. <span
class="bibleverse">50</span> Adonijah was afraid because of Solomon; and
he arose, and went, and hung onto the horns of the altar. <span
class="bibleverse">51</span> Solomon was told, “Behold, Adonijah fears
king Solomon; for, behold, he is hanging onto the horns of the altar,
saying, ‘Let king Solomon swear to me first that he will not kill his
servant with the sword.’”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">52</span> Solomon said, “If he shows himself
a worthy man, not a hair of his shall fall to the earth; but if
wickedness is found in him, he shall die.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">53</span> So king Solomon sent, and they
brought him down from the altar. He came and bowed down to king Solomon;
and Solomon said to him, “Go to your house.”</p>
<h1 id="section-1">2</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Now the days of David came near
that he should die; and he commanded Solomon his son, saying, <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> “I am going the way of all the earth. You be
strong therefore, and show yourself a man; <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> and keep the instruction of the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> your God, to walk in his ways, to keep his
statutes, his commandments, his ordinances, and his testimonies,
according to that which is written in the law of Moses, that you may
prosper in all that you do and wherever you turn yourself. <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> Then the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>
may establish his word which he spoke concerning me, saying, ‘If your
children are careful of their way, to walk before me in truth with all
their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail you,’ he said,
‘a man on the throne of Israel.’</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">5</span> “Moreover you know also what Joab
the son of Zeruiah did to me, even what he did to the two captains of
the armies of Israel, to Abner the son of Ner and to Amasa the son of
Jether, whom he killed, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the
blood of war on his sash that was around his waist and in his sandals
that were on his feet. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> Do therefore
according to your wisdom, and don’t let his grey head go down to Sheol<a
href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> in peace. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> But show kindness to the sons of Barzillai
the Gileadite, and let them be amongst those who eat at your table; for
so they came to me when I fled from Absalom your brother.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">8</span> “Behold, there is with you Shimei
the son of Gera, the Benjamite of Bahurim, who cursed me with a grievous
curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim; but he came down to meet me at
the Jordan, and I swore to him by the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, saying, ‘I will not put you to death with
the sword.’ <span class="bibleverse">9</span> Now therefore don’t hold
him guiltless, for you are a wise man; and you will know what you ought
to do to him, and you shall bring his grey head down to Sheol<a
href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> with blood.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">10</span> David slept with his fathers, and
was buried in David’s city. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> The days
that David reigned over Israel were forty years; he reigned seven years
in Hebron, and he reigned thirty-three years in Jerusalem. <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> Solomon sat on David his father’s throne;
and his kingdom was firmly established.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">13</span> Then Adonijah the son of Haggith
came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon. She said, “Do you come
peaceably?”</p>
<p>He said, “Peaceably. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> He said
moreover, I have something to tell you.”</p>
<p>She said, “Say on.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">15</span> He said, “You know that the
kingdom was mine, and that all Israel set their faces on me, that I
should reign. However, the kingdom is turned around, and has become my
brother’s; for it was his from the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>.
<span class="bibleverse">16</span> Now I ask one petition of you. Don’t
deny me.”</p>
<p>She said to him, “Say on.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">17</span> He said, “Please speak to Solomon
the king (for he will not tell you ‘no’), that he give me Abishag the
Shunammite as wife.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">18</span> Bathsheba said, “All right. I will
speak for you to the king.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">19</span> Bathsheba therefore went to king
Solomon, to speak to him for Adonijah. The king rose up to meet her and
bowed himself to her, and sat down on his throne and caused a throne to
be set for the king’s mother; and she sat on his right hand. <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> Then she said, “I ask one small petition of
you; don’t deny me.”</p>
<p>The king said to her, “Ask on, my mother, for I will not deny
you.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">21</span> She said, “Let Abishag the
Shunammite be given to Adonijah your brother as wife.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">22</span> King Solomon answered his mother,
“Why do you ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? Ask for him the
kingdom also, for he is my elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar
the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.” <span
class="bibleverse">23</span> Then king Solomon swore by the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, saying, “God do so to me, and more also,
if Adonijah has not spoken this word against his own life. <span
class="bibleverse">24</span> Now therefore as the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> lives, who has established me and set me
on my father David’s throne, and who has made me a house as he promised,
surely Adonijah shall be put to death today.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">25</span> King Solomon sent Benaiah the son
of Jehoiada; and he fell on him, so that he died. <span
class="bibleverse">26</span> To Abiathar the priest the king said, “Go
to Anathoth, to your own fields, for you are worthy of death. But I will
not at this time put you to death, because you bore the Lord<a
href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> GOD’s ark before David my father,
and because you were afflicted in all in which my father was afflicted.”
<span class="bibleverse">27</span> So Solomon thrust Abiathar out from
being priest to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, that he might
fulfil the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s word which he spoke
concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">28</span> This news came to Joab; for Joab
had followed Adonijah, although he didn’t follow Absalom. Joab fled to
the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s Tent, and held onto the horns
of the altar. <span class="bibleverse">29</span> King Solomon was told,
“Joab has fled to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s Tent; and
behold, he is by the altar.” Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of
Jehoiada, saying, “Go, fall on him.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">30</span> Benaiah came to the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s Tent, and said to him, “The king says,
‘Come out!’”</p>
<p>He said, “No; but I will die here.”</p>
<p>Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, “This is what Joab said,
and this is how he answered me.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">31</span> The king said to him, “Do as he
has said, and fall on him, and bury him, that you may take away the
blood, which Joab shed without cause, from me and from my father’s
house. <span class="bibleverse">32</span> The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> will return his blood on his own head,
because he fell on two men more righteous and better than he, and killed
them with the sword, and my father David didn’t know it: Abner the son
of Ner, captain of the army of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether,
captain of the army of Judah. <span class="bibleverse">33</span> So
their blood will return on the head of Joab and on the head of his
offspring<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> forever. But for David, for his
offspring, for his house, and for his throne, there will be peace
forever from the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">34</span> Then Benaiah the son of Jehoiada
went up and fell on him, and killed him; and he was buried in his own
house in the wilderness. <span class="bibleverse">35</span> The king put
Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his place over the army; and the king put
Zadok the priest in the place of Abiathar.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">36</span> The king sent and called for
Shimei, and said to him, “Build yourself a house in Jerusalem, and live
there, and don’t go anywhere else. <span class="bibleverse">37</span>
For on the day you go out and pass over the brook Kidron, know for
certain that you will surely die. Your blood will be on your own
head.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">38</span> Shimei said to the king, “What you
say is good. As my lord the king has said, so will your servant do.”
Shimei lived in Jerusalem many days.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">39</span> At the end of three years, two of
Shimei’s slaves ran away to Achish, son of Maacah, king of Gath. They
told Shimei, saying, “Behold, your slaves are in Gath.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">40</span> Shimei arose, saddled his donkey,
and went to Gath to Achish to seek his slaves; and Shimei went and
brought his slaves from Gath. <span class="bibleverse">41</span> Solomon
was told that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and had come
again.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">42</span> The king sent and called for
Shimei, and said to him, “Didn’t I adjure you by the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> and warn you, saying, ‘Know for certain
that on the day you go out and walk anywhere else, you shall surely
die?’ You said to me, ‘The saying that I have heard is good.’ <span
class="bibleverse">43</span> Why then have you not kept the oath of the
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> and the commandment that I have
instructed you with?” <span class="bibleverse">44</span> The king said
moreover to Shimei, “You know in your heart all the wickedness that you
did to David my father. Therefore the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> will return your wickedness on your own
head. <span class="bibleverse">45</span> But king Solomon will be
blessed, and David’s throne will be established before the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> forever.” <span
class="bibleverse">46</span> So the king commanded Benaiah the son of
Jehoiada; and he went out, and fell on him, so that he died. The kingdom
was established in the hand of Solomon.</p>
<h1 id="section-2">3</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Solomon made a marriage alliance
with Pharaoh king of Egypt. He took Pharaoh’s daughter and brought her
into David’s city until he had finished building his own house, the
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s house, and the wall around
Jerusalem. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> However, the people
sacrificed in the high places, because there was not yet a house built
for the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s name. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> Solomon loved the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, walking in the statutes of David his
father, except that he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.
<span class="bibleverse">4</span> The king went to Gibeon to sacrifice
there, for that was the great high place. Solomon offered a thousand
burnt offerings on that altar. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> In
Gibeon, the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> appeared to Solomon in a
dream by night; and God said, “Ask for what I should give you.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">6</span> Solomon said, “You have shown to
your servant David my father great loving kindness, because he walked
before you in truth, in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with
you. You have kept for him this great loving kindness, that you have
given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is today. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> Now, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> my
God, you have made your servant king instead of David my father. I am
just a little child. I don’t know how to go out or come in. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> Your servant is amongst your people which
you have chosen, a great people, that can’t be numbered or counted for
multitude. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> Give your servant therefore
an understanding heart to judge your people, that I may discern between
good and evil; for who is able to judge this great people of yours?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">10</span> This request pleased the Lord,
that Solomon had asked this thing. <span class="bibleverse">11</span>
God said to him, “Because you have asked this thing, and have not asked
for yourself long life, nor have you asked for riches for yourself, nor
have you asked for the life of your enemies, but have asked for yourself
understanding to discern justice, <span class="bibleverse">12</span>
behold, I have done according to your word. Behold, I have given you a
wise and understanding heart, so that there has been no one like you
before you, and after you none will arise like you. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> I have also given you that which you have
not asked, both riches and honour, so that there will not be any amongst
the kings like you for all your days. <span class="bibleverse">14</span>
If you will walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as
your father David walked, then I will lengthen your days.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">15</span> Solomon awoke; and behold, it was
a dream. Then he came to Jerusalem and stood before the ark of the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s covenant, and offered up burnt
offerings, offered peace offerings, and made a feast for all his
servants.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">16</span> Then two women who were
prostitutes came to the king, and stood before him. <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> The one woman said, “Oh, my lord, I and
this woman dwell in one house. I delivered a child with her in the
house. <span class="bibleverse">18</span> The third day after I
delivered, this woman delivered also. We were together. There was no
stranger with us in the house, just us two in the house. <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> This woman’s child died in the night,
because she lay on it. <span class="bibleverse">20</span> She arose at
midnight, and took my son from beside me while your servant slept, and
laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom. <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> When I rose in the morning to nurse my
child, behold, he was dead; but when I had looked at him in the morning,
behold, it was not my son whom I bore.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">22</span> The other woman said, “No! But the
living one is my son, and the dead one is your son.”</p>
<p>The first one said, “No! But the dead one is your son, and the living
one is my son.” They argued like this before the king.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">23</span> Then the king said, “One says,
‘This is my son who lives, and your son is the dead;’ and the other
says, ‘No! But your son is the dead one, and my son is the living
one.’”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">24</span> The king said, “Get me a sword.”
So they brought a sword before the king.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">25</span> The king said, “Divide the living
child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">26</span> Then the woman whose the living
child was spoke to the king, for her heart yearned over her son, and she
said, “Oh, my lord, give her the living child, and in no way kill
him!”</p>
<p>But the other said, “He shall be neither mine nor yours. Divide
him.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">27</span> Then the king answered, “Give the
first woman the living child, and definitely do not kill him. She is his
mother.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">28</span> All Israel heard of the judgement
which the king had judged; and they feared the king, for they saw that
the wisdom of God was in him to do justice.</p>
<h1 id="section-3">4</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> King Solomon was king over all
Israel. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> These were the princes whom he
had: Azariah the son of Zadok, the priest; <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> Elihoreph and Ahijah, the sons of Shisha,
scribes; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, the recorder; <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the
army; Zadok and Abiathar were priests; <span class="bibleverse">5</span>
Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers; Zabud the son of Nathan
was chief minister, the king’s friend; <span class="bibleverse">6</span>
Ahishar was over the household; and Adoniram the son of Abda was over
the men subject to forced labour.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">7</span> Solomon had twelve officers over
all Israel, who provided food for the king and his household. Each man
had to make provision for a month in the year. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> These are their names: Ben Hur, in the hill
country of Ephraim; <span class="bibleverse">9</span> Ben Deker, in
Makaz, in Shaalbim, Beth Shemesh, and Elon Beth Hanan; <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> Ben Hesed, in Arubboth (Socoh and all the
land of Hepher belonged to him); <span class="bibleverse">11</span> Ben
Abinadab, in all the height of Dor (he had Taphath, Solomon’s daughter,
as wife); <span class="bibleverse">12</span> Baana the son of Ahilud, in
Taanach and Megiddo, and all Beth Shean which is beside Zarethan,
beneath Jezreel, from Beth Shean to Abel Meholah, as far as beyond
Jokmeam; <span class="bibleverse">13</span> Ben Geber, in Ramoth Gilead
(the towns of Jair the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead, belonged to
him; and the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, sixty great cities
with walls and bronze bars, belonged to him); <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> Ahinadab the son of Iddo, in Mahanaim;
<span class="bibleverse">15</span> Ahimaaz, in Naphtali (he also took
Basemath the daughter of Solomon as wife); <span

Bealoth; <span class="bibleverse">17</span> Jehoshaphat the son of
Paruah, in Issachar; <span class="bibleverse">18</span> Shimei the son
of Ela, in Benjamin; <span class="bibleverse">19</span> Geber the son of
Uri, in the land of Gilead, the country of Sihon king of the Amorites
and of Og king of Bashan; and he was the only officer who was in the
land.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">20</span> Judah and Israel were numerous as
the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking and
making merry. <span class="bibleverse">21</span> Solomon ruled over all
the kingdoms from the River to the land of the Philistines, and to the
border of Egypt. They brought tribute and served Solomon all the days of
his life. <span class="bibleverse">22</span> Solomon’s provision for one
day was thirty cors<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> of fine flour, sixty measures of
meal, <span class="bibleverse">23</span> ten head of fat cattle, twenty
head of cattle out of the pastures, and one hundred sheep, in addition
to deer, gazelles, roebucks, and fattened fowl. <span
class="bibleverse">24</span> For he had dominion over all on this side
the River, from Tiphsah even to Gaza, over all the kings on this side
the River; and he had peace on all sides around him. <span
class="bibleverse">25</span> Judah and Israel lived safely, every man
under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beersheba, all
the days of Solomon. <span class="bibleverse">26</span> Solomon had
forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand
horsemen. <span class="bibleverse">27</span> Those officers provided
food for king Solomon, and for all who came to king Solomon’s table,
every man in his month. They let nothing be lacking. <span
class="bibleverse">28</span> They also brought barley and straw for the
horses and swift steeds to the place where the officers were, each man
according to his duty. <span class="bibleverse">29</span> God gave
Solomon abundant wisdom, understanding, and breadth of mind like the
sand that is on the seashore. <span class="bibleverse">30</span>
Solomon’s wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east and
all the wisdom of Egypt. <span class="bibleverse">31</span> For he was
wiser than all men—wiser than Ethan the Ezrahite, Heman, Calcol, and
Darda, the sons of Mahol; and his fame was in all the nations all
around. <span class="bibleverse">32</span> He spoke three thousand
proverbs, and his songs numbered one thousand and five. <span
class="bibleverse">33</span> He spoke of trees, from the cedar that is
in Lebanon even to the hyssop that grows out of the wall; he also spoke
of animals, of birds, of creeping things, and of fish. <span
class="bibleverse">34</span> People of all nations came to hear the
wisdom of Solomon, sent by all kings of the earth who had heard of his
wisdom.</p>
<h1 id="section-4">5</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Hiram king of Tyre sent his
servants to Solomon, for he had heard that they had anointed him king in
the place of his father, and Hiram had always loved David. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> Solomon sent to Hiram, saying, <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> “You know that David my father could not
build a house for the name of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>
his God because of the wars which were around him on every side, until
the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> put his enemies under the soles
of his feet. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> But now the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> my God has given me rest on every side.
There is no enemy and no evil occurrence. <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> Behold, I intend to build a house for the
name of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> my God, as the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> spoke to David my father, saying, ‘Your
son, whom I will set on your throne in your place shall build the house
for my name.’ <span class="bibleverse">6</span> Now therefore command
that cedar trees be cut for me out of Lebanon. My servants will be with
your servants; and I will give you wages for your servants according to
all that you say. For you know that there is nobody amongst us who knows
how to cut timber like the Sidonians.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">7</span> When Hiram heard the words of
Solomon, he rejoiced greatly, and said, “Blessed is the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> today, who has given to David a wise son
to rule over this great people.” <span class="bibleverse">8</span> Hiram
sent to Solomon, saying, “I have heard the message which you have sent
to me. I will do all your desire concerning timber of cedar, and
concerning cypress timber. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> My servants
will bring them down from Lebanon to the sea. I will make them into
rafts to go by sea to the place that you specify to me, and will cause
them to be broken up there, and you will receive them. You will
accomplish my desire, in giving food for my household.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">10</span> So Hiram gave Solomon cedar timber
and cypress timber according to all his desire. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand cors<a
href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> of wheat for food to his household,
and twenty cors<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> of pure oil. Solomon gave this to
Hiram year by year. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him.
There was peace between Hiram and Solomon, and the two of them made a
treaty together.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">13</span> King Solomon raised a levy out of
all Israel; and the levy was thirty thousand men. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> He sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a
month by courses: for a month they were in Lebanon, and two months at
home; and Adoniram was over the men subject to forced labour. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> Solomon had seventy thousand who bore
burdens, and eighty thousand who were stone cutters in the mountains,
<span class="bibleverse">16</span> besides Solomon’s chief officers who
were over the work: three thousand and three hundred who ruled over the
people who laboured in the work. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> The
king commanded, and they cut out large stones, costly stones, to lay the
foundation of the house with worked stone. <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> Solomon’s builders and Hiram’s builders and
the Gebalites cut them, and prepared the timber and the stones to build
the house.</p>
<h1 id="section-5">6</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> In the four hundred and eightieth
year after the children of Israel had come out of the land of Egypt, in
the fourth year of Solomon’s reign over Israel, in the month Ziv, which
is the second month, he began to build the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s house. <span class="bibleverse">2</span>
The house which king Solomon built for the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> had a length of sixty cubits,<a
href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> and its width twenty, and its
height thirty cubits. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> The porch in
front of the temple of the house had a length of twenty cubits, which
was along the width of the house. Ten cubits was its width in front of
the house. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> He made windows of fixed
lattice work for the house. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> Against
the wall of the house, he built floors all around, against the walls of
the house all around, both of the temple and of the inner sanctuary; and
he made side rooms all around. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> The
lowest floor was five cubits wide, and the middle was six cubits wide,
and the third was seven cubits wide; for on the outside he made offsets
in the wall of the house all around, that the beams should not be
inserted into the walls of the house. <span class="bibleverse">7</span>
The house, when it was under construction, was built of stone prepared
at the quarry; and no hammer or axe or any tool of iron was heard in the
house while it was under construction. <span class="bibleverse">8</span>
The door for the middle side rooms was in the right side of the house.
They went up by winding stairs into the middle floor, and out of the
middle into the third. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> So he built the
house and finished it; and he covered the house with beams and planks of
cedar. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> He built the floors all along
the house, each five cubits high; and they rested on the house with
timbers of cedar.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">11</span> The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s word came to Solomon, saying, <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> “Concerning this house which you are
building, if you will walk in my statutes, and execute my ordinances,
and keep all my commandments to walk in them, then I will establish my
word with you, which I spoke to David your father. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> I will dwell amongst the children of
Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">14</span> So Solomon built the house and
finished it. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> He built the walls of
the house within with boards of cedar; from the floor of the house to
the walls of the ceiling, he covered them on the inside with wood. He
covered the floor of the house with cypress boards. <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> He built twenty cubits of the back part of
the house with boards of cedar from the floor to the ceiling. He built
this within, for an inner sanctuary, even for the most holy place. <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> In front of the temple sanctuary was forty
cubits long. <span class="bibleverse">18</span> There was cedar on the
house within, carved with buds and open flowers. All was cedar. No stone
was visible. <span class="bibleverse">19</span> He prepared an inner
sanctuary in the middle of the house within, to set the ark of the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s covenant there. <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> Within the inner sanctuary was twenty
cubits in length, and twenty cubits in width, and twenty cubits in its
height. He overlaid it with pure gold. He covered the altar with cedar.
<span class="bibleverse">21</span> So Solomon overlaid the house within
with pure gold. He drew chains of gold across before the inner
sanctuary, and he overlaid it with gold. <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> He overlaid the whole house with gold,
until all the house was finished. He also overlaid the whole altar that
belonged to the inner sanctuary with gold.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">23</span> In the inner sanctuary he made two
cherubim<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> of olive wood, each ten cubits
high. <span class="bibleverse">24</span> Five cubits was the length of
one wing of the cherub, and five cubits was the length of the other wing
of the cherub. From the tip of one wing to the tip of the other was ten
cubits. <span class="bibleverse">25</span> The other cherub was ten
cubits. Both the cherubim were of one measure and one form. <span
class="bibleverse">26</span> One cherub was ten cubits high, and so was
the other cherub. <span class="bibleverse">27</span> He set the cherubim
within the inner house. The wings of the cherubim were stretched out, so
that the wing of the one touched the one wall and the wing of the other
cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in
the middle of the house. <span class="bibleverse">28</span> He overlaid
the cherubim with gold.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">29</span> He carved all the walls of the
house around with carved figures of cherubim, palm trees, and open
flowers, inside and outside. <span class="bibleverse">30</span> He
overlaid the floor of the house with gold, inside and outside. <span
class="bibleverse">31</span> For the entrance of the inner sanctuary, he
made doors of olive wood. The lintel and door posts were a fifth part of
the wall. <span class="bibleverse">32</span> So he made two doors of
olive wood; and he carved on them carvings of cherubim, palm trees, and
open flowers, and overlaid them with gold. He spread the gold on the
cherubim and on the palm trees. <span class="bibleverse">33</span> He
also made the entrance of the temple door posts of olive wood, out of a
fourth part of the wall, <span class="bibleverse">34</span> and two
doors of cypress wood. The two leaves of the one door were folding, and
the two leaves of the other door were folding. <span
class="bibleverse">35</span> He carved cherubim, palm trees, and open
flowers; and he overlaid them with gold fitted on the engraved work.
<span class="bibleverse">36</span> He built the inner court with three
courses of cut stone and a course of cedar beams.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">37</span> The foundation of the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s house was laid in the fourth year, in
the month Ziv. <span class="bibleverse">38</span> In the eleventh year,
in the month Bul, which is the eighth month, the house was finished
throughout all its parts and according to all its specifications. So he
spent seven years building it.</p>
<h1 id="section-6">7</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Solomon was building his own house
thirteen years, and he finished all his house. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> For he built the House of the Forest of
Lebanon. Its length was one hundred cubits,<a href="#fn13"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a>
its width fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits, on four rows of
cedar pillars, with cedar beams on the pillars. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> It was covered with cedar above over the
forty-five beams that were on the pillars, fifteen in a row. <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> There were beams in three rows, and window
was facing window in three ranks. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> All
the doors and posts were made square with beams; and window was facing
window in three ranks. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> He made the
hall of pillars. Its length was fifty cubits and its width thirty
cubits, with a porch before them, and pillars and a threshold before
them. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> He made the porch of the throne
where he was to judge, even the porch of judgement; and it was covered
with cedar from floor to floor. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> His
house where he was to dwell, the other court within the porch, was of
the same construction. He made also a house for Pharaoh’s daughter (whom
Solomon had taken as wife), like this porch. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> All these were of costly stones, even of
stone cut according to measure, sawed with saws, inside and outside,
even from the foundation to the coping, and so on the outside to the
great court. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> The foundation was of
costly stones, even great stones, stones of ten cubits and stones of
eight cubits. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> Above were costly
stones, even cut stone, according to measure, and cedar wood. <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> The great court around had three courses of
cut stone with a course of cedar beams, like the inner court of the
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s house and the porch of the
house.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">13</span> King Solomon sent and brought
Hiram out of Tyre. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> He was the son of
a widow of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a
worker in bronze; and he was filled with wisdom and understanding and
skill to work all works in bronze. He came to king Solomon and performed
all his work. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> For he fashioned the
two pillars of bronze, eighteen cubits high apiece; and a line of twelve
cubits encircled either of them. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> He
made two capitals of molten bronze to set on the tops of the pillars.
The height of the one capital was five cubits, and the height of the
other capital was five cubits. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> There
were nets of checker work and wreaths of chain work for the capitals
which were on the top of the pillars: seven for the one capital, and
seven for the other capital. <span class="bibleverse">18</span> So he
made the pillars; and there were two rows of pomegranates around the one
network, to cover the capitals that were on the top of the pillars; and
he did so for the other capital. <span class="bibleverse">19</span> The
capitals that were on the top of the pillars in the porch were of lily
work, four cubits. <span class="bibleverse">20</span> There were
capitals above also on the two pillars, close by the belly which was
beside the network. There were two hundred pomegranates in rows around
the other capital. <span class="bibleverse">21</span> He set up the
pillars at the porch of the temple. He set up the right pillar and
called its name Jachin; and he set up the left pillar and called its
name Boaz. <span class="bibleverse">22</span> On the tops of the pillars
was lily work. So the work of the pillars was finished.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">23</span> He made the molten sea ten cubits
from brim to brim, round in shape. Its height was five cubits; and a
line of thirty cubits encircled it. <span class="bibleverse">24</span>
Under its brim around there were buds which encircled it for ten cubits,
encircling the sea. The buds were in two rows, cast when it was cast.
<span class="bibleverse">25</span> It stood on twelve oxen, three
looking towards the north, and three looking towards the west, and three
looking towards the south, and three looking towards the east; and the
sea was set on them above, and all their hindquarters were inward. <span
class="bibleverse">26</span> It was a hand width thick. Its brim was
worked like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily. It held two
thousand baths.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">27</span> He made the ten bases of bronze.
The length of one base was four cubits, four cubits its width, and three
cubits its height. <span class="bibleverse">28</span> The work of the
bases was like this: they had panels; and there were panels between the
ledges; <span class="bibleverse">29</span> and on the panels that were
between the ledges were lions, oxen, and cherubim; and on the ledges
there was a pedestal above; and beneath the lions and oxen were wreaths
of hanging work. <span class="bibleverse">30</span> Every base had four
bronze wheels and axles of bronze; and its four feet had supports. The
supports were cast beneath the basin, with wreaths at the side of each.
<span class="bibleverse">31</span> Its opening within the capital and
above was a cubit. Its opening was round like the work of a pedestal, a
cubit and a half; and also on its opening were engravings, and their
panels were square, not round. <span class="bibleverse">32</span> The
four wheels were underneath the panels; and the axles of the wheels were
in the base. The height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit. <span
class="bibleverse">33</span> The work of the wheels was like the work of
a chariot wheel. Their axles, their rims, their spokes, and their hubs
were all of cast metal. <span class="bibleverse">34</span> There were
four supports at the four corners of each base. Its supports were of the
base itself. <span class="bibleverse">35</span> In the top of the base
there was a round band half a cubit high; and on the top of the base its
supports and its panels were the same. <span
class="bibleverse">36</span> On the plates of its supports and on its
panels, he engraved cherubim, lions, and palm trees, each in its space,
with wreaths all around. <span class="bibleverse">37</span> He made the
ten bases in this way: all of them had one casting, one measure, and one
form. <span class="bibleverse">38</span> He made ten basins of bronze.
One basin contained forty baths.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> Every basin measured
four cubits. One basin was on every one of the ten bases. <span
class="bibleverse">39</span> He set the bases, five on the right side of
the house and five on the left side of the house. He set the sea on the
right side of the house eastward and towards the south.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">40</span> Hiram made the pots, the shovels,
and the basins. So Hiram finished doing all the work that he worked for
king Solomon in the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s house: <span
class="bibleverse">41</span> the two pillars; the two bowls of the
capitals that were on the top of the pillars; the two networks to cover
the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars; <span
class="bibleverse">42</span> the four hundred pomegranates for the two
networks; two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two
bowls of the capitals that were on the pillars; <span
class="bibleverse">43</span> the ten bases; the ten basins on the bases;
<span class="bibleverse">44</span> the one sea; the twelve oxen under
the sea; <span class="bibleverse">45</span> the pots; the shovels; and
the basins. All of these vessels, which Hiram made for king Solomon in
the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s house, were of burnished
bronze. <span class="bibleverse">46</span> The king cast them in the
plain of the Jordan, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarethan.
<span class="bibleverse">47</span> Solomon left all the vessels
unweighed, because there were so many of them. The weight of the bronze
could not be determined.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">48</span> Solomon made all the vessels that
were in the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s house: the golden
altar and the table that the show bread was on, of gold; <span
class="bibleverse">49</span> and the lamp stands, five on the right side
and five on the left, in front of the inner sanctuary, of pure gold; and
the flowers, the lamps, and the tongs, of gold; <span
class="bibleverse">50</span> the cups, the snuffers, the basins, the
spoons, and the fire pans, of pure gold; and the hinges, both for the
doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the
house, of the temple, of gold.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">51</span> Thus all the work that king
Solomon did in the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s house was
finished. Solomon brought in the things which David his father had
dedicated—the silver, the gold, and the vessels—and put them in the
treasuries of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s house.</p>
<h1 id="section-7">8</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Then Solomon assembled the elders
of Israel with all the heads of the tribes, the princes of the fathers’
households of the children of Israel, to king Solomon in Jerusalem, to
bring up the ark of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s covenant
out of David’s city, which is Zion. <span class="bibleverse">2</span>
All the men of Israel assembled themselves to king Solomon at the feast
in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> All the elders of Israel came, and the
priests picked up the ark. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> They
brought up the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s ark, the Tent of
Meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the Tent. The priests and
the Levites brought these up. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> King
Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, who were assembled to him,
were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and cattle that could
not be counted or numbered for multitude. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> The priests brought in the ark of the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s covenant to its place, into the inner
sanctuary of the house, to the most holy place, even under the
cherubim’s wings. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> For the cherubim
spread their wings out over the place of the ark, and the cherubim
covered the ark and its poles above. <span class="bibleverse">8</span>
The poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen from the
holy place before the inner sanctuary, but they were not seen outside.
They are there to this day. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> There was
nothing in the ark except the two stone tablets which Moses put there at
Horeb, when the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> made a covenant with
the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> It came to pass, when the priests had come
out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s house, <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> so that the priests could not stand to
minister by reason of the cloud; for the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s glory filled the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s house.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">12</span> Then Solomon said, “The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> has said that he would dwell in the thick
darkness. <span class="bibleverse">13</span> I have surely built you a
house of habitation, a place for you to dwell in forever.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">14</span> The king turned his face around
and blessed all the assembly of Israel; and all the assembly of Israel
stood. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> He said, “Blessed is the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, who spoke with his
mouth to David your father, and has with his hand fulfilled it, saying,
<span class="bibleverse">16</span> ‘Since the day that I brought my
people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of
Israel to build a house, that my name might be there; but I chose David
to be over my people Israel.’</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">17</span> “Now it was in the heart of David
my father to build a house for the name of the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel. <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> But the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>
said to David my father, ‘Whereas it was in your heart to build a house
for my name, you did well that it was in your heart. <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> Nevertheless, you shall not build the
house; but your son who shall come out of your body, he shall build the
house for my name.’ <span class="bibleverse">20</span> The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> has established his word that he spoke;
for I have risen up in the place of David my father, and I sit on the
throne of Israel, as the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> promised,
and have built the house for the name of the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel. <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> There I have set a place for the ark, in
which is the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s covenant, which he
made with our fathers when he brought them out of the land of
Egypt.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">22</span> Solomon stood before the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s altar in the presence of all the
assembly of Israel, and spread out his hands towards heaven; <span
class="bibleverse">23</span> and he said, “<span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, there is no God like
you, in heaven above, or on earth beneath; who keeps covenant and loving
kindness with your servants who walk before you with all their heart;
<span class="bibleverse">24</span> who has kept with your servant David
my father that which you promised him. Yes, you spoke with your mouth,
and have fulfilled it with your hand, as it is today. <span
class="bibleverse">25</span> Now therefore, may <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, keep with your servant
David my father that which you have promised him, saying, ‘There shall
not fail from you a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel, if
only your children take heed to their way, to walk before me as you have
walked before me.’</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">26</span> “Now therefore, God of Israel,
please let your word be verified, which you spoke to your servant David
my father. <span class="bibleverse">27</span> But will God in very deed
dwell on the earth? Behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens can’t
contain you; how much less this house that I have built! <span
class="bibleverse">28</span> Yet have respect for the prayer of your
servant and for his supplication, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> my
God, to listen to the cry and to the prayer which your servant prays
before you today; <span class="bibleverse">29</span> that your eyes may
be open towards this house night and day, even towards the place of
which you have said, ‘My name shall be there;’ to listen to the prayer
which your servant prays towards this place. <span
class="bibleverse">30</span> Listen to the supplication of your servant,
and of your people Israel, when they pray towards this place. Yes, hear
in heaven, your dwelling place; and when you hear, forgive.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">31</span> “If a man sins against his
neighbour, and an oath is laid on him to cause him to swear, and he
comes and swears before your altar in this house, <span
class="bibleverse">32</span> then hear in heaven, and act, and judge
your servants, condemning the wicked, to bring his way on his own head,
and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his
righteousness.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">33</span> “When your people Israel are
struck down before the enemy because they have sinned against you, if
they turn again to you and confess your name, and pray and make
supplication to you in this house, <span class="bibleverse">34</span>
then hear in heaven, and forgive the sin of your people Israel, and
bring them again to the land which you gave to their fathers.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">35</span> “When the sky is shut up and there
is no rain because they have sinned against you, if they pray towards
this place and confess your name, and turn from their sin when you
afflict them, <span class="bibleverse">36</span> then hear in heaven,
and forgive the sin of your servants, and of your people Israel, when
you teach them the good way in which they should walk; and send rain on
your land which you have given to your people for an inheritance.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">37</span> “If there is famine in the land,
if there is pestilence, if there is blight, mildew, locust or
caterpillar; if their enemy besieges them in the land of their cities,
whatever plague, whatever sickness there is, <span
class="bibleverse">38</span> whatever prayer and supplication is made by
any man, or by all your people Israel, who shall each know the plague of
his own heart, and spread out his hands towards this house, <span
class="bibleverse">39</span> then hear in heaven, your dwelling place,
and forgive, and act, and give to every man according to all his ways,
whose heart you know (for you, even you only, know the hearts of all the
children of men); <span class="bibleverse">40</span> that they may fear
you all the days that they live in the land which you gave to our
fathers.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">41</span> “Moreover, concerning the
foreigner, who is not of your people Israel, when he comes out of a far
country for your name’s sake <span class="bibleverse">42</span> (for
they shall hear of your great name and of your mighty hand and of your
outstretched arm), when he comes and prays towards this house, <span
class="bibleverse">43</span> hear in heaven, your dwelling place, and do
according to all that the foreigner calls to you for; that all the
peoples of the earth may know your name, to fear you, as do your people
Israel, and that they may know that this house which I have built is
called by your name.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">44</span> “If your people go out to battle
against their enemy, by whatever way you shall send them, and they pray
to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> towards the city which you
have chosen, and towards the house which I have built for your name,
<span class="bibleverse">45</span> then hear in heaven their prayer and
their supplication, and maintain their cause. <span
class="bibleverse">46</span> If they sin against you (for there is no
man who doesn’t sin), and you are angry with them and deliver them to
the enemy, so that they carry them away captive to the land of the
enemy, far off or near; <span class="bibleverse">47</span> yet if they
repent in the land where they are carried captive, and turn again, and
make supplication to you in the land of those who carried them captive,
saying, ‘We have sinned and have done perversely; we have dealt
wickedly,’ <span class="bibleverse">48</span> if they return to you with
all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their enemies who
carried them captive, and pray to you towards their land which you gave
to their fathers, the city which you have chosen and the house which I
have built for your name, <span class="bibleverse">49</span> then hear
their prayer and their supplication in heaven, your dwelling place, and
maintain their cause; <span class="bibleverse">50</span> and forgive
your people who have sinned against you, and all their transgressions in
which they have transgressed against you; and give them compassion
before those who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on
them <span class="bibleverse">51</span> (for they are your people and
your inheritance, which you brought out of Egypt, from the middle of the
iron furnace); <span class="bibleverse">52</span> that your eyes may be
open to the supplication of your servant and to the supplication of your
people Israel, to listen to them whenever they cry to you. <span
class="bibleverse">53</span> For you separated them from amongst all the
peoples of the earth to be your inheritance, as you spoke by Moses your
servant, when you brought our fathers out of Egypt, Lord GOD.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">54</span> It was so, that when Solomon had
finished praying all this prayer and supplication to the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, he arose from before the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s altar, from kneeling on his knees with
his hands spread out towards heaven. <span class="bibleverse">55</span>
He stood and blessed all the assembly of Israel with a loud voice,
saying, <span class="bibleverse">56</span> “Blessed be the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, who has given rest to his people Israel,
according to all that he promised. There has not failed one word of all
his good promise, which he promised by Moses his servant. <span
class="bibleverse">57</span> May the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>
our God be with us as he was with our fathers. Let him not leave us or
forsake us, <span class="bibleverse">58</span> that he may incline our
hearts to him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments,
his statutes, and his ordinances, which he commanded our fathers. <span
class="bibleverse">59</span> Let these my words, with which I have made
supplication before the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, be near to
the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> our God day and night, that he
may maintain the cause of his servant and the cause of his people
Israel, as every day requires; <span class="bibleverse">60</span> that
all the peoples of the earth may know that the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> himself is God. There is no one else.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">61</span> “Let your heart therefore be
perfect with the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> our God, to walk in
his statutes, and to keep his commandments, as it is today.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">62</span> The king, and all Israel with him,
offered sacrifice before the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. <span
class="bibleverse">63</span> Solomon offered for the sacrifice of peace
offerings, which he offered to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>,
twenty two thousand head of cattle and one hundred and twenty thousand
sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s house. <span
class="bibleverse">64</span> The same day the king made the middle of
the court holy that was before the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s
house; for there he offered the burnt offering, the meal offering, and
the fat of the peace offerings, because the bronze altar that was before
the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> was too little to receive the
burnt offering, the meal offering, and the fat of the peace
offerings.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">65</span> So Solomon held the feast at that
time, and all Israel with him, a great assembly, from the entrance of
Hamath to the brook of Egypt, before the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> our God, seven days and seven more days,
even fourteen days. <span class="bibleverse">66</span> On the eighth day
he sent the people away; and they blessed the king, and went to their
tents joyful and glad in their hearts for all the goodness that the
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> had shown to David his servant, and
to Israel his people.</p>
<h1 id="section-8">9</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> When Solomon had finished the
building of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s house, the king’s
house, and all Solomon’s desire which he was pleased to do, <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>
appeared to Solomon the second time, as he had appeared to him at
Gibeon. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> said to him, “I have heard your prayer and
your supplication that you have made before me. I have made this house
holy, which you have built, to put my name there forever; and my eyes
and my heart shall be there perpetually. <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> As for you, if you will walk before me as
David your father walked, in integrity of heart and in uprightness, to
do according to all that I have commanded you, and will keep my statutes
and my ordinances, <span class="bibleverse">5</span> then I will
establish the throne of your kingdom over Israel forever, as I promised
to David your father, saying, ‘There shall not fail from you a man on
the throne of Israel.’ <span class="bibleverse">6</span> But if you turn
away from following me, you or your children, and not keep my
commandments and my statutes which I have set before you, but go and
serve other gods and worship them, <span class="bibleverse">7</span>
then I will cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them; and
I will cast this house, which I have made holy for my name, out of my
sight; and Israel will be a proverb and a byword amongst all peoples.
<span class="bibleverse">8</span> Though this house is so high, yet
everyone who passes by it will be astonished and hiss; and they will
say, ‘Why has the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> done this to this
land and to this house?’ <span class="bibleverse">9</span> and they will
answer, ‘Because they abandoned the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>
their God, who brought their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and
embraced other gods, and worshipped them, and served them. Therefore the
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> has brought all this evil on
them.’”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">10</span> At the end of twenty years, in
which Solomon had built the two houses, the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s house and the king’s house <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> (now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished
Solomon with cedar trees and cypress trees, and with gold, according to
all his desire), King Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of
Galilee. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> Hiram came out of Tyre to
see the cities which Solomon had given him; and they didn’t please him.
<span class="bibleverse">13</span> He said, “What cities are these which
you have given me, my brother?” He called them the land of Cabul<a
href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> to this day. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> Hiram sent to the king one hundred and
twenty talents<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> of gold.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">15</span> This is the reason of the forced
labour which king Solomon conscripted: to build the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s house, his own house, Millo, Jerusalem’s
wall, Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer. <span class="bibleverse">16</span>
Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, taken Gezer, burnt it with fire,
killed the Canaanites who lived in the city, and given it for a wedding
gift to his daughter, Solomon’s wife. <span class="bibleverse">17</span>
Solomon built in the land Gezer, Beth Horon the lower, <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> Baalath, Tamar in the wilderness, <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> all the storage cities that Solomon had,
the cities for his chariots, the cities for his horsemen, and that which
Solomon desired to build for his pleasure in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon,
and in all the land of his dominion. <span class="bibleverse">20</span>
As for all the people who were left of the Amorites, the Hittites, the
Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not of the children
of Israel— <span class="bibleverse">21</span> their children who were
left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel were not able
utterly to destroy—of them Solomon raised a levy of bondservants to this
day. <span class="bibleverse">22</span> But of the children of Israel
Solomon made no bondservants; but they were the men of war, his
servants, his princes, his captains, and rulers of his chariots and of
his horsemen. <span class="bibleverse">23</span> These were the five
hundred and fifty chief officers who were over Solomon’s work, who ruled
over the people who laboured in the work.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">24</span> But Pharaoh’s daughter came up out
of David’s city to her house which Solomon had built for her. Then he
built Millo.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">25</span> Solomon offered burnt offerings
and peace offerings on the altar which he built to the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> three times per year, burning incense with
them on the altar that was before the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. So he finished the house.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">26</span> King Solomon made a fleet of ships
in Ezion Geber, which is beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red Sea, in
the land of Edom. <span class="bibleverse">27</span> Hiram sent in the
fleet his servants, sailors who had knowledge of the sea, with the
servants of Solomon. <span class="bibleverse">28</span> They came to
Ophir, and fetched from there gold, four hundred and twenty talents,<a
href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> and brought it to king Solomon.</p>
<h1 id="section-9">10</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> When the queen of Sheba heard of
the fame of Solomon concerning the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s
name, she came to test him with hard questions. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> She came to Jerusalem with a very great
caravan, with camels that bore spices, very much gold, and precious
stones; and when she had come to Solomon, she talked with him about all
that was in her heart. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> Solomon
answered all her questions. There wasn’t anything hidden from the king
which he didn’t tell her. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> When the
queen of Sheba had seen all the wisdom of Solomon, the house that he had
built, <span class="bibleverse">5</span> the food of his table, the
sitting of his servants, the attendance of his officials, their
clothing, his cup bearers, and his ascent by which he went up to the
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s house, there was no more spirit in
her. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> She said to the king, “It was a
true report that I heard in my own land of your acts and of your wisdom.
<span class="bibleverse">7</span> However, I didn’t believe the words
until I came and my eyes had seen it. Behold, not even half was told me!
Your wisdom and prosperity exceed the fame which I heard. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> Happy are your men, happy are these your
servants who stand continually before you, who hear your wisdom. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> Blessed is the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> your God, who delighted in you, to set you
on the throne of Israel. Because the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>
loved Israel forever, therefore he made you king, to do justice and
righteousness.” <span class="bibleverse">10</span> She gave the king one
hundred and twenty talents of gold, and a very great quantity of spices,
and precious stones. Never again was there such an abundance of spices
as these which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">11</span> The fleet of Hiram that brought
gold from Ophir also brought in from Ophir great quantities of almug
trees<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> and precious stones. <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> The king made of the almug trees pillars
for the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s house and for the king’s
house, harps also and stringed instruments for the singers; no such
almug trees came or were seen to this day.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">13</span> King Solomon gave to the queen of
Sheba all her desire, whatever she asked, in addition to that which
Solomon gave her of his royal bounty. So she turned and went to her own
land, she and her servants.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">14</span> Now the weight of gold that came
to Solomon in one year was six hundred and sixty-six talents<a
href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> of gold, <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> in addition to that which the traders
brought, and the traffic of the merchants, and of all the kings of the
mixed people, and of the governors of the country. <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> King Solomon made two hundred bucklers of
beaten gold; six hundred shekels<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> of gold went to one
buckler. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> He made three hundred
shields of beaten gold; three minas<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> of gold went to one
shield; and the king put them in the House of the Forest of Lebanon.
<span class="bibleverse">18</span> Moreover the king made a great throne
of ivory, and overlaid it with the finest gold. <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> There were six steps to the throne, and the
top of the throne was round behind; and there were armrests on either
side by the place of the seat, and two lions standing beside the
armrests. <span class="bibleverse">20</span> Twelve lions stood there on
the one side and on the other on the six steps. Nothing like it was made
in any kingdom. <span class="bibleverse">21</span> All king Solomon’s
drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the House of the
Forest of Lebanon were of pure gold. None were of silver, because it was
considered of little value in the days of Solomon. <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> For the king had a fleet of ships of
Tarshish at sea with Hiram’s fleet. Once every three years the fleet of
Tarshish came bringing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">23</span> So king Solomon exceeded all the
kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom. <span
class="bibleverse">24</span> All the earth sought the presence of
Solomon to hear his wisdom which God had put in his heart. <span
class="bibleverse">25</span> Year after year, every man brought his
tribute, vessels of silver, vessels of gold, clothing, armour, spices,
horses, and mules.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">26</span> Solomon gathered together chariots
and horsemen. He had one thousand and four hundred chariots and twelve
thousand horsemen. He kept them in the chariot cities and with the king
at Jerusalem. <span class="bibleverse">27</span> The king made silver as
common as stones in Jerusalem, and cedars as common as the sycamore
trees that are in the lowland. <span class="bibleverse">28</span> The
horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt. The king’s merchants
received them in droves, each drove at a price. <span
class="bibleverse">29</span> A chariot was imported from Egypt for six
hundred shekels<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> of silver, and a horse for one
hundred and fifty shekels; and so they exported them to all the kings of
the Hittites and to the kings of Syria.</p>
<h1 id="section-10">11</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Now king Solomon loved many foreign
women, together with the daughter of Pharaoh: women of the Moabites,
Ammonites, Edomites, Sidonians, and Hittites, <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> of the nations concerning which the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> said to the children of Israel, “You shall
not go amongst them, neither shall they come amongst you, for surely
they will turn away your heart after their gods.” Solomon joined to
these in love. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> He had seven hundred
wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines. His wives turned his
heart away. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> When Solomon was old, his
wives turned away his heart after other gods; and his heart was not
perfect with the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> his God, as the
heart of David his father was. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> For
Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, and after
Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> Solomon did that which was evil in the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s sight, and didn’t go fully after the
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, as David his father did. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> Then Solomon built a high place for Chemosh
the abomination of Moab, on the mountain that is before Jerusalem, and
for Molech the abomination of the children of Ammon. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> So he did for all his foreign wives, who
burnt incense and sacrificed to their gods. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> was
angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned away from the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, who had appeared to
him twice, <span class="bibleverse">10</span> and had commanded him
concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods; but he
didn’t keep that which the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>
commanded. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> Therefore the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> said to Solomon, “Because this is done by
you, and you have not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I have
commanded you, I will surely tear the kingdom from you, and will give it
to your servant. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> Nevertheless, I will
not do it in your days, for David your father’s sake; but I will tear it
out of your son’s hand. <span class="bibleverse">13</span> However, I
will not tear away all the kingdom; but I will give one tribe to your
son, for David my servant’s sake, and for Jerusalem’s sake which I have
chosen.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">14</span> The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> raised up an adversary to Solomon: Hadad
the Edomite. He was one of the king’s offspring in Edom. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> For when David was in Edom, and Joab the
captain of the army had gone up to bury the slain, and had struck every
male in Edom <span class="bibleverse">16</span> (for Joab and all Israel
remained there six months, until he had cut off every male in Edom),
<span class="bibleverse">17</span> Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites
of his father’s servants with him, to go into Egypt, when Hadad was
still a little child. <span class="bibleverse">18</span> They arose out
of Midian and came to Paran; and they took men with them out of Paran,
and they came to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave him a house,
and appointed him food, and gave him land. <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> Hadad found great favour in the sight of
Pharaoh, so that he gave him as wife the sister of his own wife, the
sister of Tahpenes the queen. <span class="bibleverse">20</span> The
sister of Tahpenes bore him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in
Pharaoh’s house; and Genubath was in Pharaoh’s house amongst the sons of
Pharaoh. <span class="bibleverse">21</span> When Hadad heard in Egypt
that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the army
was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, “Let me depart, that I may go to my own
country.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">22</span> Then Pharaoh said to him, “But
what have you lacked with me, that behold, you seek to go to your own
country?”</p>
<p>He answered, “Nothing, however only let me depart.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">23</span> God raised up an adversary to him,
Rezon the son of Eliada, who had fled from his lord, Hadadezer king of
Zobah. <span class="bibleverse">24</span> He gathered men to himself,
and became captain over a troop, when David killed them of Zobah. They
went to Damascus and lived there, and reigned in Damascus. <span
class="bibleverse">25</span> He was an adversary to Israel all the days
of Solomon, in addition to the mischief of Hadad. He abhorred Israel,
and reigned over Syria.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">26</span> Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an
Ephraimite of Zeredah, a servant of Solomon, whose mother’s name was
Zeruah, a widow, also lifted up his hand against the king. <span
class="bibleverse">27</span> This was the reason why he lifted up his
hand against the king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breach of
his father David’s city. <span class="bibleverse">28</span> The man
Jeroboam was a mighty man of valour; and Solomon saw the young man that
he was industrious, and he put him in charge of all the labour of the
house of Joseph. <span class="bibleverse">29</span> At that time, when
Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found
him on the way. Now Ahijah had clad himself with a new garment; and the
two of them were alone in the field. <span class="bibleverse">30</span>
Ahijah took the new garment that was on him, and tore it in twelve
pieces. <span class="bibleverse">31</span> He said to Jeroboam, “Take
ten pieces; for the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the God of
Israel, says, ‘Behold, I will tear the kingdom out of the hand of
Solomon and will give ten tribes to you <span
class="bibleverse">32</span> (but he shall have one tribe, for my
servant David’s sake and for Jerusalem’s sake, the city which I have
chosen out of all the tribes of Israel), <span
class="bibleverse">33</span> because they have forsaken me, and have
worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the god of
Moab, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon. They have not walked
in my ways, to do that which is right in my eyes, and to keep my
statutes and my ordinances, as David his father did.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">34</span> “‘However, I will not take the
whole kingdom out of his hand, but I will make him prince all the days
of his life for David my servant’s sake whom I chose, who kept my
commandments and my statutes, <span class="bibleverse">35</span> but I
will take the kingdom out of his son’s hand and will give it to you,
even ten tribes. <span class="bibleverse">36</span> I will give one
tribe to his son, that David my servant may have a lamp always before me
in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen for myself to put my name
there. <span class="bibleverse">37</span> I will take you, and you shall
reign according to all that your soul desires, and shall be king over
Israel. <span class="bibleverse">38</span> It shall be, if you will
listen to all that I command you, and will walk in my ways, and do that
which is right in my eyes, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as
David my servant did, that I will be with you, and will build you a sure
house, as I built for David, and will give Israel to you. <span
class="bibleverse">39</span> I will afflict the offspring of David for
this, but not forever.’”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">40</span> Therefore Solomon sought to kill
Jeroboam, but Jeroboam arose and fled into Egypt, to Shishak king of
Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">41</span> Now the rest of the acts of
Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, aren’t they written in the
book of the acts of Solomon? <span class="bibleverse">42</span> The time
that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years. <span
class="bibleverse">43</span> Solomon slept with his fathers, and was
buried in his father David’s city; and Rehoboam his son reigned in his
place.</p>
<h1 id="section-11">12</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all
Israel had come to Shechem to make him king. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> When Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it
(for he was yet in Egypt, where he had fled from the presence of king
Solomon, and Jeroboam lived in Egypt; <span class="bibleverse">3</span>
and they sent and called him), Jeroboam and all the assembly of Israel
came, and spoke to Rehoboam, saying, <span class="bibleverse">4</span>
“Your father made our yoke difficult. Now therefore make the hard
service of your father, and his heavy yoke which he put on us, lighter,
and we will serve you.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">5</span> He said to them, “Depart for three
days, then come back to me.”</p>
<p>So the people departed.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">6</span> King Rehoboam took counsel with the
old men who had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived,
saying, “What counsel do you give me to answer these people?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">7</span> They replied, “If you will be a
servant to this people today, and will serve them, and answer them with
good words, then they will be your servants forever.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">8</span> But he abandoned the counsel of the
old men which they had given him, and took counsel with the young men
who had grown up with him, who stood before him. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> He said to them, “What counsel do you give,
that we may answer these people who have spoken to me, saying, ‘Make the
yoke that your father put on us lighter?’”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">10</span> The young men who had grown up
with him said to him, “Tell these people who spoke to you, saying, ‘Your
father made our yoke heavy, but make it lighter to us’— tell them, ‘My
little finger is thicker than my father’s waist. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> Now my father burdened you with a heavy
yoke, but I will add to your yoke. My father chastised you with whips,
but I will chastise you with scorpions.’”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">12</span> So Jeroboam and all the people
came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king asked, saying, “Come to me
again the third day.” <span class="bibleverse">13</span> The king
answered the people roughly, and abandoned the counsel of the old men
which they had given him, <span class="bibleverse">14</span> and spoke
to them according to the counsel of the young men, saying, “My father
made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke. My father chastised
you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">15</span> So the king didn’t listen to the
people; for it was a thing brought about from the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, that he might establish his word, which
the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to
Jeroboam the son of Nebat. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> When all
Israel saw that the king didn’t listen to them, the people answered the
king, saying, “What portion have we in David? We don’t have an
inheritance in the son of Jesse. To your tents, Israel! Now see to your
own house, David.” So Israel departed to their tents.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">17</span> But as for the children of Israel
who lived in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them. <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was
over the men subject to forced labour; and all Israel stoned him to
death with stones. King Rehoboam hurried to get himself up to his
chariot, to flee to Jerusalem. <span class="bibleverse">19</span> So
Israel rebelled against David’s house to this day.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">20</span> When all Israel heard that
Jeroboam had returned, they sent and called him to the congregation, and
made him king over all Israel. There was no one who followed David’s
house, except for the tribe of Judah only.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">21</span> When Rehoboam had come to
Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah and the tribe of
Benjamin, a hundred and eighty thousand chosen men who were warriors, to
fight against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to
Rehoboam the son of Solomon. <span class="bibleverse">22</span> But the
word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying, <span
class="bibleverse">23</span> “Speak to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king
of Judah, and to all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the rest of
the people, saying, <span class="bibleverse">24</span> ‘The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> says, “You shall not go up or fight
against your brothers, the children of Israel. Everyone return to his
house; for this thing is from me.”’” So they listened to the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s word, and returned and went their way,
according to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s word.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">25</span> Then Jeroboam built Shechem in the
hill country of Ephraim, and lived in it; and he went out from there and
built Penuel. <span class="bibleverse">26</span> Jeroboam said in his
heart, “Now the kingdom will return to David’s house. <span
class="bibleverse">27</span> If this people goes up to offer sacrifices
in the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s house at Jerusalem, then
the heart of this people will turn again to their lord, even to Rehoboam
king of Judah; and they will kill me, and return to Rehoboam king of
Judah.” <span class="bibleverse">28</span> So the king took counsel, and
made two calves of gold; and he said to them, “It is too much for you to
go up to Jerusalem. Look and behold your gods, Israel, which brought you
up out of the land of Egypt!” <span class="bibleverse">29</span> He set
the one in Bethel, and the other he put in Dan. <span
class="bibleverse">30</span> This thing became a sin, for the people
went even as far as Dan to worship before the one there. <span
class="bibleverse">31</span> He made houses of high places, and made
priests from amongst all the people, who were not of the sons of Levi.
<span class="bibleverse">32</span> Jeroboam ordained a feast in the
eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like the feast that is
in Judah, and he went up to the altar. He did so in Bethel, sacrificing
to the calves that he had made, and he placed in Bethel the priests of
the high places that he had made. <span class="bibleverse">33</span> He
went up to the altar which he had made in Bethel on the fifteenth day in
the eighth month, even in the month which he had devised of his own
heart; and he ordained a feast for the children of Israel, and went up
to the altar to burn incense.</p>
<h1 id="section-12">13</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Behold, a man of God came out of
Judah by the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s word to Bethel; and
Jeroboam was standing by the altar to burn incense. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> He cried against the altar by the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s word, and said, “Altar! Altar! the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> says: ‘Behold, a son will be born to
David’s house, Josiah by name. On you he will sacrifice the priests of
the high places who burn incense on you, and they will burn men’s bones
on you.’” <span class="bibleverse">3</span> He gave a sign the same day,
saying, “This is the sign which the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>
has spoken: Behold, the altar will be split apart, and the ashes that
are on it will be poured out.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">4</span> When the king heard the saying of
the man of God, which he cried against the altar in Bethel, Jeroboam put
out his hand from the altar, saying, “Seize him!” His hand, which he put
out against him, dried up, so that he could not draw it back again to
himself. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> The altar was also split
apart, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign
which the man of God had given by the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s word. <span class="bibleverse">6</span>
The king answered the man of God, “Now intercede for the favour of the
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> your God, and pray for me, that my
hand may be restored me again.”</p>
<p>The man of God interceded with the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and the king’s hand was restored to him
again, and became as it was before.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">7</span> The king said to the man of God,
“Come home with me and refresh yourself, and I will give you a
reward.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">8</span> The man of God said to the king,
“Even if you gave me half of your house, I would not go in with you,
neither would I eat bread nor drink water in this place; <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> for so was it commanded me by the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s word, saying, ‘You shall eat no bread,
drink no water, and don’t return by the way that you came.’” <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> So he went another way, and didn’t return
by the way that he came to Bethel.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">11</span> Now an old prophet lived in
Bethel, and one of his sons came and told him all the works that the man
of God had done that day in Bethel. They also told their father the
words which he had spoken to the king.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">12</span> Their father said to them, “Which
way did he go?” Now his sons had seen which way the man of God went, who
came from Judah. <span class="bibleverse">13</span> He said to his sons,
“Saddle the donkey for me.” So they saddled the donkey for him; and he
rode on it. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> He went after the man of
God, and found him sitting under an oak. He said to him, “Are you the
man of God who came from Judah?”</p>
<p>He said, “I am.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">15</span> Then he said to him, “Come home
with me and eat bread.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">16</span> He said, “I may not return with
you, nor go in with you. I will not eat bread or drink water with you in
this place. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> For it was said to me by
the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s word, ‘You shall eat no bread
or drink water there, and don’t turn again to go by the way that you
came.’”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">18</span> He said to him, “I also am a
prophet as you are; and an angel spoke to me by the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s word, saying, ‘Bring him back with you
into your house, that he may eat bread and drink water.’” He lied to
him.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">19</span> So he went back with him, ate
bread in his house, and drank water. <span class="bibleverse">20</span>
As they sat at the table, the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s word
came to the prophet who brought him back; <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> and he cried out to the man of God who came
from Judah, saying, “The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> says,
‘Because you have been disobedient to the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s word, and have not kept the commandment
which the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> your God commanded you,
<span class="bibleverse">22</span> but came back, and have eaten bread
and drank water in the place of which he said to you, “Eat no bread, and
drink no water,” your body will not come to the tomb of your
fathers.’”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">23</span> After he had eaten bread and after
he drank, he saddled the donkey for the prophet whom he had brought
back. <span class="bibleverse">24</span> When he had gone, a lion met
him by the way and killed him. His body was thrown on the path, and the
donkey stood by it. The lion also stood by the body. <span
class="bibleverse">25</span> Behold, men passed by and saw the body
thrown on the path, and the lion standing by the body; and they came and
told it in the city where the old prophet lived. <span
class="bibleverse">26</span> When the prophet who brought him back from
the way heard of it, he said, “It is the man of God who was disobedient
to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s word. Therefore the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> has delivered him to the lion, which has
mauled him and slain him, according to the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s word which he spoke to him.” <span
class="bibleverse">27</span> He said to his sons, saying, “Saddle the
donkey for me,” and they saddled it. <span class="bibleverse">28</span>
He went and found his body thrown on the path, and the donkey and the
lion standing by the body. The lion had not eaten the body nor mauled
the donkey. <span class="bibleverse">29</span> The prophet took up the
body of the man of God, and laid it on the donkey, and brought it back.
He came to the city of the old prophet to mourn, and to bury him. <span
class="bibleverse">30</span> He laid his body in his own grave; and they
mourned over him, saying, “Alas, my brother!”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">31</span> After he had buried him, he spoke
to his sons, saying, “When I am dead, bury me in the tomb in which the
man of God is buried. Lay my bones beside his bones. <span
class="bibleverse">32</span> For the saying which he cried by the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s word against the altar in Bethel, and
against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of
Samaria, will surely happen.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">33</span> After this thing, Jeroboam didn’t
turn from his evil way, but again made priests of the high places from
amongst all the people. Whoever wanted to, he consecrated him, that
there might be priests of the high places. <span
class="bibleverse">34</span> This thing became sin to the house of
Jeroboam, even to cut it off and to destroy it from off the surface of
the earth.</p>
<h1 id="section-13">14</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> At that time Abijah the son of
Jeroboam became sick. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> Jeroboam said to
his wife, “Please get up and disguise yourself, so that you won’t be
recognised as Jeroboam’s wife. Go to Shiloh. Behold, Ahijah the prophet
is there, who said that I would be king over this people. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> Take with you ten loaves of bread, some
cakes, and a jar of honey, and go to him. He will tell you what will
become of the child.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">4</span> Jeroboam’s wife did so, and arose
and went to Shiloh, and came to Ahijah’s house. Now Ahijah could not
see, for his eyes were set by reason of his age. <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> said
to Ahijah, “Behold, Jeroboam’s wife is coming to enquire of you
concerning her son, for he is sick. Tell her such and such; for it will
be, when she comes in, that she will pretend to be another woman.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">6</span> So when Ahijah heard the sound of
her feet as she came in at the door, he said, “Come in, Jeroboam’s wife!
Why do you pretend to be another? For I am sent to you with heavy news.
<span class="bibleverse">7</span> Go, tell Jeroboam, ‘The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, says: “Because I
exalted you from amongst the people, and made you prince over my people
Israel, <span class="bibleverse">8</span> and tore the kingdom away from
David’s house, and gave it you; and yet you have not been as my servant
David, who kept my commandments, and who followed me with all his heart,
to do that only which was right in my eyes, <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> but have done evil above all who were before
you, and have gone and made for yourself other gods, molten images, to
provoke me to anger, and have cast me behind your back, <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> therefore, behold, I will bring evil on the
house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam everyone who urinates
on a wall,<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> he who is shut up and he who is
left at large in Israel, and will utterly sweep away the house of
Jeroboam, as a man sweeps away dung until it is all gone. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> The dogs will eat he who belongs to
Jeroboam who dies in the city; and the birds of the sky will eat he who
dies in the field, for the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> has
spoken it.”’ <span class="bibleverse">12</span> Arise therefore, and go
to your house. When your feet enter into the city, the child will die.
<span class="bibleverse">13</span> All Israel will mourn for him and
bury him; for he only of Jeroboam will come to the grave, because in him
there is found some good thing towards the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, in the house of
Jeroboam. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> Moreover the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> will raise up a king for himself over
Israel who will cut off the house of Jeroboam. This is the day! What?
Even now. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> For the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> will strike Israel, as a reed is shaken in
the water; and he will root up Israel out of this good land which he
gave to their fathers, and will scatter them beyond the River,<a
href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> because they have made their
Asherah poles, provoking the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> to
anger. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> He will give Israel up because
of the sins of Jeroboam, which he has sinned, and with which he has made
Israel to sin.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">17</span> Jeroboam’s wife arose and
departed, and came to Tirzah. As she came to the threshold of the house,
the child died. <span class="bibleverse">18</span> All Israel buried him
and mourned for him, according to the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s word, which he spoke by his servant
Ahijah the prophet.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">19</span> The rest of the acts of Jeroboam,
how he fought and how he reigned, behold, they are written in the book
of the chronicles of the kings of Israel. <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> The days which Jeroboam reigned were twenty
two years; then he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in
his place.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">21</span> Rehoboam the son of Solomon
reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he began to
reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> had chosen out of all the tribes of
Israel, to put his name there. His mother’s name was Naamah the
Ammonitess. <span class="bibleverse">22</span> Judah did that which was
evil in the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s sight, and they
provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they committed, above all
that their fathers had done. <span class="bibleverse">23</span> For they
also built for themselves high places, sacred pillars, and Asherah poles
on every high hill and under every green tree. <span
class="bibleverse">24</span> There were also sodomites in the land. They
did according to all the abominations of the nations which the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> drove out before the children of
Israel.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">25</span> In the fifth year of king
Rehoboam, Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem; <span
class="bibleverse">26</span> and he took away the treasures of the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s house and the treasures of the king’s
house. He even took away all of it, including all the gold shields which
Solomon had made. <span class="bibleverse">27</span> King Rehoboam made
shields of bronze in their place, and committed them to the hands of the
captains of the guard, who kept the door of the king’s house. <span
class="bibleverse">28</span> It was so, that as often as the king went
into the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s house, the guard bore
them, and brought them back into the guard room.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">29</span> Now the rest of the acts of
Rehoboam, and all that he did, aren’t they written in the book of the
chronicles of the kings of Judah? <span class="bibleverse">30</span>
There was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually. <span
class="bibleverse">31</span> Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was
buried with his fathers in David’s city. His mother’s name was Naamah
the Ammonitess. Abijam his son reigned in his place.</p>
<h1 id="section-14">15</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Now in the eighteenth year of king
Jeroboam the son of Nebat, Abijam began to reign over Judah. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His
mother’s name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> He walked in all the sins of his father,
which he had done before him; and his heart was not perfect with the
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> his God, as the heart of David his
father. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> Nevertheless for David’s sake,
the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> his God gave him a lamp in
Jerusalem, to set up his son after him and to establish Jerusalem; <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> because David did that which was right in
the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s eyes, and didn’t turn away
from anything that he commanded him all the days of his life, except
only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> Now there was war between Rehoboam and
Jeroboam all the days of his life. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> The
rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, aren’t they written in
the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? There was war between
Abijam and Jeroboam. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> Abijam slept with
his fathers, and they buried him in David’s city; and Asa his son
reigned in his place.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">9</span> In the twentieth year of Jeroboam
king of Israel, Asa began to reign over Judah. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> He reigned forty-one years in Jerusalem.
His mother’s name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> Asa did that which was right in the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s eyes, as David his father did. <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> He put away the sodomites out of the land,
and removed all the idols that his fathers had made. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> He also removed Maacah his mother from
being queen, because she had made an abominable image for an Asherah.
Asa cut down her image and burnt it at the brook Kidron. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> But the high places were not taken away.
Nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect with the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> all his days. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> He brought into the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s house the things that his father had
dedicated, and the things that he himself had dedicated: silver, gold,
and utensils.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">16</span> There was war between Asa and
Baasha king of Israel all their days. <span class="bibleverse">17</span>
Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he
might not allow anyone to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah. <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> Then Asa took all the silver and the gold
that was left in the treasures of the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s house, and the treasures of the king’s
house, and delivered it into the hand of his servants. Then King Asa
sent them to Ben Hadad, the son of Tabrimmon, the son of Hezion, king of
Syria, who lived at Damascus, saying, <span class="bibleverse">19</span>
“Let there be a treaty between me and you, like that between my father
and your father. Behold, I have sent to you a present of silver and
gold. Go, break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel, that he may
depart from me.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">20</span> Ben Hadad listened to king Asa,
and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel, and
struck Ijon, and Dan, and Abel Beth Maacah, and all Chinneroth, with all
the land of Naphtali. <span class="bibleverse">21</span> When Baasha
heard of it, he stopped building Ramah, and lived in Tirzah. <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> Then king Asa made a proclamation to all
Judah. No one was exempted. They carried away the stones of Ramah, and
its timber, with which Baasha had built; and king Asa used it to build
Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah. <span class="bibleverse">23</span> Now the
rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that he did, and
the cities which he built, aren’t they written in the book of the
chronicles of the kings of Judah? But in the time of his old age he was
diseased in his feet. <span class="bibleverse">24</span> Asa slept with
his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in his father David’s city;
and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his place.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">25</span> Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to
reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah; and he
reigned over Israel two years. <span class="bibleverse">26</span> He did
that which was evil in the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s sight,
and walked in the way of his father, and in his sin with which he made
Israel to sin. <span class="bibleverse">27</span> Baasha the son of
Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against him; and Baasha
struck him at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines; for Nadab
and all Israel were besieging Gibbethon. <span
class="bibleverse">28</span> Even in the third year of Asa king of
Judah, Baasha killed him and reigned in his place. <span
class="bibleverse">29</span> As soon as he was king, he struck all the
house of Jeroboam. He didn’t leave to Jeroboam any who breathed, until
he had destroyed him, according to the saying of the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, which he spoke by his servant Ahijah the
Shilonite; <span class="bibleverse">30</span> for the sins of Jeroboam
which he sinned, and with which he made Israel to sin, because of his
provocation with which he provoked the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, to anger.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">31</span> Now the rest of the acts of Nadab,
and all that he did, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles
of the kings of Israel? <span class="bibleverse">32</span> There was war
between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">33</span> In the third year of Asa king of
Judah, Baasha the son of Ahijah began to reign over all Israel in Tirzah
for twenty-four years. <span class="bibleverse">34</span> He did that
which was evil in the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s sight, and
walked in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin with which he made Israel
to sin.</p>
<h1 id="section-15">16</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s word came to Jehu the son of Hanani
against Baasha, saying, <span class="bibleverse">2</span> “Because I
exalted you out of the dust and made you prince over my people Israel,
and you have walked in the way of Jeroboam and have made my people
Israel to sin, to provoke me to anger with their sins, <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> behold, I will utterly sweep away Baasha and
his house; and I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son
of Nebat. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> The dogs will eat Baasha’s
descendants who die in the city; and he who dies of his in the field,
the birds of the sky will eat.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">5</span> Now the rest of the acts of Baasha,
and what he did, and his might, aren’t they written in the book of the
chronicles of the kings of Israel? <span class="bibleverse">6</span>
Baasha slept with his fathers, and was buried in Tirzah; and Elah his
son reigned in his place.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">7</span> Moreover the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s word came by the prophet Jehu the son of
Hanani against Baasha and against his house, both because of all the
evil that he did in the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s sight, to
provoke him to anger with the work of his hands, in being like the house
of Jeroboam, and because he struck him.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">8</span> In the twenty-sixth year of Asa
king of Judah, Elah the son of Baasha began to reign over Israel in
Tirzah for two years. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> His servant
Zimri, captain of half his chariots, conspired against him. Now he was
in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza, who was over the
household in Tirzah; <span class="bibleverse">10</span> and Zimri went
in and struck him and killed him in the twenty-seventh year of Asa king
of Judah, and reigned in his place.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">11</span> When he began to reign, as soon as
he sat on his throne, he attacked all the house of Baasha. He didn’t
leave him a single one who urinates on a wall<a href="#fn25"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a>
amongst his relatives or his friends. <span class="bibleverse">12</span>
Thus Zimri destroyed all the house of Baasha, according to the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s word which he spoke against Baasha by
Jehu the prophet, <span class="bibleverse">13</span> for all the sins of
Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, which they sinned and with which
they made Israel to sin, to provoke the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, to anger with their
vanities. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> Now the rest of the acts of
Elah, and all that he did, aren’t they written in the book of the
chronicles of the kings of Israel?</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">15</span> In the twenty-seventh year of Asa
king of Judah, Zimri reigned seven days in Tirzah. Now the people were
encamped against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines. <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> The people who were encamped heard that
Zimri had conspired, and had also killed the king. Therefore all Israel
made Omri, the captain of the army, king over Israel that day in the
camp. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> Omri went up from Gibbethon,
and all Israel with him, and they besieged Tirzah. <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> When Zimri saw that the city was taken, he
went into the fortified part of the king’s house and burnt the king’s
house over him with fire, and died, <span class="bibleverse">19</span>
for his sins which he sinned in doing that which was evil in the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s sight, in walking in the way of
Jeroboam, and in his sin which he did to make Israel to sin. <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his
treason that he committed, aren’t they written in the book of the
chronicles of the kings of Israel?</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">21</span> Then the people of Israel were
divided into two parts: half of the people followed Tibni the son of
Ginath, to make him king, and half followed Omri. <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> But the people who followed Omri prevailed
against the people who followed Tibni the son of Ginath; so Tibni died,
and Omri reigned. <span class="bibleverse">23</span> In the thirty-first
year of Asa king of Judah, Omri began to reign over Israel for twelve
years. He reigned six years in Tirzah. <span
class="bibleverse">24</span> He bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for
two talents<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> of silver; and he built on the
hill, and called the name of the city which he built, Samaria, after the
name of Shemer, the owner of the hill. <span
class="bibleverse">25</span> Omri did that which was evil in the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s sight, and dealt wickedly above all who
were before him. <span class="bibleverse">26</span> For he walked in all
the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in his sins with which he made
Israel to sin, to provoke the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the
God of Israel, to anger with their vanities. <span
class="bibleverse">27</span> Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he
did, and his might that he showed, aren’t they written in the book of
the chronicles of the kings of Israel? <span
class="bibleverse">28</span> So Omri slept with his fathers, and was
buried in Samaria; and Ahab his son reigned in his place.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">29</span> In the thirty-eighth year of Asa
king of Judah, Ahab the son of Omri began to reign over Israel. Ahab the
son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty-two years. <span
class="bibleverse">30</span> Ahab the son of Omri did that which was
evil in the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s sight above all that
were before him. <span class="bibleverse">31</span> As if it had been a
light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, he
took as wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Sidonians, and
went and served Baal and worshipped him. <span
class="bibleverse">32</span> He raised up an altar for Baal in the house
of Baal, which he had built in Samaria. <span
class="bibleverse">33</span> Ahab made the Asherah; and Ahab did more
yet to provoke the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the God of
Israel, to anger than all the kings of Israel who were before him. <span
class="bibleverse">34</span> In his days Hiel the Bethelite built
Jericho. He laid its foundation with the loss of Abiram his firstborn,
and set up its gates with the loss of his youngest son Segub, according
to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s word, which he spoke by
Joshua the son of Nun.</p>
<h1 id="section-16">17</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Elijah the Tishbite, who was one of
the settlers of Gilead, said to Ahab, “As the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, lives, before whom I
stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my
word.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">2</span> Then the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s word came to him, saying, <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> “Go away from here, turn eastward, and hide
yourself by the brook Cherith, that is before the Jordan. <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> You shall drink from the brook. I have
commanded the ravens to feed you there.” <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> So he went and did according to the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s word, for he went and lived by the brook
Cherith that is before the Jordan. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> The
ravens brought him bread and meat in the morning, and bread and meat in
the evening; and he drank from the brook. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> After a while, the brook dried up, because
there was no rain in the land.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">8</span> The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s word came to him, saying, <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> “Arise, go to Zarephath, which belongs to
Sidon, and stay there. Behold, I have commanded a widow there to sustain
you.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">10</span> So he arose and went to Zarephath;
and when he came to the gate of the city, behold, a widow was there
gathering sticks. He called to her and said, “Please get me a little
water in a jar, that I may drink.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">11</span> As she was going to get it, he
called to her and said, “Please bring me a morsel of bread in your
hand.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">12</span> She said, “As the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> your God lives, I don’t have anything
baked, but only a handful of meal in a jar and a little oil in a jar.
Behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and bake it for me
and my son, that we may eat it, and die.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">13</span> Elijah said to her, “Don’t be
afraid. Go and do as you have said; but make me a little cake from it
first, and bring it out to me, and afterward make some for you and for
your son. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> For the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, says, ‘The jar of meal
will not run out, and the jar of oil will not fail, until the day that
the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> sends rain on the earth.’”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">15</span> She went and did according to the
saying of Elijah; and she, he, and her household ate many days. <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> The jar of meal didn’t run out and the jar
of oil didn’t fail, according to the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s word, which he spoke by Elijah.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">17</span> After these things, the son of the
woman, the mistress of the house, became sick; and his sickness was so
severe that there was no breath left in him. <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> She said to Elijah, “What have I to do with
you, you man of God? You have come to me to bring my sin to memory, and
to kill my son!”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">19</span> He said to her, “Give me your
son.” He took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into the room
where he stayed, and laid him on his own bed. <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> He cried to the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> and said, “<span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> my God, have you also brought evil on the
widow with whom I am staying, by killing her son?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">21</span> He stretched himself on the child
three times, and cried to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> and
said, “<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> my God, please let this
child’s soul come into him again.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">22</span> The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> listened to the voice of Elijah; and the
soul of the child came into him again, and he revived. <span
class="bibleverse">23</span> Elijah took the child and brought him down
out of the room into the house, and delivered him to his mother; and
Elijah said, “Behold, your son lives.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">24</span> The woman said to Elijah, “Now I
know that you are a man of God, and that the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s word in your mouth is truth.”</p>
<h1 id="section-17">18</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> After many days, the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s word came to Elijah, in the third year,
saying, “Go, show yourself to Ahab; and I will send rain on the
earth.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">2</span> Elijah went to show himself to
Ahab. The famine was severe in Samaria. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> Ahab called Obadiah, who was over the
household. (Now Obadiah feared the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>
greatly; <span class="bibleverse">4</span> for when Jezebel cut off the
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s prophets, Obadiah took one hundred
prophets, and hid them fifty to a cave, and fed them with bread and
water.) <span class="bibleverse">5</span> Ahab said to Obadiah, “Go
through the land, to all the springs of water, and to all the brooks.
Perhaps we may find grass and save the horses and mules alive, that we
not lose all the animals.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">6</span> So they divided the land between
them to pass throughout it. Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah
went another way by himself. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> As
Obadiah was on the way, behold, Elijah met him. He recognised him, and
fell on his face, and said, “Is it you, my lord Elijah?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">8</span> He answered him, “It is I. Go, tell
your lord, ‘Behold, Elijah is here!’”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">9</span> He said, “How have I sinned, that
you would deliver your servant into the hand of Ahab, to kill me? <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> As the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>
your God lives, there is no nation or kingdom where my lord has not sent
to seek you. When they said, ‘He is not here,’ he took an oath of the
kingdom and nation that they didn’t find you. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> Now you say, ‘Go, tell your lord, “Behold,
Elijah is here.”’ <span class="bibleverse">12</span> It will happen, as
soon as I leave you, that the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s
Spirit will carry you I don’t know where; and so when I come and tell
Ahab, and he can’t find you, he will kill me. But I, your servant, have
feared the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> from my youth. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> Wasn’t it told my lord what I did when
Jezebel killed the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s prophets, how I
hid one hundred men of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s
prophets with fifty to a cave, and fed them with bread and water? <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> Now you say, ‘Go, tell your lord, “Behold,
Elijah is here”.’ He will kill me.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">15</span> Elijah said, “As the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> of Armies lives, before whom I stand, I
will surely show myself to him today.” <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him;
and Ahab went to meet Elijah.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">17</span> When Ahab saw Elijah, Ahab said to
him, “Is that you, you troubler of Israel?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">18</span> He answered, “I have not troubled
Israel, but you and your father’s house, in that you have forsaken the
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s commandments and you have followed
the Baals. <span class="bibleverse">19</span> Now therefore send, and
gather to me all Israel to Mount Carmel, and four hundred and fifty of
the prophets of Baal, and four hundred of the prophets of the Asherah,
who eat at Jezebel’s table.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">20</span> So Ahab sent to all the children
of Israel, and gathered the prophets together to Mount Carmel. <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> Elijah came near to all the people, and
said, “How long will you waver between the two sides? If the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is God, follow him; but if Baal, then
follow him.”</p>
<p>The people didn’t say a word.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">22</span> Then Elijah said to the people,
“I, even I only, am left as a prophet of the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>; but Baal’s prophets are four hundred and
fifty men. <span class="bibleverse">23</span> Let them therefore give us
two bulls; and let them choose one bull for themselves, and cut it in
pieces, and lay it on the wood, and put no fire under; and I will dress
the other bull, and lay it on the wood, and put no fire under it. <span
class="bibleverse">24</span> You call on the name of your god, and I
will call on the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s name. The God who
answers by fire, let him be God.”</p>
<p>All the people answered, “What you say is good.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">25</span> Elijah said to the prophets of
Baal, “Choose one bull for yourselves, and dress it first, for you are
many; and call on the name of your god, but put no fire under it.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">26</span> They took the bull which was given
them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning
even until noon, saying, “Baal, hear us!” But there was no voice, and
nobody answered. They leapt about the altar which was made.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">27</span> At noon, Elijah mocked them, and
said, “Cry aloud, for he is a god. Either he is deep in thought, or he
has gone somewhere, or he is on a journey, or perhaps he sleeps and must
be awakened.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">28</span> They cried aloud, and cut
themselves in their way with knives and lances until the blood gushed
out on them. <span class="bibleverse">29</span> When midday was past,
they prophesied until the time of the evening offering; but there was no
voice, no answer, and nobody paid attention.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">30</span> Elijah said to all the people,
“Come near to me!”; and all the people came near to him. He repaired the
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s altar that had been thrown down.
<span class="bibleverse">31</span> Elijah took twelve stones, according
to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s word came, saying, “Israel shall be your
name.” <span class="bibleverse">32</span> With the stones he built an
altar in the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s name. He made a
trench around the altar large enough to contain two seahs<a href="#fn27"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a>
of seed. <span class="bibleverse">33</span> He put the wood in order,
and cut the bull in pieces and laid it on the wood. He said, “Fill four
jars with water, and pour it on the burnt offering and on the wood.”
<span class="bibleverse">34</span> He said, “Do it a second time;” and
they did it the second time. He said, “Do it a third time;” and they did
it the third time. <span class="bibleverse">35</span> The water ran
around the altar; and he also filled the trench with water.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">36</span> At the time of the evening
offering, Elijah the prophet came near and said, “<span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of
Israel, let it be known today that you are God in Israel and that I am
your servant, and that I have done all these things at your word. <span
class="bibleverse">37</span> Hear me, <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, hear me, that this people may know that
you, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, are God, and that you have
turned their heart back again.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">38</span> Then the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s fire fell and consumed the burnt
offering, the wood, the stones, and the dust; and it licked up the water
that was in the trench. <span class="bibleverse">39</span> When all the
people saw it, they fell on their faces. They said, “The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, he is God! the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, he is God!”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">40</span> Elijah said to them, “Seize the
prophets of Baal! Don’t let one of them escape!”</p>
<p>They seized them; and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon,
and killed them there.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">41</span> Elijah said to Ahab, “Get up, eat
and drink; for there is the sound of abundance of rain.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">42</span> So Ahab went up to eat and to
drink. Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he bowed himself down on
the earth, and put his face between his knees. <span
class="bibleverse">43</span> He said to his servant, “Go up now and look
towards the sea.”</p>
<p>He went up and looked, then said, “There is nothing.”</p>
<p>He said, “Go again” seven times.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">44</span> On the seventh time, he said,
“Behold, a small cloud, like a man’s hand, is rising out of the
sea.”</p>
<p>He said, “Go up, tell Ahab, ‘Get ready and go down, so that the rain
doesn’t stop you.’”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">45</span> In a little while, the sky grew
black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. Ahab rode, and
went to Jezreel. <span class="bibleverse">46</span> The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s hand was on Elijah; and he tucked his
cloak into his belt and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.</p>
<h1 id="section-18">19</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah
had done, and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah,
saying, “So let the gods do to me, and more also, if I don’t make your
life as the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time!”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">3</span> When he saw that, he arose and ran
for his life, and came to Beersheba, which belongs to Judah, and left
his servant there. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> But he himself went
a day’s journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a
juniper tree. Then he requested for himself that he might die, and said,
“It is enough. Now, O <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, take away my
life; for I am not better than my fathers.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">5</span> He lay down and slept under a
juniper tree; and behold, an angel touched him, and said to him, “Arise
and eat!”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">6</span> He looked, and behold, there was at
his head a cake baked on the coals, and a jar of water. He ate and
drank, and lay down again. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s angel came again the second time, and
touched him, and said, “Arise and eat, because the journey is too great
for you.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">8</span> He arose, and ate and drank, and
went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights to Horeb,
God’s Mountain. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> He came to a cave
there, and camped there; and behold, the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s word came to him, and he said to him,
“What are you doing here, Elijah?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">10</span> He said, “I have been very jealous
for the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the God of Armies; for the
children of Israel have forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars,
and killed your prophets with the sword. I, even I only, am left; and
they seek my life, to take it away.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">11</span> He said, “Go out and stand on the
mountain before the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>.”</p>
<p>Behold, the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> passed by, and a
great and strong wind tore the mountains and broke in pieces the rocks
before the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>; but the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> was not in the wind. After the wind there
was an earthquake; but the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> was not
in the earthquake. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> After the
earthquake a fire passed; but the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>
was not in the fire. After the fire, there was a still small voice.
<span class="bibleverse">13</span> When Elijah heard it, he wrapped his
face in his mantle, went out, and stood in the entrance of the cave.
Behold, a voice came to him, and said, “What are you doing here,
Elijah?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">14</span> He said, “I have been very jealous
for the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the God of Armies; for the
children of Israel have forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars,
and killed your prophets with the sword. I, even I only, am left; and
they seek my life, to take it away.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">15</span> The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> said to him, “Go, return on your way to
the wilderness of Damascus. When you arrive, anoint Hazael to be king
over Syria. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> Anoint Jehu the son of
Nimshi to be king over Israel; and anoint Elisha the son of Shaphat of
Abel Meholah to be prophet in your place. <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> He who escapes from the sword of Hazael,
Jehu will kill; and he who escapes from the sword of Jehu, Elisha will
kill. <span class="bibleverse">18</span> Yet I reserved seven thousand
in Israel, all the knees of which have not bowed to Baal, and every
mouth which has not kissed him.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">19</span> So he departed from there and
found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was ploughing with twelve yoke of
oxen before him, and he with the twelfth. Elijah went over to him and
put his mantle on him. <span class="bibleverse">20</span> Elisha left
the oxen and ran after Elijah, and said, “Let me please kiss my father
and my mother, and then I will follow you.”</p>
<p>He said to him, “Go back again; for what have I done to you?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">21</span> He returned from following him,
and took the yoke of oxen, killed them, and boiled their meat with the
oxen’s equipment, and gave to the people; and they ate. Then he arose,
and went after Elijah, and served him.</p>
<h1 id="section-19">20</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Ben Hadad the king of Syria
gathered all his army together; and there were thirty-two kings with
him, with horses and chariots. He went up and besieged Samaria, and
fought against it. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> He sent messengers
into the city to Ahab king of Israel and said to him, “Ben Hadad says,
<span class="bibleverse">3</span> ‘Your silver and your gold are mine.
Your wives also and your children, even the best, are mine.’”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">4</span> The king of Israel answered, “It is
according to your saying, my lord, O king. I am yours, and all that I
have.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">5</span> The messengers came again and said,
“Ben Hadad says, ‘I sent indeed to you, saying, “You shall deliver me
your silver, your gold, your wives, and your children; <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> but I will send my servants to you tomorrow
about this time, and they will search your house and the houses of your
servants. Whatever is pleasant in your eyes, they will put it in their
hand, and take it away.”’”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">7</span> Then the king of Israel called all
the elders of the land, and said, “Please notice how this man seeks
mischief; for he sent to me for my wives, and for my children, and for
my silver, and for my gold; and I didn’t deny him.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">8</span> All the elders and all the people
said to him, “Don’t listen, and don’t consent.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">9</span> Therefore he said to the messengers
of Ben Hadad, “Tell my lord the king, ‘All that you sent for to your
servant at the first I will do, but this thing I cannot do.’”</p>
<p>The messengers departed and brought him back the message. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> Ben Hadad sent to him, and said, “The gods
do so to me, and more also, if the dust of Samaria will be enough for
handfuls for all the people who follow me.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">11</span> The king of Israel answered, “Tell
him, ‘Don’t let him who puts on his armour brag like he who takes it
off.’”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">12</span> When Ben Hadad heard this message
as he was drinking, he and the kings in the pavilions, he said to his
servants, “Prepare to attack!” So they prepared to attack the city.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">13</span> Behold, a prophet came near to
Ahab king of Israel, and said, “The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>
says, ‘Have you seen all this great multitude? Behold, I will deliver it
into your hand today. Then you will know that I am the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>.’”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">14</span> Ahab said, “By whom?”</p>
<p>He said, “The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> says, ‘By the young
men of the princes of the provinces.’”</p>
<p>Then he said, “Who shall begin the battle?”</p>
<p>He answered, “You.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">15</span> Then he mustered the young men of
the princes of the provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty-two.
After them, he mustered all the people, even all the children of Israel,
being seven thousand. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> They went out
at noon. But Ben Hadad was drinking himself drunk in the pavilions, he
and the kings, the thirty-two kings who helped him. <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> The young men of the princes of the
provinces went out first; and Ben Hadad sent out, and they told him,
saying, “Men are coming out from Samaria.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">18</span> He said, “If they have come out
for peace, take them alive; or if they have come out for war, take them
alive.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">19</span> So these went out of the city, the
young men of the princes of the provinces, and the army which followed
them. <span class="bibleverse">20</span> They each killed his man. The
Syrians fled, and Israel pursued them. Ben Hadad the king of Syria
escaped on a horse with horsemen. <span class="bibleverse">21</span> The
king of Israel went out and struck the horses and chariots, and killed
the Syrians with a great slaughter. <span class="bibleverse">22</span>
The prophet came near to the king of Israel and said to him, “Go,
strengthen yourself, and plan what you must do, for at the return of the
year, the king of Syria will come up against you.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">23</span> The servants of the king of Syria
said to him, “Their god is a god of the hills; therefore they were
stronger than we. But let’s fight against them in the plain, and surely
we will be stronger than they. <span class="bibleverse">24</span> Do
this thing: take the kings away, every man out of his place, and put
captains in their place. <span class="bibleverse">25</span> Muster an
army like the army that you have lost, horse for horse and chariot for
chariot. We will fight against them in the plain, and surely we will be
stronger than they are.”</p>
<p>He listened to their voice and did so. <span
class="bibleverse">26</span> At the return of the year, Ben Hadad
mustered the Syrians and went up to Aphek to fight against Israel. <span
class="bibleverse">27</span> The children of Israel were mustered and
given provisions, and went against them. The children of Israel encamped
before them like two little flocks of young goats, but the Syrians
filled the country. <span class="bibleverse">28</span> A man of God came
near and spoke to the king of Israel, and said, “The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> says, ‘Because the Syrians have said, “The
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is a god of the hills, but he is not
a god of the valleys,” therefore I will deliver all this great multitude
into your hand, and you shall know that I am the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>.’”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">29</span> They encamped opposite each other
for seven days. Then on the seventh day the battle was joined; and the
children of Israel killed one hundred thousand footmen of the Syrians in
one day. <span class="bibleverse">30</span> But the rest fled to Aphek,
into the city; and the wall fell on twenty-seven thousand men who were
left. Ben Hadad fled and came into the city, into an inner room. <span
class="bibleverse">31</span> His servants said to him, “See now, we have
heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings. Please
let us put sackcloth on our bodies and ropes on our heads, and go out to
the king of Israel. Maybe he will save your life.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">32</span> So they put sackcloth on their
bodies and ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and
said, “Your servant Ben Hadad says, ‘Please let me live.’”</p>
<p>He said, “Is he still alive? He is my brother.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">33</span> Now the men observed diligently
and hurried to take this phrase; and they said, “Your brother Ben
Hadad.”</p>
<p>Then he said, “Go, bring him.”</p>
<p>Then Ben Hadad came out to him; and he caused him to come up into the
chariot. <span class="bibleverse">34</span> Ben Hadad said to him, “The
cities which my father took from your father I will restore. You shall
make streets for yourself in Damascus, as my father made in
Samaria.”</p>
<p>“I”, said Ahab, “will let you go with this covenant.” So he made a
covenant with him and let him go.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">35</span> A certain man of the sons of the
prophets said to his fellow by the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s
word, “Please strike me!”</p>
<p>The man refused to strike him. <span class="bibleverse">36</span>
Then he said to him, “Because you have not obeyed the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s voice, behold, as soon as you have
departed from me, a lion will kill you.” As soon as he had departed from
him, a lion found him and killed him.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">37</span> Then he found another man, and
said, “Please strike me.”</p>
<p>The man struck him and wounded him. <span
class="bibleverse">38</span> So the prophet departed and waited for the
king by the way, and disguised himself with his headband over his eyes.
<span class="bibleverse">39</span> As the king passed by, he cried to
the king, and he said, “Your servant went out into the middle of the
battle; and behold, a man came over and brought a man to me, and said,
‘Guard this man! If by any means he is missing, then your life shall be
for his life, or else you shall pay a talent<a href="#fn28"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a>
of silver.’ <span class="bibleverse">40</span> As your servant was busy
here and there, he was gone.”</p>
<p>The king of Israel said to him, “So shall your judgement be. You
yourself have decided it.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">41</span> He hurried, and took the headband
away from his eyes; and the king of Israel recognised that he was one of
the prophets. <span class="bibleverse">42</span> He said to him, “The
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> says, ‘Because you have let go out
of your hand the man whom I had devoted to destruction, therefore your
life will take the place of his life, and your people take the place of
his people.’”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">43</span> The king of Israel went to his
house sullen and angry, and came to Samaria.</p>
<h1 id="section-20">21</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> After these things, Naboth the
Jezreelite had a vineyard which was in Jezreel, next to the palace of
Ahab king of Samaria. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> Ahab spoke to
Naboth, saying, “Give me your vineyard, that I may have it for a garden
of herbs, because it is near my house; and I will give you for it a
better vineyard than it. Or, if it seems good to you, I will give you
its worth in money.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">3</span> Naboth said to Ahab, “May the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> forbid me, that I should give the
inheritance of my fathers to you!”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">4</span> Ahab came into his house sullen and
angry because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him,
for he had said, “I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers.” He
laid himself down on his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no
bread. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> But Jezebel his wife came to
him, and said to him, “Why is your spirit so sad that you eat no
bread?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">6</span> He said to her, “Because I spoke to
Naboth the Jezreelite, and said to him, ‘Give me your vineyard for
money; or else, if it pleases you, I will give you another vineyard for
it.’ He answered, ‘I will not give you my vineyard.’”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">7</span> Jezebel his wife said to him, “Do
you now govern the kingdom of Israel? Arise, and eat bread, and let your
heart be merry. I will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.”
<span class="bibleverse">8</span> So she wrote letters in Ahab’s name
and sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters to the elders and to
the nobles who were in his city, who lived with Naboth. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> She wrote in the letters, saying, “Proclaim
a fast, and set Naboth on high amongst the people. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> Set two men, wicked fellows, before him,
and let them testify against him, saying, ‘You cursed God and the king!’
Then carry him out, and stone him to death.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">11</span> The men of his city, even the
elders and the nobles who lived in his city, did as Jezebel had
instructed them in the letters which she had written and sent to them.
<span class="bibleverse">12</span> They proclaimed a fast, and set
Naboth on high amongst the people. <span class="bibleverse">13</span>
The two men, the wicked fellows, came in and sat before him. The wicked
fellows testified against him, even against Naboth, in the presence of
the people, saying, “Naboth cursed God and the king!” Then they carried
him out of the city and stoned him to death with stones. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, “Naboth
has been stoned and is dead.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">15</span> When Jezebel heard that Naboth had
been stoned and was dead, Jezebel said to Ahab, “Arise, take possession
of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give you
for money; for Naboth is not alive, but dead.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">16</span> When Ahab heard that Naboth was
dead, Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite,
to take possession of it.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">17</span> The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s word came to Elijah the Tishbite,
saying, <span class="bibleverse">18</span> “Arise, go down to meet Ahab
king of Israel, who dwells in Samaria. Behold, he is in the vineyard of
Naboth, where he has gone down to take possession of it. <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> You shall speak to him, saying, ‘The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> says, “Have you killed and also taken
possession?”’ You shall speak to him, saying, ‘The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> says, “In the place where dogs licked the
blood of Naboth, dogs will lick your blood, even yours.”’”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">20</span> Ahab said to Elijah, “Have you
found me, my enemy?”</p>
<p>He answered, “I have found you, because you have sold yourself to do
that which is evil in the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s sight.
<span class="bibleverse">21</span> Behold, I will bring evil on you, and
will utterly sweep you away and will cut off from Ahab everyone who
urinates against a wall,<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a> and him who is shut up
and him who is left at large in Israel. <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> I will make your house like the house of
Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of
Ahijah, for the provocation with which you have provoked me to anger,
and have made Israel to sin.” <span class="bibleverse">23</span> The
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> also spoke of Jezebel, saying, “The
dogs will eat Jezebel by the rampart of Jezreel. <span
class="bibleverse">24</span> The dogs will eat he who dies of Ahab in
the city; and the birds of the sky will eat he who dies in the
field.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">25</span> But there was no one like Ahab,
who sold himself to do that which was evil in the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s sight, whom Jezebel his wife stirred up.
<span class="bibleverse">26</span> He did very abominably in following
idols, according to all that the Amorites did, whom the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> cast out before the children of
Israel.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">27</span> When Ahab heard those words, he
tore his clothes, put sackcloth on his body, fasted, lay in sackcloth,
and went about despondently.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">28</span> The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s word came to Elijah the Tishbite,
saying, <span class="bibleverse">29</span> “See how Ahab humbles himself
before me? Because he humbles himself before me, I will not bring the
evil in his days; but I will bring the evil on his house in his son’s
day.”</p>
<h1 id="section-21">22</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> They continued three years without
war between Syria and Israel. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> In the
third year, Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of
Israel. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> The king of Israel said to his
servants, “You know that Ramoth Gilead is ours, and we do nothing, and
don’t take it out of the hand of the king of Syria?” <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> He said to Jehoshaphat, “Will you go with me
to battle to Ramoth Gilead?”</p>
<p>Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, “I am as you are, my people
as your people, my horses as your horses.” <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel,
“Please enquire first for the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s
word.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">6</span> Then the king of Israel gathered
the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said to them, “Should
I go against Ramoth Gilead to battle, or should I refrain?”</p>
<p>They said, “Go up; for the Lord will deliver it into the hand of the
king.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">7</span> But Jehoshaphat said, “Isn’t there
here a prophet of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, that we may
enquire of him?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">8</span> The king of Israel said to
Jehoshaphat, “There is yet one man by whom we may enquire of the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, Micaiah the son of Imlah; but I hate him,
for he does not prophesy good concerning me, but evil.”</p>
<p>Jehoshaphat said, “Don’t let the king say so.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">9</span> Then the king of Israel called an
officer, and said, “Quickly get Micaiah the son of Imlah.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">10</span> Now the king of Israel and
Jehoshaphat the king of Judah were sitting each on his throne, arrayed
in their robes, in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Samaria;
and all the prophets were prophesying before them. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made himself
horns of iron, and said, “The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> says,
‘With these you will push the Syrians, until they are consumed.’” <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> All the prophets prophesied so, saying, “Go
up to Ramoth Gilead and prosper; for the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> will deliver it into the hand of the
king.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">13</span> The messenger who went to call
Micaiah spoke to him, saying, “See now, the prophets declare good to the
king with one mouth. Please let your word be like the word of one of
them, and speak good.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">14</span> Micaiah said, “As the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> lives, what the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> says to me, that I will speak.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">15</span> When he had come to the king, the
king said to him, “Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth Gilead to battle, or
shall we forbear?”</p>
<p>He answered him, “Go up and prosper; and the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> will deliver it into the hand of the
king.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">16</span> The king said to him, “How many
times do I have to adjure you that you speak to me nothing but the truth
in the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s name?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">17</span> He said, “I saw all Israel
scattered on the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd. The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> said, ‘These have no master. Let them each
return to his house in peace.’”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">18</span> The king of Israel said to
Jehoshaphat, “Didn’t I tell you that he would not prophesy good
concerning me, but evil?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">19</span> Micaiah said, “Therefore hear the
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s word. I saw the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> sitting on his throne, and all the army of
heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left. <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>
said, ‘Who will entice Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth
Gilead?’ One said one thing, and another said another.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">21</span> A spirit came out and stood before
the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and said, ‘I will entice
him.’</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">22</span> The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> said to him, ‘How?’</p>
<p>He said, ‘I will go out and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of
all his prophets.’</p>
<p>He said, ‘You will entice him, and will also prevail. Go out and do
so.’ <span class="bibleverse">23</span> Now therefore, behold, the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> has put a lying spirit in the mouth of all
these your prophets; and the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> has
spoken evil concerning you.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">24</span> Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah
came near and struck Micaiah on the cheek, and said, “Which way did the
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s Spirit go from me to speak to
you?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">25</span> Micaiah said, “Behold, you will
see on that day when you go into an inner room to hide yourself.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">26</span> The king of Israel said, “Take
Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city and to
Joash the king’s son. <span class="bibleverse">27</span> Say, ‘The king
says, “Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of
affliction and with water of affliction, until I come in peace.”’”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">28</span> Micaiah said, “If you return at
all in peace, the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> has not spoken by
me.” He said, “Listen, all you people!”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">29</span> So the king of Israel and
Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth Gilead. <span
class="bibleverse">30</span> The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “I
will disguise myself and go into the battle, but you put on your robes.”
The king of Israel disguised himself and went into the battle.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">31</span> Now the king of Syria had
commanded the thirty-two captains of his chariots, saying, “Don’t fight
with small nor great, except only with the king of Israel.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">32</span> When the captains of the chariots
saw Jehoshaphat, they said, “Surely that is the king of Israel!” and
they came over to fight against him. Jehoshaphat cried out. <span
class="bibleverse">33</span> When the captains of the chariots saw that
it was not the king of Israel, they turned back from pursuing him. <span
class="bibleverse">34</span> A certain man drew his bow at random, and
struck the king of Israel between the joints of the armour. Therefore he
said to the driver of his chariot, “Turn around, and carry me out of the
battle, for I am severely wounded.” <span class="bibleverse">35</span>
The battle increased that day. The king was propped up in his chariot
facing the Syrians, and died at evening. The blood ran out of the wound
into the bottom of the chariot. <span class="bibleverse">36</span> A cry
went throughout the army about the going down of the sun, saying, “Every
man to his city, and every man to his country!”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">37</span> So the king died, and was brought
to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria. <span
class="bibleverse">38</span> They washed the chariot by the pool of
Samaria; and the dogs licked up his blood where the prostitutes washed
themselves, according to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s word
which he spoke.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">39</span> Now the rest of the acts of Ahab,
and all that he did, and the ivory house which he built, and all the
cities that he built, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles
of the kings of Israel? <span class="bibleverse">40</span> So Ahab slept
with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his place.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">41</span> Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began
to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel. <span
class="bibleverse">42</span> Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when
he began to reign; and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem. His
mother’s name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi. <span
class="bibleverse">43</span> He walked in all the way of Asa his father.
He didn’t turn away from it, doing that which was right in the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s eyes. However, the high places were not
taken away. The people still sacrificed and burnt incense on the high
places. <span class="bibleverse">44</span> Jehoshaphat made peace with
the king of Israel.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">45</span> Now the rest of the acts of
Jehoshaphat, and his might that he showed, and how he fought, aren’t
they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? <span
class="bibleverse">46</span> The remnant of the sodomites, that remained
in the days of his father Asa, he put away out of the land. <span
class="bibleverse">47</span> There was no king in Edom. A deputy ruled.
<span class="bibleverse">48</span> Jehoshaphat made ships of Tarshish to
go to Ophir for gold, but they didn’t go, for the ships wrecked at Ezion
Geber. <span class="bibleverse">49</span> Then Ahaziah the son of Ahab
said to Jehoshaphat, “Let my servants go with your servants in the
ships.” But Jehoshaphat would not. <span class="bibleverse">50</span>
Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in
his father David’s city. Jehoram his son reigned in his place.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">51</span> Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to
reign over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king
of Judah, and he reigned two years over Israel. <span
class="bibleverse">52</span> He did that which was evil in the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s sight, and walked in the way of his
father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam the son
of Nebat, in which he made Israel to sin. <span
class="bibleverse">53</span> He served Baal and worshipped him, and
provoked the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, to
anger in all the ways that his father had done so.</p>
