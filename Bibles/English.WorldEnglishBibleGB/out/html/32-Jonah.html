<h2 id="jonahs-call-disobedience-and-punishment">Jonah's call,
disobedience and punishment</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Now the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> word came to Jonah the
son of Amittai, saying, <span class="bibleverse">2</span> “Arise, go to
Nineveh, that great city, and preach against it, for their wickedness
has come up before me.” <span class="bibleverse">3</span> But Jonah rose
up to flee to Tarshish from the presence of the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. He went down to Joppa, and found a ship
going to Tarshish; so he paid its fare, and went down into it, to go
with them to Tarshish from the presence of the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> But the
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> sent out a great wind on the sea,
and there was a mighty storm on the sea, so that the ship was likely to
break up. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> Then the mariners were
afraid, and every man cried to his god. They threw the cargo that was in
the ship into the sea to lighten the ship. But Jonah had gone down into
the innermost parts of the ship and he was laying down, and was fast
asleep. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> So the ship master came to
him, and said to him, “What do you mean, sleeper? Arise, call on your
God!<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Maybe your God<a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>
will notice us, so that we won’t perish.” <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> They all said to each other, “Come! Let’s
cast lots, that we may know who is responsible for this evil that is on
us.” So they cast lots, and the lot fell on Jonah. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> Then they asked him, “Tell us, please, for
whose cause this evil is on us. What is your occupation? Where do you
come from? What is your country? Of what people are you?” <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> He said to them, “I am a Hebrew, and I fear
the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the God<a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> of
heaven, who has made the sea and the dry land.” <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> Then the men were exceedingly afraid, and
said to him, “What have you done?” For the men knew that he was fleeing
from the presence of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, because he
had told them. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> Then they said to him,
“What shall we do to you, that the sea may be calm to us?” For the sea
grew more and more stormy. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> He said to
them, “Take me up, and throw me into the sea. Then the sea will be calm
for you; for I know that because of me this great storm is on you.”
<span class="bibleverse">13</span> Nevertheless the men rowed hard to
get them back to the land; but they could not, for the sea grew more and
more stormy against them. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> Therefore
they cried to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and said, “We beg
you, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, we beg you, don’t let us die
for this man’s life, and don’t lay on us innocent blood; for you, <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, have done as it pleased you.” <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> So they took up Jonah and threw him into
the sea; and the sea ceased its raging. <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> Then the men feared the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> exceedingly; and they offered a sacrifice
to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> and made vows. <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>
prepared a huge fish to swallow up Jonah, and Jonah was in the belly of
the fish three days and three nights.</p>
<h1 id="section-1">2</h1>
<h2 id="jonah-prayer-and-salvation">Jonah prayer and salvation</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Then Jonah prayed to the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, his God, out of the fish’s belly. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> He said, “I called because of my affliction
to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. He answered me. Out of the
belly of Sheol<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> I cried. You heard my voice. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> For you threw me into the depths, in the
heart of the seas. The flood was all around me. All your waves and your
billows passed over me. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> I said, ‘I
have been banished from your sight; yet I will look again towards your
holy temple.’ <span class="bibleverse">5</span> The waters surrounded
me, even to the soul. The deep was around me. The weeds were wrapped
around my head. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> I went down to the
bottoms of the mountains. The earth barred me in forever; yet you have
brought my life up from the pit, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> my
God. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> “When my soul fainted within me,
I remembered the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. My prayer came in
to you, into your holy temple. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> Those
who regard vain idols forsake their own mercy. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> But I will sacrifice to you with the voice
of thanksgiving. I will pay that which I have vowed. Salvation belongs
to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>.” <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> Then The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> spoke to the fish, and it vomited out
Jonah on the dry land.</p>
<h1 id="section-2">3</h1>
<h2 id="jonah-successful-penitential-sermon-in-nineveh">Jonah successful
penitential sermon in Nineveh</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s word came to Jonah the second time,
saying, <span class="bibleverse">2</span> “Arise, go to Nineveh, that
great city, and preach to it the message that I give you.” <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> So Jonah arose, and went to Nineveh,
according to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s word. Now Nineveh
was an exceedingly great city, three days’ journey across. <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> Jonah began to enter into the city a day’s
journey, and he cried out, and said, “In forty days, Nineveh will be
overthrown!” <span class="bibleverse">5</span> The people of Nineveh
believed God; and they proclaimed a fast and put on sackcloth, from
their greatest even to their least. <span class="bibleverse">6</span>
The news reached the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, took
off his royal robe, covered himself with sackcloth, and sat in ashes.
<span class="bibleverse">7</span> He made a proclamation and published
through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, “Let
neither man nor animal, herd nor flock, taste anything; let them not
feed, nor drink water; <span class="bibleverse">8</span> but let them be
covered with sackcloth, both man and animal, and let them cry mightily
to God. Yes, let them turn everyone from his evil way and from the
violence that is in his hands. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> Who
knows whether God will not turn and relent, and turn away from his
fierce anger, so that we might not perish?” <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> God saw their works, that they turned from
their evil way. God relented of the disaster which he said he would do
to them, and he didn’t do it.</p>
<h1 id="section-3">4</h1>
<h2 id="jonah-disgust-and-rebuke">Jonah disgust and rebuke</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> But it displeased Jonah
exceedingly, and he was angry. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> He
prayed to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and said, “Please,
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, wasn’t this what I said when I was
still in my own country? Therefore I hurried to flee to Tarshish, for I
knew that you are a gracious God and merciful, slow to anger, and
abundant in loving kindness, and you relent of doing harm. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> Therefore now, <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, take, I beg you, my life from me, for it
is better for me to die than to live.” <span class="bibleverse">4</span>
The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> said, “Is it right for you to be
angry?” <span class="bibleverse">5</span> Then Jonah went out of the
city and sat on the east side of the city, and there made himself a
booth and sat under it in the shade, until he might see what would
become of the city. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> God prepared a vine and made it to come up
over Jonah, that it might be a shade over his head to deliver him from
his discomfort. So Jonah was exceedingly glad because of the vine. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> But God prepared a worm at dawn the next
day, and it chewed on the vine so that it withered. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> When the sun arose, God prepared a sultry
east wind; and the sun beat on Jonah’s head, so that he was faint and
requested for himself that he might die. He said, “It is better for me
to die than to live.” <span class="bibleverse">9</span> God said to
Jonah, “Is it right for you to be angry about the vine?” He said, “I am
right to be angry, even to death.” <span class="bibleverse">10</span>
The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> said, “You have been concerned
for the vine, for which you have not laboured, neither made it grow;
which came up in a night and perished in a night. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> Shouldn’t I be concerned for Nineveh, that
great city, in which are more than one hundred and twenty thousand
persons who can’t discern between their right hand and their left hand,
and also many animals?”</p>
