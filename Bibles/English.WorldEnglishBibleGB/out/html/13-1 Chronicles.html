thousand and seven hundred and sixty that were able to go out to war.
<span class="bibleverse">19</span> They made war with the Hagrites, with
Jetur, and Naphish, and Nodab. <span class="bibleverse">20</span> They
were helped against them, and the Hagrites were delivered into their
hand, and all who were with them; for they cried to God in the battle,
and he answered them because they put their trust in him. <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> They took away their livestock: of their
camels fifty thousand, and of sheep two hundred and fifty thousand, and
of donkeys two thousand, and of men one hundred thousand. <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> For many fell slain, because the war was of
God. They lived in their place until the captivity.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">23</span> The children of the half-tribe of
Manasseh lived in the land. They increased from Bashan to Baal Hermon,
Senir, and Mount Hermon. <span class="bibleverse">24</span> These were
the heads of their fathers’ houses: Epher, Ishi, Eliel, Azriel,
Jeremiah, Hodaviah, and Jahdiel—mighty men of valour, famous men, heads
of their fathers’ houses. <span class="bibleverse">25</span> They
trespassed against the God of their fathers, and played the prostitute
after the gods of the peoples of the land whom God destroyed before
them. <span class="bibleverse">26</span> So the God of Israel stirred up
the spirit of Pul king of Assyria, and the spirit of Tilgath Pilneser
king of Assyria, and he carried away the Reubenites, the Gadites, and
the half-tribe of Manasseh, and brought them to Halah, Habor, Hara, and
to the river of Gozan, to this day.</p>

them in time past, and the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> was with
him. <span class="bibleverse">21</span> Zechariah the son of Meshelemiah
was gatekeeper of the door of the Tent of Meeting. <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> All these who were chosen to be gatekeepers
in the thresholds were two hundred and twelve. These were listed by
genealogy in their villages, whom David and Samuel the seer ordained in
their office of trust. <span class="bibleverse">23</span> So they and
their children had the oversight of the gates of the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s house, even the house of the tent, as
guards. <span class="bibleverse">24</span> On the four sides were the
gatekeepers, towards the east, west, north, and south. <span
class="bibleverse">25</span> Their brothers, in their villages, were to
come in every seven days from time to time to be with them, <span
class="bibleverse">26</span> for the four chief gatekeepers, who were
Levites, were in an office of trust, and were over the rooms and over
the treasuries in God’s house. <span class="bibleverse">27</span> They
stayed around God’s house, because that was their duty; and it was their
duty to open it morning by morning.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">28</span> Certain of them were in charge of
the vessels of service, for these were brought in by count, and these
were taken out by count. <span class="bibleverse">29</span> Some of them
also were appointed over the furniture, and over all the vessels of the
sanctuary, over the fine flour, the wine, the oil, the frankincense, and
the spices.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">30</span> Some of the sons of the priests
prepared the mixing of the spices. <span class="bibleverse">31</span>
Mattithiah, one of the Levites, who was the firstborn of Shallum the
Korahite, had the office of trust over the things that were baked in
pans. <span class="bibleverse">32</span> Some of their brothers, of the
sons of the Kohathites, were over the show bread, to prepare it every
Sabbath.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">33</span> These are the singers, heads of
fathers’ households of the Levites, who lived in the rooms and were free
from other service, for they were employed in their work day and night.
<span class="bibleverse">34</span> These were heads of fathers’
households of the Levites, throughout their generations, chief men. They
lived at Jerusalem.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">35</span> Jeiel the father of Gibeon, whose
wife’s name was Maacah, lived in Gibeon. <span
class="bibleverse">36</span> His firstborn son was Abdon, then Zur,
Kish, Baal, Ner, Nadab, <span class="bibleverse">37</span> Gedor, Ahio,
Zechariah, and Mikloth. <span class="bibleverse">38</span> Mikloth
became the father of Shimeam. They also lived with their relatives in
Jerusalem, near their relatives. <span class="bibleverse">39</span> Ner
became the father of Kish. Kish became the father of Saul. Saul became
the father of Jonathan, Malchishua, Abinadab, and Eshbaal. <span
class="bibleverse">40</span> The son of Jonathan was Merib-baal.
Merib-baal became the father of Micah. <span
class="bibleverse">41</span> The sons of Micah: Pithon, Melech, Tahrea,
and Ahaz. <span class="bibleverse">42</span> Ahaz became the father of
Jarah. Jarah became the father of Alemeth, Azmaveth, and Zimri. Zimri
became the father of Moza. <span class="bibleverse">43</span> Moza
became the father of Binea, Rephaiah his son, Eleasah his son, and Azel
his son. <span class="bibleverse">44</span> Azel had six sons, whose
names are Azrikam, Bocheru, Ishmael, Sheariah, Obadiah, and Hanan. These
were the sons of Azel.</p>
<h1 id="section-9">10</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Now the Philistines fought against
Israel; and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell
down slain on Mount Gilboa. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> The
Philistines followed hard after Saul and after his sons; and the
Philistines killed Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchishua, the sons of Saul.
<span class="bibleverse">3</span> The battle went hard against Saul, and
the archers overtook him; and he was distressed by reason of the
archers. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> Then Saul said to his armour
bearer, “Draw your sword, and thrust me through with it, lest these
uncircumcised come and abuse me.”</p>
<p>But his armour bearer would not, for he was terrified. Therefore Saul
took his sword and fell on it. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> When
his armour bearer saw that Saul was dead, he likewise fell on his sword
and died. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> So Saul died with his three
sons; and all his house died together. <span class="bibleverse">7</span>
When all the men of Israel who were in the valley saw that they fled,
and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned their cities, and
fled; and the Philistines came and lived in them.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">8</span> On the next day, when the
Philistines came to strip the slain, they found Saul and his sons fallen
on Mount Gilboa. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> They stripped him and
took his head and his armour, then sent into the land of the Philistines
all around to carry the news to their idols and to the people. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> They put his armour in the house of their
gods, and fastened his head in the house of Dagon. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> When all Jabesh Gilead heard all that the
Philistines had done to Saul, <span class="bibleverse">12</span> all the
valiant men arose and took away the body of Saul and the bodies of his
sons, and brought them to Jabesh, and buried their bones under the oak
in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">13</span> So Saul died for his trespass
which he committed against the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>,
because of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s word, which he
didn’t keep, and also because he asked counsel of one who had a familiar
spirit, to enquire, <span class="bibleverse">14</span> and didn’t
enquire of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. Therefore he killed
him, and turned the kingdom over to David the son of Jesse.</p>
<h1 id="section-10">11</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Then all Israel gathered themselves
to David to Hebron, saying, “Behold, we are your bone and your flesh.
<span class="bibleverse">2</span> In times past, even when Saul was
king, it was you who led out and brought in Israel. The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> your God said to you, ‘You shall be
shepherd of my people Israel, and you shall be prince over my people
Israel.’”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">3</span> So all the elders of Israel came to
the king to Hebron; and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before
the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. They anointed David king over
Israel, according to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s word by
Samuel.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">4</span> David and all Israel went to
Jerusalem (also called Jebus); and the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the
land, were there. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> The inhabitants of
Jebus said to David, “You will not come in here!” Nevertheless David
took the stronghold of Zion. The same is David’s city. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> David had said, “Whoever strikes the
Jebusites first shall be chief and captain.” Joab the son of Zeruiah
went up first, and was made chief. <span class="bibleverse">7</span>
David lived in the stronghold; therefore they called it David’s city.
<span class="bibleverse">8</span> He built the city all around, from
Millo even around; and Joab repaired the rest of the city. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> David grew greater and greater, for the
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> of Armies was with him.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">10</span> Now these are the chief of the
mighty men whom David had, who showed themselves strong with him in his
kingdom, together with all Israel, to make him king, according to the
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s word concerning Israel.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">11</span> This is the number of the mighty
men whom David had: Jashobeam, the son of a Hachmonite, the chief of the
thirty; he lifted up his spear against three hundred and killed them at
one time. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> After him was Eleazar the
son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighty men. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> He was with David at Pasdammim, and there
the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where there was a plot
of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the
Philistines. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> They stood in the middle
of the plot, defended it, and killed the Philistines; and the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> saved them by a great victory.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">15</span> Three of the thirty chief men went
down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the army of the
Philistines were encamped in the valley of Rephaim. <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> David was then in the stronghold, and the
garrison of the Philistines was in Bethlehem at that time. <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> David longed, and said, “Oh, that someone
would give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem, which is by the
gate!”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">18</span> The three broke through the army
of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem that was
by the gate, took it, and brought it to David; but David would not drink
any of it, but poured it out to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>,
<span class="bibleverse">19</span> and said, “My God forbid me, that I
should do this! Shall I drink the blood of these men who have put their
lives in jeopardy?” For they risked their lives to bring it. Therefore
he would not drink it. The three mighty men did these things.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">20</span> Abishai, the brother of Joab, was
chief of the three; for he lifted up his spear against three hundred and
killed them, and had a name amongst the three. <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> Of the three, he was more honourable than
the two, and was made their captain; however he wasn’t included in the
three.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">22</span> Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the
son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done mighty deeds, killed the
two sons of Ariel of Moab. He also went down and killed a lion in the
middle of a pit on a snowy day. <span class="bibleverse">23</span> He
killed an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits<a href="#fn7"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>
high. In the Egyptian’s hand was a spear like a weaver’s beam; and he
went down to him with a staff, plucked the spear out of the Egyptian’s
hand, and killed him with his own spear. <span
class="bibleverse">24</span> Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did these
things and had a name amongst the three mighty men. <span
class="bibleverse">25</span> Behold, he was more honourable than the
thirty, but he didn’t attain to the three; and David set him over his
guard.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">26</span> The mighty men of the armies also
include Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of
Bethlehem, <span class="bibleverse">27</span> Shammoth the Harorite,
Helez the Pelonite, <span class="bibleverse">28</span> Ira the son of
Ikkesh the Tekoite, Abiezer the Anathothite, <span
class="bibleverse">29</span> Sibbecai the Hushathite, Ilai the Ahohite,
<span class="bibleverse">30</span> Maharai the Netophathite, Heled the
son of Baanah the Netophathite, <span class="bibleverse">31</span> Ithai
the son of Ribai of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin, Benaiah the
Pirathonite, <span class="bibleverse">32</span> Hurai of the brooks of
Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite, <span class="bibleverse">33</span> Azmaveth
the Baharumite, Eliahba the Shaalbonite, <span

the son of Shagee the Hararite, <span class="bibleverse">35</span> Ahiam
the son of Sacar the Hararite, Eliphal the son of Ur, <span

Pelonite, <span class="bibleverse">37</span> Hezro the Carmelite, Naarai
the son of Ezbai, <span class="bibleverse">38</span> Joel the brother of
Nathan, Mibhar the son of Hagri, <span class="bibleverse">39</span>
Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Berothite (the armour bearer of Joab the
son of Zeruiah), <span class="bibleverse">40</span> Ira the Ithrite,
Gareb the Ithrite, <span class="bibleverse">41</span> Uriah the Hittite,
Zabad the son of Ahlai, <span class="bibleverse">42</span> Adina the son
of Shiza the Reubenite (a chief of the Reubenites), and thirty with him,
<span class="bibleverse">43</span> Hanan the son of Maacah, Joshaphat
the Mithnite, <span class="bibleverse">44</span> Uzzia the Ashterathite,
Shama and Jeiel the sons of Hotham the Aroerite, <span

brother, the Tizite, <span class="bibleverse">46</span> Eliel the
Mahavite, and Jeribai, and Joshaviah, the sons of Elnaam, and Ithmah the
Moabite, <span class="bibleverse">47</span> Eliel, Obed, and Jaasiel the
Mezobaite.</p>
<h1 id="section-11">12</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Now these are those who came to
David to Ziklag while he was a fugitive from Saul the son of Kish. They
were amongst the mighty men, his helpers in war. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> They were armed with bows, and could use
both the right hand and the left in slinging stones and in shooting
arrows from the bow. They were of Saul’s relatives of the tribe of
Benjamin. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> The chief was Ahiezer, then
Joash, the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite; Jeziel and Pelet, the sons of
Azmaveth; Beracah; Jehu the Anathothite; <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> Ishmaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man amongst
the thirty and a leader of the thirty; Jeremiah; Jahaziel; Johanan;
Jozabad the Gederathite; <span class="bibleverse">5</span> Eluzai;
Jerimoth; Bealiah; Shemariah; Shephatiah the Haruphite; <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> Elkanah, Isshiah, Azarel, Joezer, and
Jashobeam, the Korahites; <span class="bibleverse">7</span> and Joelah
and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham of Gedor.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">8</span> Some Gadites joined David in the
stronghold in the wilderness, mighty men of valour, men trained for war,
who could handle shield and spear; whose faces were like the faces of
lions, and they were as swift as the gazelles on the mountains: <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> Ezer the chief, Obadiah the second, Eliab
the third, <span class="bibleverse">10</span> Mishmannah the fourth,
Jeremiah the fifth, <span class="bibleverse">11</span> Attai the sixth,
Eliel the seventh, <span class="bibleverse">12</span> Johanan the
eighth, Elzabad the ninth, <span class="bibleverse">13</span> Jeremiah
the tenth, and Machbannai the eleventh. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> These of the sons of Gad were captains of
the army. He who was least was equal to one hundred, and the greatest to
one thousand. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> These are those who
went over the Jordan in the first month, when it had overflowed all its
banks; and they put to flight all who lived in the valleys, both towards
the east and towards the west.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">16</span> Some of the children of Benjamin
and Judah came to the stronghold to David. <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> David went out to meet them, and answered
them, “If you have come peaceably to me to help me, my heart will be
united with you; but if you have come to betray me to my adversaries,
since there is no wrong in my hands, may the God of our fathers see this
and rebuke it.” <span class="bibleverse">18</span> Then the Spirit came
on Amasai, who was chief of the thirty, and he said, “We are yours,
David, and on your side, you son of Jesse. Peace, peace be to you, and
peace be to your helpers; for your God helps you.” Then David received
them and made them captains of the band.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">19</span> Some of Manasseh also joined David
when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle, but they
didn’t help them, for the lords of the Philistines sent him away after
consultation, saying, “He will desert to his master Saul to the jeopardy
of our heads.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">20</span> As he went to Ziklag, some from
Manasseh joined him: Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu,
and Zillethai, captains of thousands who were of Manasseh. <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> They helped David against the band of
raiders, for they were all mighty men of valour and were captains in the
army. <span class="bibleverse">22</span> For from day to day men came to
David to help him, until there was a great army, like God’s army.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">23</span> These are the numbers of the heads
of those who were armed for war, who came to David to Hebron to turn the
kingdom of Saul to him, according to the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s word. <span class="bibleverse">24</span>
The children of Judah who bore shield and spear were six thousand and
eight hundred, armed for war. <span class="bibleverse">25</span> Of the
children of Simeon, mighty men of valour for the war: seven thousand and
one hundred. <span class="bibleverse">26</span> Of the children of Levi:
four thousand and six hundred. <span class="bibleverse">27</span>
Jehoiada was the leader of the household of Aaron; and with him were
three thousand and seven hundred, <span class="bibleverse">28</span> and
Zadok, a young man mighty of valour, and of his father’s house
twenty-two captains. <span class="bibleverse">29</span> Of the children
of Benjamin, Saul’s relatives: three thousand, for until then, the
greatest part of them had kept their allegiance to Saul’s house. <span
class="bibleverse">30</span> Of the children of Ephraim: twenty thousand
and eight hundred, mighty men of valour, famous men in their fathers’
houses. <span class="bibleverse">31</span> Of the half-tribe of
Manasseh: eighteen thousand, who were mentioned by name, to come and
make David king. <span class="bibleverse">32</span> Of the children of
Issachar, men who had understanding of the times, to know what Israel
ought to do, their heads were two hundred; and all their brothers were
at their command. <span class="bibleverse">33</span> Of Zebulun, such as
were able to go out in the army, who could set the battle in array with
all kinds of instruments of war: fifty thousand who could command and
were not of double heart. <span class="bibleverse">34</span> Of
Naphtali: one thousand captains, and with them with shield and spear
thirty-seven thousand. <span class="bibleverse">35</span> Of the Danites
who could set the battle in array: twenty-eight thousand and six
hundred. <span class="bibleverse">36</span> Of Asher, such as were able
to go out in the army, who could set the battle in array: forty
thousand. <span class="bibleverse">37</span> On the other side of the
Jordan, of the Reubenites, the Gadites, and of the half-tribe of
Manasseh, with all kinds of instruments of war for the battle: one
hundred and twenty thousand.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">38</span> All these were men of war who
could order the battle array, and came with a perfect heart to Hebron to
make David king over all Israel; and all the rest also of Israel were of
one heart to make David king. <span class="bibleverse">39</span> They
were there with David three days, eating and drinking; for their
brothers had supplied provisions for them. <span
class="bibleverse">40</span> Moreover those who were near to them, as
far as Issachar, Zebulun, and Naphtali, brought bread on donkeys, on
camels, on mules, and on oxen: supplies of flour, cakes of figs,
clusters of raisins, wine, oil, cattle, and sheep in abundance; for
there was joy in Israel.</p>
<h1 id="section-12">13</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> David consulted with the captains
of thousands and of hundreds, even with every leader. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> David said to all the assembly of Israel,
“If it seems good to you, and if it is of the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> our God, let’s send word everywhere to our
brothers who are left in all the land of Israel, with whom the priests
and Levites are in their cities that have pasture lands, that they may
gather themselves to us. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> Also, let’s
bring the ark of our God back to us again, for we didn’t seek it in the
days of Saul.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">4</span> All the assembly said that they
would do so, for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.
<span class="bibleverse">5</span> So David assembled all Israel
together, from the Shihor River of Egypt even to the entrance of Hamath,
to bring God’s ark from Kiriath Jearim.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">6</span> David went up with all Israel to
Baalah, that is, to Kiriath Jearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up
from there God the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s ark that sits
above the cherubim, that is called by the Name. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> They carried God’s ark on a new cart, and
brought it out of Abinadab’s house; and Uzza and Ahio drove the cart.
<span class="bibleverse">8</span> David and all Israel played before God
with all their might, even with songs, with harps, with stringed
instruments, with tambourines, with cymbals, and with trumpets.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">9</span> When they came to Chidon’s
threshing floor, Uzza put out his hand to hold the ark, for the oxen
stumbled. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s anger burnt against Uzza, and he struck
him because he put his hand on the ark; and he died there before God.
<span class="bibleverse">11</span> David was displeased, because the
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> had broken out against Uzza. He
called that place Perez Uzza, to this day. <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> David was afraid of God that day, saying,
“How can I bring God’s ark home to me?” <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> So David didn’t move the ark with him into
David’s city, but carried it aside into Obed-Edom the Gittite’s house.
<span class="bibleverse">14</span> God’s ark remained with the family of
Obed-Edom in his house three months; and the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> blessed Obed-Edom’s house and all that he
had.</p>
<h1 id="section-13">14</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers
to David with cedar trees, masons, and carpenters, to build him a house.
<span class="bibleverse">2</span> David perceived that the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> had established him king over Israel, for
his kingdom was highly exalted, for his people Israel’s sake.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">3</span> David took more wives in Jerusalem,
and David became the father of more sons and daughters. <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> These are the names of the children whom he
had in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> Ibhar, Elishua, Elpelet, <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia, <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> Elishama, Beeliada, and Eliphelet.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">8</span> When the Philistines heard that
David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to
seek David; and David heard of it, and went out against them. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> Now the Philistines had come and made a raid
in the valley of Rephaim. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> David
enquired of God, saying, “Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will
you deliver them into my hand?”</p>
<p>The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> said to him, “Go up; for I
will deliver them into your hand.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">11</span> So they came up to Baal Perazim,
and David defeated them there. David said, God has broken my enemies by
my hand, like waters breaking out. Therefore they called the name of
that place Baal Perazim.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> <span class="bibleverse">12</span>
They left their gods there; and David gave a command, and they were
burnt with fire.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">13</span> The Philistines made a another
raid in the valley. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> David enquired
again of God; and God said to him, “You shall not go up after them. Turn
away from them, and come on them opposite the mulberry trees. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> When you hear the sound of marching in the
tops of the mulberry trees, then go out to battle; for God has gone out
before you to strike the army of the Philistines.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">16</span> David did as God commanded him;
and they attacked the army of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gezer.
<span class="bibleverse">17</span> The fame of David went out into all
lands; and the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> brought the fear of
him on all nations.</p>
<h1 id="section-14">15</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> David made himself houses in
David’s city; and he prepared a place for God’s ark, and pitched a tent
for it. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> Then David said, “No one ought
to carry God’s ark but the Levites. For the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> has chosen them to carry God’s ark, and to
minister to him forever.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">3</span> David assembled all Israel at
Jerusalem, to bring up the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s ark to
its place, which he had prepared for it. <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> David gathered together the sons of Aaron
and the Levites: <span class="bibleverse">5</span> of the sons of
Kohath, Uriel the chief, and his brothers one hundred and twenty; <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> of the sons of Merari, Asaiah the chief, and
his brothers two hundred and twenty; <span class="bibleverse">7</span>
of the sons of Gershom, Joel the chief, and his brothers one hundred and
thirty; <span class="bibleverse">8</span> of the sons of Elizaphan,
Shemaiah the chief, and his brothers two hundred; <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> of the sons of Hebron, Eliel the chief, and
his brothers eighty; <span class="bibleverse">10</span> of the sons of
Uzziel, Amminadab the chief, and his brothers one hundred and
twelve.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">11</span> David called for Zadok and
Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites: for Uriel, Asaiah, Joel,
Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab, <span class="bibleverse">12</span> and
said to them, “You are the heads of the fathers’ households of the
Levites. Sanctify yourselves, both you and your brothers, that you may
bring the ark of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the God of
Israel, up to the place that I have prepared for it. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> For because you didn’t carry it at first,
the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> our God broke out in anger
against us, because we didn’t seek him according to the ordinance.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">14</span> So the priests and the Levites
sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> The children of the Levites bore God’s ark
on their shoulders with its poles, as Moses commanded according to the
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s word.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">16</span> David spoke to the chief of the
Levites to appoint their brothers as singers with instruments of music,
stringed instruments, harps, and cymbals, sounding aloud and lifting up
their voices with joy. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> So the Levites
appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brothers, Asaph the son of
Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brothers, Ethan the son of
Kushaiah; <span class="bibleverse">18</span> and with them their
brothers of the second rank: Zechariah, Ben, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth,
Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Eliphelehu,
Mikneiah, Obed-Edom, and Jeiel, the doorkeepers. <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan,
were given cymbals of bronze to sound aloud; <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> and Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel,
Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with stringed instruments set to
Alamoth; <span class="bibleverse">21</span> and Mattithiah, Eliphelehu,
Mikneiah, Obed-Edom, Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps tuned to the
eight-stringed lyre, to lead. <span class="bibleverse">22</span>
Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was over the singing. He taught the
singers, because he was skilful. <span class="bibleverse">23</span>
Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark. <span
class="bibleverse">24</span> Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai,
Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, blew the trumpets before
God’s ark; and Obed-Edom and Jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">25</span> So David, the elders of Israel,
and the captains over thousands went to bring the ark of the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s covenant up out of the house of
Obed-Edom with joy. <span class="bibleverse">26</span> When God helped
the Levites who bore the ark of the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s covenant, they sacrificed seven bulls
and seven rams. <span class="bibleverse">27</span> David was clothed
with a robe of fine linen, as were all the Levites who bore the ark, the
singers, and Chenaniah the choir master with the singers; and David had
an ephod of linen on him. <span class="bibleverse">28</span> Thus all
Israel brought the ark of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s
covenant up with shouting, with sound of the cornet, with trumpets, and
with cymbals, sounding aloud with stringed instruments and harps. <span
class="bibleverse">29</span> As the ark of the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s covenant came to David’s city, Michal
the daughter of Saul looked out at the window, and saw king David
dancing and playing; and she despised him in her heart.</p>
<h1 id="section-15">16</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> They brought in God’s ark, and set
it in the middle of the tent that David had pitched for it; and they
offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before God. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> When David had finished offering the burnt
offering and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s name. <span class="bibleverse">3</span>
He gave to everyone of Israel, both man and woman, to everyone a loaf of
bread, a portion of meat, and a cake of raisins.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">4</span> He appointed some of the Levites to
minister before the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s ark, and to
commemorate, to thank, and to praise the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel: <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> Asaph the chief, and second to him
Zechariah, then Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah,
Obed-Edom, and Jeiel, with stringed instruments and with harps; and
Asaph with cymbals, sounding aloud; <span class="bibleverse">6</span>
with Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually, before
the ark of the covenant of God.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">7</span> Then on that day David first
ordained giving of thanks to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> by
the hand of Asaph and his brothers. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> Oh
give thanks to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. Call on his
name. Make what he has done known amongst the peoples. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> Sing to him. Sing praises to him. Tell of
all his marvellous works. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> Glory in
his holy name. Let the heart of those who seek the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> rejoice. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> Seek the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> and his strength. Seek his face forever
more. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> Remember his marvellous works
that he has done, his wonders, and the judgements of his mouth, <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> you offspring<a href="#fn9"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> of
Israel his servant, you children of Jacob, his chosen ones. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> He is the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> our God. His judgements are in all the
earth. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> Remember his covenant forever,
the word which he commanded to a thousand generations, <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> the covenant which he made with Abraham,
his oath to Isaac. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> He confirmed it to
Jacob for a statute, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant, <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> saying, “I will give you the land of
Canaan, The lot of your inheritance,” <span class="bibleverse">19</span>
when you were but a few men in number, yes, very few, and foreigners in
it. <span class="bibleverse">20</span> They went about from nation to
nation, from one kingdom to another people. <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> He allowed no man to do them wrong. Yes, he
reproved kings for their sakes, <span class="bibleverse">22</span>
“Don’t touch my anointed ones! Do my prophets no harm!” <span
class="bibleverse">23</span> Sing to the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, all the earth! Display his salvation from
day to day. <span class="bibleverse">24</span> Declare his glory amongst
the nations, and his marvellous works amongst all the peoples. <span
class="bibleverse">25</span> For great is the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and greatly to be praised. He also is to
be feared above all gods. <span class="bibleverse">26</span> For all the
gods of the peoples are idols, but the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> made the heavens. <span
class="bibleverse">27</span> Honour and majesty are before him. Strength
and gladness are in his place. <span class="bibleverse">28</span>
Ascribe to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, you families of the
peoples, ascribe to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> glory and
strength! <span class="bibleverse">29</span> Ascribe to the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> the glory due to his name. Bring an
offering, and come before him. Worship the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> in holy array. <span
class="bibleverse">30</span> Tremble before him, all the earth. The
world also is established that it can’t be moved. <span
class="bibleverse">31</span> Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth
rejoice! Let them say amongst the nations, “The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> reigns!” <span
class="bibleverse">32</span> Let the sea roar, and its fullness! Let the
field exult, and all that is in it! <span class="bibleverse">33</span>
Then the trees of the forest will sing for joy before the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, for he comes to judge the earth. <span
class="bibleverse">34</span> Oh give thanks to the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, for he is good, for his loving kindness
endures forever. <span class="bibleverse">35</span> Say, “Save us, God
of our salvation! Gather us together and deliver us from the nations, to
give thanks to your holy name, to triumph in your praise.” <span
class="bibleverse">36</span> Blessed be the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, from everlasting even
to everlasting.</p>
<p>All the people said, “Amen,” and praised the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">37</span> So he left Asaph and his brothers
there before the ark of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s
covenant, to minister before the ark continually, as every day’s work
required; <span class="bibleverse">38</span> and Obed-Edom with their
sixty-eight relatives; Obed-Edom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah to
be doorkeepers; <span class="bibleverse">39</span> and Zadok the priest
and his brothers the priests, before the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s tabernacle in the high place that was at
Gibeon, <span class="bibleverse">40</span> to offer burnt offerings to
the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> on the altar of burnt offering
continually morning and evening, even according to all that is written
in the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s law, which he commanded to
Israel; <span class="bibleverse">41</span> and with them Heman and
Jeduthun and the rest who were chosen, who were mentioned by name, to
give thanks to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, because his
loving kindness endures forever; <span class="bibleverse">42</span> and
with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that
should sound aloud, and with instruments for the songs of God, and the
sons of Jeduthun to be at the gate. <span class="bibleverse">43</span>
All the people departed, each man to his house; and David returned to
bless his house.</p>
<h1 id="section-16">17</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> When David was living in his house,
David said to Nathan the prophet, “Behold, I live in a cedar house, but
the ark of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s covenant is in a
tent.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">2</span> Nathan said to David, “Do all that
is in your heart; for God is with you.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">3</span> That same night, the word of God
came to Nathan, saying, <span class="bibleverse">4</span> “Go and tell
David my servant, ‘The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> says, “You
shall not build me a house to dwell in; <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> for I have not lived in a house since the
day that I brought up Israel to this day, but have gone from tent to
tent, and from one tent to another. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> In
all places in which I have walked with all Israel, did I speak a word
with any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to be shepherd of my
people, saying, ‘Why have you not built me a house of cedar?’”’</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">7</span> “Now therefore, you shall tell my
servant David, ‘The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> of Armies says,
“I took you from the sheep pen, from following the sheep, to be prince
over my people Israel. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> I have been
with you wherever you have gone, and have cut off all your enemies from
before you. I will make you a name like the name of the great ones who
are in the earth. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> I will appoint a
place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in
their own place, and be moved no more. The children of wickedness will
not waste them any more, as at the first, <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> and from the day that I commanded judges to
be over my people Israel. I will subdue all your enemies. Moreover I
tell you that the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> will build you a
house. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> It will happen, when your days
are fulfilled that you must go to be with your fathers, that I will set
up your offspring after you, who will be of your sons; and I will
establish his kingdom. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> He will build
me a house, and I will establish his throne forever. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> I will be his father, and he will be my
son. I will not take my loving kindness away from him, as I took it from
him who was before you; <span class="bibleverse">14</span> but I will
settle him in my house and in my kingdom forever. His throne will be
established forever.”’” <span class="bibleverse">15</span> According to
all these words, and according to all this vision, so Nathan spoke to
David.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">16</span> Then David the king went in and
sat before the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>; and he said, “Who am
I, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> God, and what is my house, that
you have brought me this far? <span class="bibleverse">17</span> This
was a small thing in your eyes, O God, but you have spoken of your
servant’s house for a great while to come, and have respected me
according to the standard of a man of high degree, <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> God. <span class="bibleverse">18</span>
What can David say yet more to you concerning the honour which is done
to your servant? For you know your servant. <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, for
your servant’s sake, and according to your own heart, you have done all
this greatness, to make known all these great things. <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, there
is no one like you, neither is there any God besides you, according to
all that we have heard with our ears. <span class="bibleverse">21</span>
What one nation in the earth is like your people Israel, whom God went
to redeem to himself for a people, to make you a name by great and
awesome things, in driving out nations from before your people whom you
redeemed out of Egypt? <span class="bibleverse">22</span> For you made
your people Israel your own people forever; and you, <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, became their God. <span
class="bibleverse">23</span> Now, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>,
let the word that you have spoken concerning your servant, and
concerning his house, be established forever, and do as you have spoken.
<span class="bibleverse">24</span> Let your name be established and
magnified forever, saying, ‘The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> of
Armies is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel. The house of David
your servant is established before you.’ <span
class="bibleverse">25</span> For you, my God, have revealed to your
servant that you will build him a house. Therefore your servant has
found courage to pray before you. <span class="bibleverse">26</span>
Now, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, you are God, and have promised
this good thing to your servant. <span class="bibleverse">27</span> Now
it has pleased you to bless the house of your servant, that it may
continue forever before you; for you, <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, have blessed, and it is blessed
forever.”</p>
<h1 id="section-17">18</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> After this, David defeated the
Philistines and subdued them, and took Gath and its towns out of the
hand of the Philistines. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> He defeated
Moab; and the Moabites became servants to David and brought tribute.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">3</span> David defeated Hadadezer king of
Zobah, towards Hamath, as he went to establish his dominion by the river
Euphrates. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> David took from him one
thousand chariots, seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen;
and David hamstrung all the chariot horses, but reserved of them enough
for one hundred chariots. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> When the
Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah, David struck
twenty-two thousand men of the Syrians. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> Then David put garrisons in Syria of
Damascus; and the Syrians became servants to David and brought tribute.
The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> gave victory to David wherever
he went. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> David took the shields of
gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to
Jerusalem. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> From Tibhath and from Cun,
cities of Hadadezer, David took very much bronze, with which Solomon
made the bronze sea, the pillars, and the vessels of bronze.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">9</span> When Tou king of Hamath heard that
David had struck all the army of Hadadezer king of Zobah, <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> he sent Hadoram his son to king David to
greet him and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer and
struck him (for Hadadezer had wars with Tou); and he had with him all
kinds of vessels of gold and silver and bronze. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> King David also dedicated these to the
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, with the silver and the gold that
he carried away from all the nations: from Edom, from Moab, from the
children of Ammon, from the Philistines, and from Amalek.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">12</span> Moreover Abishai the son of
Zeruiah struck eighteen thousand of the Edomites in the Valley of Salt.
<span class="bibleverse">13</span> He put garrisons in Edom; and all the
Edomites became servants to David. The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> gave victory to David wherever he
went.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">14</span> David reigned over all Israel; and
he executed justice and righteousness for all his people. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the army;
Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder; <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> Zadok the son of Ahitub and Abimelech the
son of Abiathar were priests; Shavsha was scribe; <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over
the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David were chief
officials serving the king.</p>
<h1 id="section-18">19</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> After this, Nahash the king of the
children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his place. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> David said, “I will show kindness to Hanun
the son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me.”</p>
<p>So David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father.
David’s servants came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun to
comfort him. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> But the princes of the
children of Ammon said to Hanun, “Do you think that David honours your
father, in that he has sent comforters to you? Haven’t his servants come
to you to search, to overthrow, and to spy out the land?” <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> So Hanun took David’s servants, shaved them,
and cut off their garments in the middle at their buttocks, and sent
them away. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> Then some people went and
told David how the men were treated. He sent to meet them; for the men
were greatly humiliated. The king said, “Stay at Jericho until your
beards have grown, and then return.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">6</span> When the children of Ammon saw that
they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of
Ammon sent one thousand talents<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> of silver to hire
chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, out of Aram-maacah, and out of
Zobah. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> So they hired for themselves
thirty-two thousand chariots, and the king of Maacah with his people,
who came and encamped near Medeba. The children of Ammon gathered
themselves together from their cities, and came to battle. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> When David heard of it, he sent Joab with
all the army of the mighty men. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> The
children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the gate of
the city; and the kings who had come were by themselves in the
field.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">10</span> Now when Joab saw that the battle
was set against him before and behind, he chose some of all the choice
men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> The rest of the people he committed into
the hand of Abishai his brother; and they put themselves in array
against the children of Ammon. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> He
said, “If the Syrians are too strong for me, then you are to help me;
but if the children of Ammon are too strong for you, then I will help
you. <span class="bibleverse">13</span> Be courageous, and let’s be
strong for our people and for the cities of our God. May the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> do that which seems good to him.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">14</span> So Joab and the people who were
with him came near to the front of the Syrians to the battle; and they
fled before him. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> When the children of
Ammon saw that the Syrians had fled, they likewise fled before Abishai
his brother, and entered into the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">16</span> When the Syrians saw that they
were defeated by Israel, they sent messengers and called out the Syrians
who were beyond the River,<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> with Shophach the
captain of the army of Hadadezer leading them. <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> David was told that, so he gathered all
Israel together, passed over the Jordan, came to them, and set the
battle in array against them. So when David had put the battle in array
against the Syrians, they fought with him. <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> The Syrians fled before Israel; and David
killed of the Syrian men seven thousand charioteers and forty thousand
footmen, and also killed Shophach the captain of the army. <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> When the servants of Hadadezer saw that
they were defeated by Israel, they made peace with David and served him.
The Syrians would not help the children of Ammon any more.</p>
<h1 id="section-19">20</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> At the time of the return of the
year, at the time when kings go out, Joab led out the army and wasted
the country of the children of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah. But
David stayed at Jerusalem. Joab struck Rabbah, and overthrew it. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> David took the crown of their king from off
his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold,<a href="#fn12"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a>
and there were precious stones in it. It was set on David’s head, and he
brought very much plunder out of the city. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> He brought out the people who were in it,
and had them cut with saws, with iron picks, and with axes. David did so
to all the cities of the children of Ammon. Then David and all the
people returned to Jerusalem.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">4</span> After this, war arose at Gezer with
the Philistines. Then Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Sippai, of the sons
of the giant; and they were subdued.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">5</span> Again there was war with the
Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair killed Lahmi the brother of
Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam.
<span class="bibleverse">6</span> There was again war at Gath, where
there was a man of great stature, who had twenty-four fingers and toes,
six on each hand and six on each foot; and he also was born to the
giant. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> When he defied Israel, Jonathan
the son of Shimea, David’s brother, killed him. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> These were born to the giant in Gath; and
they fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants.</p>
<h1 id="section-20">21</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Satan stood up against Israel, and
moved David to take a census of Israel. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> David said to Joab and to the princes of the
people, “Go, count Israel from Beersheba even to Dan; and bring me word,
that I may know how many there are.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">3</span> Joab said, “May the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> make his people a hundred times as many as
they are. But, my lord the king, aren’t they all my lord’s servants? Why
does my lord require this thing? Why will he be a cause of guilt to
Israel?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">4</span> Nevertheless the king’s word
prevailed against Joab. Therefore Joab departed and went throughout all
Israel, then came to Jerusalem. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> Joab
gave the sum of the census of the people to David. All those of Israel
were one million one hundred thousand men who drew a sword; and in Judah
were four hundred and seventy thousand men who drew a sword. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> But he didn’t count Levi and Benjamin
amongst them, for the king’s word was abominable to Joab.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">7</span> God was displeased with this thing;
therefore he struck Israel. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> David said
to God, “I have sinned greatly, in that I have done this thing. But now
put away, I beg you, the iniquity of your servant, for I have done very
foolishly.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">9</span> The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> spoke to Gad, David’s seer, saying, <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> “Go and speak to David, saying, ‘The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> says, “I offer you three things. Choose
one of them, that I may do it to you.”’”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">11</span> So Gad came to David and said to
him, “The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> says, ‘Take your choice:
<span class="bibleverse">12</span> either three years of famine; or
three months to be consumed before your foes, while the sword of your
enemies overtakes you; or else three days of the sword of the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, even pestilence in the land, and the
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s angel destroying throughout all
the borders of Israel. Now therefore consider what answer I shall return
to him who sent me.’”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">13</span> David said to Gad, “I am in
distress. Let me fall, I pray, into the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s hand, for his mercies are very great.
Don’t let me fall into man’s hand.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">14</span> So the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> sent a pestilence on Israel, and seventy
thousand men of Israel fell. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> God sent
an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it. As he was about to destroy, the
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> saw, and he relented of the
disaster, and said to the destroying angel, “It is enough. Now withdraw
your hand.” the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s angel was standing
by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite. <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> David lifted up his eyes, and saw the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s angel standing between earth and the
sky, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell on their faces.
<span class="bibleverse">17</span> David said to God, “Isn’t it I who
commanded the people to be counted? It is even I who have sinned and
done very wickedly; but these sheep, what have they done? Please let
your hand, O <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> my God, be against me
and against my father’s house; but not against your people, that they
should be plagued.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">18</span> Then the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s angel commanded Gad to tell David that
David should go up and raise an altar to the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> on the threshing floor of Ornan the
Jebusite. <span class="bibleverse">19</span> David went up at the saying
of Gad, which he spoke in the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s
name.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">20</span> Ornan turned back and saw the
angel; and his four sons who were with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was
threshing wheat. <span class="bibleverse">21</span> As David came to
Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshing floor,
and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">22</span> Then David said to Ornan, “Sell me
the place of this threshing floor, that I may build an altar to the
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> on it. You shall sell it to me for
the full price, that the plague may be stopped from afflicting the
people.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">23</span> Ornan said to David, “Take it for
yourself, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes.
Behold, I give the oxen for burnt offerings, and the threshing
instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meal offering. I give it
all.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">24</span> King David said to Ornan, “No, but
I will most certainly buy it for the full price. For I will not take
that which is yours for the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, nor
offer a burnt offering that costs me nothing.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">25</span> So David gave to Ornan six hundred
shekels<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> of gold by weight for the place.
<span class="bibleverse">26</span> David built an altar to the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> there, and offered burnt offerings and
peace offerings, and called on the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>;
and he answered him from the sky by fire on the altar of burnt
offering.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">27</span> Then The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> commanded the angel, and he put his sword
back into its sheath.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">28</span> At that time, when David saw that
the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> had answered him in the
threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there. <span
class="bibleverse">29</span> For the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s tabernacle, which Moses made in the
wilderness, and the altar of burnt offering, were at that time in the
high place at Gibeon. <span class="bibleverse">30</span> But David
couldn’t go before it to enquire of God, for he was afraid because of
the sword of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s angel.</p>
<h1 id="section-21">22</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Then David said, “This is the house
of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> God, and this is the altar of
burnt offering for Israel.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">2</span> David gave orders to gather
together the foreigners who were in the land of Israel; and he set
masons to cut dressed stones to build God’s house. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> David prepared iron in abundance for the
nails for the doors of the gates and for the couplings, and bronze in
abundance without weight, <span class="bibleverse">4</span> and cedar
trees without number, for the Sidonians and the people of Tyre brought
cedar trees in abundance to David. <span class="bibleverse">5</span>
David said, “Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house that is
to be built for the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> must be
exceedingly magnificent, of fame and of glory throughout all countries.
I will therefore make preparation for it.” So David prepared abundantly
before his death. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> Then he called for
Solomon his son, and commanded him to build a house for the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> David said to Solomon his son, “As for me,
it was in my heart to build a house to the name of the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> my God. <span class="bibleverse">8</span>
But the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s word came to me, saying,
‘You have shed blood abundantly and have made great wars. You shall not
build a house to my name, because you have shed much blood on the earth
in my sight. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> Behold, a son shall be
born to you, who shall be a man of peace. I will give him rest from all
his enemies all around; for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give
peace and quietness to Israel in his days. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> He shall build a house for my name; and he
will be my son, and I will be his father; and I will establish the
throne of his kingdom over Israel forever.’ <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> Now, my son, may the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> be with you and prosper you, and build the
house of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> your God, as he has
spoken concerning you. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> May the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> give you discretion and understanding, and
put you in charge of Israel, so that you may keep the law of the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> your God. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> Then you will prosper, if you observe to do
the statutes and the ordinances which the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> gave Moses concerning Israel. Be strong
and courageous. Don’t be afraid and don’t be dismayed. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> Now, behold, in my affliction I have
prepared for the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s house one hundred
thousand talents<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> of gold, one million talents<a
href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> of silver, and bronze and iron
without weight; for it is in abundance. I have also prepared timber and
stone; and you may add to them. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> There
are also workmen with you in abundance—cutters and workers of stone and
timber, and all kinds of men who are skilful in every kind of work;
<span class="bibleverse">16</span> of the gold, the silver, the bronze,
and the iron, there is no number. Arise and be doing, and may the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> be with you.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">17</span> David also commanded all the
princes of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying, <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> “Isn’t the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> your God with you? Hasn’t he given you
rest on every side? For he has delivered the inhabitants of the land
into my hand; and the land is subdued before the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> and before his people. <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> Now set your heart and your soul to follow
the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> your God. Arise therefore, and
build the sanctuary of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> God, to
bring the ark of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s covenant and
the holy vessels of God into the house that is to be built for the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s name.”</p>
<h1 id="section-22">23</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Now David was old and full of days;
and he made Solomon his son king over Israel. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> He gathered together all the princes of
Israel, with the priests and the Levites. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> The Levites were counted from thirty years
old and upward; and their number by their polls, man by man, was
thirty-eight thousand. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> David said, “Of
these, twenty-four thousand were to oversee the work of the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s house, six thousand were officers and
judges, <span class="bibleverse">5</span> four thousand were
doorkeepers, and four thousand praised the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> with the instruments which I made for
giving praise.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">6</span> David divided them into divisions
according to the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">7</span> Of the Gershonites: Ladan and
Shimei. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> The sons of Ladan: Jehiel the
chief, Zetham, and Joel, three. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> The
sons of Shimei: Shelomoth, Haziel, and Haran, three. These were the
heads of the fathers’ households of Ladan. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> The sons of Shimei: Jahath, Zina, Jeush,
and Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second;
but Jeush and Beriah didn’t have many sons; therefore they became a
fathers’ house in one reckoning.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">12</span> The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar,
Hebron, and Uzziel, four. <span class="bibleverse">13</span> The sons of
Amram: Aaron and Moses; and Aaron was separated that he should sanctify
the most holy things, he and his sons forever, to burn incense before
the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, to minister to him, and to
bless in his name forever. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> But as for
Moses the man of God, his sons were named amongst the tribe of Levi.
<span class="bibleverse">15</span> The sons of Moses: Gershom and
Eliezer. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> The sons of Gershom: Shebuel
the chief. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> The son of Eliezer was
Rehabiah the chief; and Eliezer had no other sons, but the sons of
Rehabiah were very many. <span class="bibleverse">18</span> The son of
Izhar: Shelomith the chief. <span class="bibleverse">19</span> The sons
of Hebron: Jeriah the chief, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and
Jekameam the fourth. <span class="bibleverse">20</span> The sons of
Uzziel: Micah the chief, and Isshiah the second.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">21</span> The sons of Merari: Mahli and
Mushi. The sons of Mahli: Eleazar and Kish. <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> Eleazar died, and had no sons, but
daughters only; and their relatives, the sons of Kish, took them as
wives. <span class="bibleverse">23</span> The sons of Mushi: Mahli,
Eder, and Jeremoth, three.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">24</span> These were the sons of Levi after
their fathers’ houses, even the heads of the fathers’ houses of those
who were counted individually, in the number of names by their polls,
who did the work for the service of the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s house, from twenty years old and upward.
<span class="bibleverse">25</span> For David said, “The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, has given rest to his
people; and he dwells in Jerusalem forever. <span
class="bibleverse">26</span> Also the Levites will no longer need to
carry the tabernacle and all its vessels for its service.” <span
class="bibleverse">27</span> For by the last words of David the sons of
Levi were counted, from twenty years old and upward. <span
class="bibleverse">28</span> For their duty was to wait on the sons of
Aaron for the service of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s
house—in the courts, in the rooms, and in the purifying of all holy
things, even the work of the service of God’s house; <span
class="bibleverse">29</span> for the show bread also, and for the fine
flour for a meal offering, whether of unleavened wafers, or of that
which is baked in the pan, or of that which is soaked, and for all
measurements of quantity and size; <span class="bibleverse">30</span>
and to stand every morning to thank and praise the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and likewise in the evening; <span
class="bibleverse">31</span> and to offer all burnt offerings to the
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> on the Sabbaths, on the new moons,
and on the set feasts, in number according to the ordinance concerning
them, continually before the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>; <span
class="bibleverse">32</span> and that they should keep the duty of the
Tent of Meeting, the duty of the holy place, and the duty of the sons of
Aaron their brothers for the service of the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s house.</p>
<h1 id="section-23">24</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> These were the divisions of the
sons of Aaron. The sons of Aaron: Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
<span class="bibleverse">2</span> But Nadab and Abihu died before their
father, and had no children; therefore Eleazar and Ithamar served as
priests. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> David, with Zadok of the sons
of Eleazar and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, divided them according
to their ordering in their service. <span class="bibleverse">4</span>
There were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons
of Ithamar; and they were divided like this: of the sons of Eleazar
there were sixteen, heads of fathers’ houses; and of the sons of
Ithamar, according to their fathers’ houses, eight. <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> Thus they were divided impartially by
drawing lots; for there were princes of the sanctuary and princes of
God, both of the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> Shemaiah the son of Nethanel the scribe, who
was of the Levites, wrote them in the presence of the king, the princes,
Zadok the priest, Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and the heads of the
fathers’ households of the priests and of the Levites; one fathers’
house being taken for Eleazar, and one taken for Ithamar.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">7</span> Now the first lot came out to
Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah, <span class="bibleverse">8</span> the
third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim, <span class="bibleverse">9</span>
the fifth to Malchijah, the sixth to Mijamin, <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> the seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to
Abijah, <span class="bibleverse">11</span> the ninth to Jeshua, the
tenth to Shecaniah, <span class="bibleverse">12</span> the eleventh to
Eliashib, the twelfth to Jakim, <span class="bibleverse">13</span> the
thirteenth to Huppah, the fourteenth to Jeshebeab, <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> the fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth to
Immer, <span class="bibleverse">15</span> the seventeenth to Hezir, the
eighteenth to Happizzez, <span class="bibleverse">16</span> the
nineteenth to Pethahiah, the twentieth to Jehezkel, <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> the twenty-first to Jachin, the
twenty-second to Gamul, <span class="bibleverse">18</span> the
twenty-third to Delaiah, and the twenty-fourth to Maaziah. <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> This was their ordering in their service,
to come into the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s house according
to the ordinance given to them by Aaron their father, as the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, had commanded him.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">20</span> Of the rest of the sons of Levi:
of the sons of Amram, Shubael; of the sons of Shubael, Jehdeiah. <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> Of Rehabiah: of the sons of Rehabiah,
Isshiah the chief. <span class="bibleverse">22</span> Of the Izharites,
Shelomoth; of the sons of Shelomoth, Jahath. <span
class="bibleverse">23</span> The sons of Hebron: Jeriah, Amariah the
second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth. <span
class="bibleverse">24</span> The sons of Uzziel: Micah; of the sons of
Micah, Shamir. <span class="bibleverse">25</span> The brother of Micah:
Isshiah; of the sons of Isshiah, Zechariah. <span
class="bibleverse">26</span> The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. The
son of Jaaziah: Beno. <span class="bibleverse">27</span> The sons of
Merari by Jaaziah: Beno, Shoham, Zaccur, and Ibri. <span
class="bibleverse">28</span> Of Mahli: Eleazar, who had no sons. <span
class="bibleverse">29</span> Of Kish, the son of Kish: Jerahmeel. <span
class="bibleverse">30</span> The sons of Mushi: Mahli, Eder, and
Jerimoth. These were the sons of the Levites after their fathers’
houses. <span class="bibleverse">31</span> These likewise cast lots even
as their brothers the sons of Aaron in the presence of David the king,
Zadok, Ahimelech, and the heads of the fathers’ households of the
priests and of the Levites, the fathers’ households of the chief even as
those of his younger brother.</p>
<h1 id="section-24">25</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Moreover, David and the captains of
the army set apart for the service certain of the sons of Asaph, of
Heman, and of Jeduthun, who were to prophesy with harps, with stringed
instruments, and with cymbals. The number of those who did the work
according to their service was: <span class="bibleverse">2</span> of the
sons of Asaph: Zaccur, Joseph, Nethaniah, and Asharelah. The sons of
Asaph were under the hand of Asaph, who prophesied at the order of the
king. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> Of Jeduthun, the sons of
Jeduthun: Gedaliah, Zeri, Jeshaiah, Shimei, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah,
six, under the hands of their father Jeduthun, who prophesied in giving
thanks and praising the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> with the
harp. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> Of Heman, the sons of Heman:
Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel, Shebuel, Jerimoth, Hananiah, Hanani,
Eliathah, Giddalti, Romamti-Ezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir, and
Mahazioth. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> All these were the sons of
Heman the king’s seer in the words of God, to lift up the horn. God gave
to Heman fourteen sons and three daughters. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> All these were under the hands of their
father for song in the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s house, with
cymbals, stringed instruments, and harps, for the service of God’s
house: Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman being under the order of the king.
<span class="bibleverse">7</span> The number of them, with their
brothers who were instructed in singing to the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, even all who were skilful, was two
hundred and eighty-eight. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> They cast
lots for their offices, all alike, the small as well as the great, the
teacher as well as the student.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">9</span> Now the first lot came out for
Asaph to Joseph; the second to Gedaliah, he and his brothers and sons
were twelve; <span class="bibleverse">10</span> the third to Zaccur, his
sons and his brothers, twelve; <span class="bibleverse">11</span> the
fourth to Izri, his sons and his brothers, twelve; <span

<h1 id="section-25">26</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> For the divisions of the
doorkeepers: of the Korahites, Meshelemiah the son of Kore, of the sons
of Asaph. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> Meshelemiah had sons:
Zechariah the firstborn, Jediael the second, Zebadiah the third,
Jathniel the fourth, <span class="bibleverse">3</span> Elam the fifth,
Jehohanan the sixth, and Eliehoenai the seventh. <span

Jehozabad the second, Joah the third, Sacar the fourth, Nethanel the
fifth, <span class="bibleverse">5</span> Ammiel the sixth, Issachar the
seventh, and Peullethai the eighth; for God blessed him. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> Sons were also born to Shemaiah his son, who
ruled over the house of their father; for they were mighty men of
valour. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> The sons of Shemaiah: Othni,
Rephael, Obed, and Elzabad, whose relatives were valiant men, Elihu, and
Semachiah. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> All these were of the sons
of Obed-Edom with their sons and their brothers, able men in strength
for the service: sixty-two of Obed-Edom. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> Meshelemiah had sons and brothers, eighteen
valiant men. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> Also Hosah, of the
children of Merari, had sons: Shimri the chief (for though he was not
the firstborn, yet his father made him chief), <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> Hilkiah the second, Tebaliah the third, and
Zechariah the fourth. All the sons and brothers of Hosah were
thirteen.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">12</span> Of these were the divisions of the
doorkeepers, even of the chief men, having offices like their brothers,
to minister in the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s house. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> They cast lots, the small as well as the
great, according to their fathers’ houses, for every gate. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> The lot eastward fell to Shelemiah. Then
for Zechariah his son, a wise counsellor, they cast lots; and his lot
came out northward. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> To Obed-Edom
southward; and to his sons the storehouse. <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> To Shuppim and Hosah westward, by the gate
of Shallecheth, at the causeway that goes up, watchman opposite
watchman. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> Eastward were six Levites,
northward four a day, southward four a day, and for the storehouse two
and two. <span class="bibleverse">18</span> For Parbar westward, four at
the causeway, and two at Parbar. <span class="bibleverse">19</span>
These were the divisions of the doorkeepers; of the sons of the
Korahites, and of the sons of Merari.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">20</span> Of the Levites, Ahijah was over

His brothers: of Eliezer, Rehabiah his son, and Jeshaiah his son, and
Joram his son, and Zichri his son, and Shelomoth his son. <span
class="bibleverse">26</span> This Shelomoth and his brothers were over
all the treasuries of the dedicated things, which David the king, and
the heads of the fathers’ households, the captains over thousands and
hundreds, and the captains of the army, had dedicated. <span
class="bibleverse">27</span> They dedicated some of the plunder won in
battles to repair the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s house. <span
class="bibleverse">28</span> All that Samuel the seer, Saul the son of

whoever had dedicated anything, it was under the hand of Shelomoth and

<p><span class="bibleverse">29</span> Of the Izharites, Chenaniah and

Hebronites, Hashabiah and his brothers, one thousand and seven hundred
men of valour, had the oversight of Israel beyond the Jordan westward,
for all the business of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> and for
the service of the king. <span class="bibleverse">31</span> Of the
Hebronites, Jerijah was the chief of the Hebronites, according to their
generations by fathers’ households. They were sought for in the fortieth
year of the reign of David, and mighty men of valour were found amongst
them at Jazer of Gilead. <span class="bibleverse">32</span> His
relatives, men of valour, were two thousand and seven hundred, heads of
fathers’ households, whom king David made overseers over the Reubenites,
the Gadites, and the half-tribe of the Manassites, for every matter
pertaining to God and for the affairs of the king.</p>
<h1 id="section-26">27</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Now the children of Israel after
their number, the heads of fathers’ households and the captains of
thousands and of hundreds, and their officers who served the king in any
matter of the divisions which came in and went out month by month
throughout all the months of the year—of every division were twenty-four
thousand.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">2</span> Over the first division for the
first month was Jashobeam the son of Zabdiel. In his division were
twenty-four thousand. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> He was of the
children of Perez, the chief of all the captains of the army for the
first month. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> Over the division of the
second month was Dodai the Ahohite and his division, and Mikloth the
ruler; and in his division were twenty-four thousand. <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> The third captain of the army for the third
month was Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada the chief priest. In his division
were twenty-four thousand. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> This is
that Benaiah who was the mighty man of the thirty and over the thirty.
Of his division was Ammizabad his son. <span class="bibleverse">7</span>
The fourth captain for the fourth month was Asahel the brother of Joab,
and Zebadiah his son after him. In his division were twenty-four
thousand. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> The fifth captain for the
fifth month was Shamhuth the Izrahite. In his division were twenty-four
thousand. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> The sixth captain for the
sixth month was Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite. In his division were
twenty-four thousand. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> The seventh
captain for the seventh month was Helez the Pelonite, of the children of
Ephraim. In his division were twenty-four thousand. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> The eighth captain for the eighth month was
Sibbecai the Hushathite, of the Zerahites. In his division were
twenty-four thousand. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> The ninth
captain for the ninth month was Abiezer the Anathothite, of the
Benjamites. In his division were twenty-four thousand. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> The tenth captain for the tenth month was
Maharai the Netophathite, of the Zerahites. In his division were
twenty-four thousand. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> The eleventh
captain for the eleventh month was Benaiah the Pirathonite, of the
children of Ephraim. In his division were twenty-four thousand. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> The twelfth captain for the twelfth month
was Heldai the Netophathite, of Othniel. In his division were
twenty-four thousand.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">16</span> Furthermore over the tribes of
Israel: of the Reubenites, Eliezer the son of Zichri was the ruler; of
the Simeonites, Shephatiah the son of Maacah; <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> of Levi, Hashabiah the son of Kemuel; of
Aaron, Zadok; <span class="bibleverse">18</span> of Judah, Elihu, one of
the brothers of David; of Issachar, Omri the son of Michael; <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> of Zebulun, Ishmaiah the son of Obadiah; of
Naphtali, Jeremoth the son of Azriel; <span class="bibleverse">20</span>
of the children of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Azaziah; of the half-tribe
of Manasseh, Joel the son of Pedaiah; <span class="bibleverse">21</span>
of the half-tribe of Manasseh in Gilead, Iddo the son of Zechariah; of
Benjamin, Jaasiel the son of Abner; <span class="bibleverse">22</span>
of Dan, Azarel the son of Jeroham. These were the captains of the tribes
of Israel. <span class="bibleverse">23</span> But David didn’t take the
number of them from twenty years old and under, because the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> had said he would increase Israel like the
stars of the sky. <span class="bibleverse">24</span> Joab the son of
Zeruiah began to take a census, but didn’t finish; and wrath came on
Israel for this. The number wasn’t put into the account in the
chronicles of king David.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">25</span> Over the king’s treasures was
Azmaveth the son of Adiel. Over the treasures in the fields, in the
cities, in the villages, and in the towers was Jonathan the son of
Uzziah; <span class="bibleverse">26</span> Over those who did the work
of the field for tillage of the ground was Ezri the son of Chelub. <span
class="bibleverse">27</span> Over the vineyards was Shimei the
Ramathite. Over the increase of the vineyards for the wine cellars was
Zabdi the Shiphmite. <span class="bibleverse">28</span> Over the olive
trees and the sycamore trees that were in the lowland was Baal Hanan the
Gederite. Over the cellars of oil was Joash. <span
class="bibleverse">29</span> Over the herds that fed in Sharon was
Shitrai the Sharonite. Over the herds that were in the valleys was
Shaphat the son of Adlai. <span class="bibleverse">30</span> Over the
camels was Obil the Ishmaelite. Over the donkeys was Jehdeiah the
Meronothite. Over the flocks was Jaziz the Hagrite. <span
class="bibleverse">31</span> All these were the rulers of the property
which was king David’s.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">32</span> Also Jonathan, David’s uncle, was
a counsellor, a man of understanding, and a scribe. Jehiel the son of
Hachmoni was with the king’s sons. <span class="bibleverse">33</span>
Ahithophel was the king’s counsellor. Hushai the Archite was the king’s
friend. <span class="bibleverse">34</span> After Ahithophel was Jehoiada
the son of Benaiah, and Abiathar. Joab was the captain of the king’s
army.</p>
<h1 id="section-27">28</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> David assembled all the princes of
Israel, the princes of the tribes, the captains of the companies who
served the king by division, the captains of thousands, the captains of
hundreds, and the rulers over all the substance and possessions of the
king and of his sons, with the officers and the mighty men, even all the
mighty men of valour, to Jerusalem. <span class="bibleverse">2</span>
Then David the king stood up on his feet and said, “Hear me, my brothers
and my people! As for me, it was in my heart to build a house of rest
for the ark of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s covenant, and
for the footstool of our God; and I had prepared for the building. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> But God said to me, ‘You shall not build a
house for my name, because you are a man of war and have shed blood.’
<span class="bibleverse">4</span> However the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, chose me out of all
the house of my father to be king over Israel forever. For he has chosen
Judah to be prince; and in the house of Judah, the house of my father;
and amongst the sons of my father he took pleasure in me to make me king
over all Israel. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> Of all my sons (for
the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> has given me many sons), he has
chosen Solomon my son to sit on the throne of the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s kingdom over Israel. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> He said to me, ‘Solomon, your son, shall
build my house and my courts; for I have chosen him to be my son, and I
will be his father. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> I will establish
his kingdom forever if he continues to do my commandments and my
ordinances, as it is today.’</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">8</span> Now therefore, in the sight of all
Israel, the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s assembly, and in the
audience of our God, observe and seek out all the commandments of the
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> your God, that you may possess this
good land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children after you
forever.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">9</span> You, Solomon my son, know the God
of your father, and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing
mind; for the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> searches all hearts,
and understands all the imaginations of the thoughts. If you seek him,
he will be found by you; but if you forsake him, he will cast you off
forever. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> Take heed now, for the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> has chosen you to build a house for the
sanctuary. Be strong, and do it.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">11</span> Then David gave to Solomon his son
the plans for the porch of the temple, for its houses, for its
treasuries, for its upper rooms, for its inner rooms, for the place of
the mercy seat; <span class="bibleverse">12</span> and the plans of all
that he had by the Spirit, for the courts of the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s house, for all the surrounding rooms,
for the treasuries of God’s house, and for the treasuries of the
dedicated things; <span class="bibleverse">13</span> also for the
divisions of the priests and the Levites, for all the work of the
service of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s house, and for all
the vessels of service in the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s
house— <span class="bibleverse">14</span> of gold by weight for the gold
for all vessels of every kind of service, for all the vessels of silver
by weight, for all vessels of every kind of service; <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> by weight also for the lamp stands of gold,
and for its lamps, of gold, by weight for every lamp stand and for its
lamps; and for the lamp stands of silver, by weight for every lamp stand
and for its lamps, according to the use of every lamp stand; <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> and the gold by weight for the tables of
show bread, for every table; and silver for the tables of silver; <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> and the forks, the basins, and the cups, of
pure gold; and for the golden bowls by weight for every bowl; and for
the silver bowls by weight for every bowl; <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> and for the altar of incense, refined gold
by weight; and gold for the plans for the chariot, and the cherubim that
spread out and cover the ark of the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s covenant. <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> “All this”, David said, “I have been made
to understand in writing from the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s
hand, even all the works of this pattern.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">20</span> David said to Solomon his son, “Be
strong and courageous, and do it. Don’t be afraid, nor be dismayed, for
the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> God, even my God, is with you.
He will not fail you nor forsake you, until all the work for the service
of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s house is finished. <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> Behold, there are the divisions of the
priests and the Levites for all the service of God’s house. Every
willing man who has skill for any kind of service shall be with you in
all kinds of work. Also the captains and all the people will be entirely
at your command.”</p>
<h1 id="section-28">29</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> David the king said to all the
assembly, “Solomon my son, whom alone God has chosen, is yet young and
tender, and the work is great; for the palace is not for man, but for
the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> God. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> Now I have prepared with all my might for
the house of my God the gold for the things of gold, the silver for the
things of silver, the bronze for the things of bronze, iron for the
things of iron, and wood for the things of wood, also onyx stones,
stones to be set, stones for inlaid work of various colours, all kinds
of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> In addition, because I have set my affection
on the house of my God, since I have a treasure of my own of gold and
silver, I give it to the house of my God, over and above all that I have
prepared for the holy house: <span class="bibleverse">4</span> even
three thousand talents of gold,<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> of the gold of Ophir,
and seven thousand talents<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> of refined silver,
with which to overlay the walls of the houses; <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> of gold for the things of gold, and of
silver for the things of silver, and for all kinds of work to be made by
the hands of artisans. Who then offers willingly to consecrate himself
today to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">6</span> Then the princes of the fathers’
households, and the princes of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of
thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers over the king’s work, offered
willingly; <span class="bibleverse">7</span> and they gave for the
service of God’s house of gold five thousand talents<a href="#fn18"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a>
and ten thousand darics,<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> of silver ten thousand
talents, of bronze eighteen thousand talents, and of iron one hundred
thousand talents. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> People with whom
precious stones were found gave them to the treasure of the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s house, under the hand of Jehiel the
Gershonite. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> Then the people rejoiced,
because they offered willingly, because with a perfect heart they
offered willingly to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>; and David
the king also rejoiced with great joy.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">10</span> Therefore David blessed the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> before all the assembly; and David said,
“You are blessed, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel
our father, forever and ever. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> Yours,
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, is the greatness, the power, the
glory, the victory, and the majesty! For all that is in the heavens and
in the earth is yours. Yours is the kingdom, <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and you are exalted as head above all.
<span class="bibleverse">12</span> Both riches and honour come from you,
and you rule over all! In your hand is power and might! It is in your
hand to make great, and to give strength to all! <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> Now therefore, our God, we thank you and
praise your glorious name. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> But who am
I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly
as this? For all things come from you, and we have given you of your
own. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> For we are strangers before you
and foreigners, as all our fathers were. Our days on the earth are as a
shadow, and there is no remaining. <span class="bibleverse">16</span>
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> our God, all this store that we have
prepared to build you a house for your holy name comes from your hand,
and is all your own. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> I know also, my
God, that you try the heart and have pleasure in uprightness. As for me,
in the uprightness of my heart I have willingly offered all these
things. Now I have seen with joy your people, who are present here,
offer willingly to you. <span class="bibleverse">18</span> <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of
Israel, our fathers, keep this desire forever in the thoughts of the
heart of your people, and prepare their heart for you; <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> and give to Solomon my son a perfect heart,
to keep your commandments, your testimonies, and your statutes, and to
do all these things, and to build the palace, for which I have made
provision.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">20</span> Then David said to all the
assembly, “Now bless the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> your
God!”</p>
<p>All the assembly blessed the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the
God of their fathers, and bowed down their heads and prostrated
themselves before the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> and the king.
<span class="bibleverse">21</span> They sacrificed sacrifices to the
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> and offered burnt offerings to the
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> on the next day after that day, even
one thousand bulls, one thousand rams, and one thousand lambs, with
their drink offerings and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel, <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> and ate and drank before the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> on that day with great gladness. They made
Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed him before
the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> to be prince, and Zadok to be
priest.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">23</span> Then Solomon sat on the throne of
the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> as king instead of David his
father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him. <span
class="bibleverse">24</span> All the princes, the mighty men, and also
all of the sons of king David submitted themselves to Solomon the king.
<span class="bibleverse">25</span> The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight
of all Israel, and gave to him such royal majesty as had not been on any
king before him in Israel.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">26</span> Now David the son of Jesse reigned
over all Israel. <span class="bibleverse">27</span> The time that he
reigned over Israel was forty years; he reigned seven years in Hebron,
and he reigned thirty-three years in Jerusalem. <span
class="bibleverse">28</span> He died at a good old age, full of days,
riches, and honour; and Solomon his son reigned in his place. <span
class="bibleverse">29</span> Now the acts of David the king, first and
last, behold, they are written in the history of Samuel the seer, and in
the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the history of Gad the seer,
<span class="bibleverse">30</span> with all his reign and his might, and
the events that involved him, Israel, and all the kingdoms of the
lands.</p>
