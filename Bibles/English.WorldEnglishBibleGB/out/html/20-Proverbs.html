<span class="bibleverse">3</span> Do this now, my son, and deliver

class="bibleverse">25</span> Don’t lust after her beauty in your heart,
neither let her captivate you with her eyelids. <span

bread. The adulteress hunts for your precious life. <span
class="bibleverse">27</span> Can a man scoop fire into his lap, and his
clothes not be burnt? <span class="bibleverse">28</span> Or can one walk
on hot coals, and his feet not be scorched? <span
class="bibleverse">29</span> So is he who goes in to his neighbour’s
wife. Whoever touches her will not be unpunished. <span
class="bibleverse">30</span> Men don’t despise a thief if he steals to
satisfy himself when he is hungry, <span class="bibleverse">31</span>
but if he is found, he shall restore seven times. He shall give all the
wealth of his house. <span class="bibleverse">32</span> He who commits
adultery with a woman is void of understanding. He who does it destroys
his own soul. <span class="bibleverse">33</span> He will get wounds and
dishonour. His reproach will not be wiped away. <span
class="bibleverse">34</span> For jealousy arouses the fury of the
husband. He won’t spare in the day of vengeance. <span

rest content, though you give many gifts.</p>

righteousness delivers from death. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> The
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> will not allow the soul of the
righteous to go hungry, but he thrusts away the desire of the wicked.
<span class="bibleverse">4</span> He becomes poor who works with a lazy
hand, but the hand of the diligent brings wealth. <span

he who sleeps during the harvest is a son who causes shame. <span

the name of the wicked will rot. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> The
wise in heart accept commandments, but a chattering fool will fall.
<span class="bibleverse">9</span> He who walks blamelessly walks surely,

mouth of the righteous is a spring of life, but violence covers the
mouth of the wicked. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> Hatred stirs up
strife, but love covers all wrongs. <span class="bibleverse">13</span>
Wisdom is found on the lips of him who has discernment, but a rod is for
the back of him who is void of understanding. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> Wise men lay up knowledge, but the mouth of
the foolish is near ruin. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> The rich
man’s wealth is his strong city. The destruction of the poor is their
poverty. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> The labour of the righteous
leads to life. The increase of the wicked leads to sin. <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> He is in the way of life who heeds
correction, but he who forsakes reproof leads others astray. <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> He who hides hatred has lying lips. He who
utters a slander is a fool. <span class="bibleverse">19</span> In the
multitude of words there is no lack of disobedience, but he who

Riches don’t profit in the day of wrath, but righteousness delivers from

The words of the wicked are about lying in wait for blood, but the
speech of the upright rescues them. <span class="bibleverse">7</span>
The wicked are overthrown, and are no more, but the house of the

<span class="bibleverse">10</span> A righteous man respects the life of

fruit of his mouth. The work of a man’s hands shall be rewarded to him.
<span class="bibleverse">15</span> The way of a fool is right in his own

class="bibleverse">16</span> A fool shows his annoyance the same day,
but one who overlooks an insult is prudent. <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> He who is truthful testifies honestly, but
a false witness lies. <span class="bibleverse">18</span> There is one
who speaks rashly like the piercing of a sword, but the tongue of the
wise heals. <span class="bibleverse">19</span> Truth’s lips will be

evil, but joy comes to the promoters of peace. <span

but the wicked shall be filled with evil. <span

delight. <span class="bibleverse">23</span> A prudent man keeps his
knowledge, but the hearts of fools proclaim foolishness. <span
class="bibleverse">24</span> The hands of the diligent ones shall rule,
but laziness ends in slave labour. <span class="bibleverse">25</span>
Anxiety in a man’s heart weighs it down, but a kind word makes it glad.
<span class="bibleverse">26</span> A righteous person is cautious in
friendship, but the way of the wicked leads them astray. <span
class="bibleverse">27</span> The slothful man doesn’t roast his game,
but the possessions of diligent men are prized. <span

path there is no death.</p>
<h1 id="section-12">13</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> A wise son listens to his father’s
instruction, but a scoffer doesn’t listen to rebuke. <span

things, but the unfaithful crave violence. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> He who guards his mouth guards his soul. One
who opens wide his lips comes to ruin. <span class="bibleverse">4</span>
The soul of the sluggard desires, and has nothing, but the desire of the
diligent shall be fully satisfied. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> A
righteous man hates lies, but a wicked man brings shame and disgrace.
<span class="bibleverse">6</span> Righteousness guards the way of
integrity, but wickedness overthrows the sinner. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> There are some who pretend to be rich, yet
have nothing. There are some who pretend to be poor, yet have great
wealth. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> The ransom of a man’s life is
his riches, but the poor hear no threats. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> The light of the righteous shines brightly,
but the lamp of the wicked is snuffed out. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> Pride only breeds quarrels, but wisdom is
with people who take advice. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> Wealth
gained dishonestly dwindles away, but he who gathers by hand makes it
grow. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> Hope deferred makes the heart
sick, but when longing is fulfilled, it is a tree of life. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> Whoever despises instruction will pay for
it, but he who respects a command will be rewarded. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> The teaching of the wise is a spring of
life, to turn from the snares of death. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> Good understanding wins favour, but the way
of the unfaithful is hard. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> Every
prudent man acts from knowledge, but a fool exposes folly. <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> A wicked messenger falls into trouble, but
a trustworthy envoy gains healing. <span class="bibleverse">18</span>
Poverty and shame come to him who refuses discipline, but he who heeds
correction shall be honoured. <span class="bibleverse">19</span> Longing
fulfilled is sweet to the soul, but fools detest turning from evil.
<span class="bibleverse">20</span> One who walks with wise men grows
wise, but a companion of fools suffers harm. <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> Misfortune pursues sinners, but prosperity
rewards the righteous. <span class="bibleverse">22</span> A good man
leaves an inheritance to his children’s children, but the wealth of the
sinner is stored for the righteous. <span class="bibleverse">23</span>
An abundance of food is in poor people’s fields, but injustice sweeps it
away. <span class="bibleverse">24</span> One who spares the rod hates
his son, but one who loves him is careful to discipline him. <span
class="bibleverse">25</span> The righteous one eats to the satisfying of
his soul, but the belly of the wicked goes hungry.</p>
<h1 id="section-13">14</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Every wise woman builds her house,
but the foolish one tears it down with her own hands. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> He who walks in his uprightness fears the
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, but he who is perverse in his ways
despises him. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> The fool’s talk brings a
rod to his back, but the lips of the wise protect them. <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> Where no oxen are, the crib is clean, but
much increase is by the strength of the ox. <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> A truthful witness will not lie, but a false
witness pours out lies. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> A scoffer
seeks wisdom, and doesn’t find it, but knowledge comes easily to a
discerning person. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> Stay away from a
foolish man, for you won’t find knowledge on his lips. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> The wisdom of the prudent is to think about
his way, but the folly of fools is deceit. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> Fools mock at making atonement for sins, but
amongst the upright there is good will. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> The heart knows its own bitterness and joy;
he will not share these with a stranger. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> The house of the wicked will be overthrown,
but the tent of the upright will flourish. <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> There is a way which seems right to a man,
but in the end it leads to death. <span class="bibleverse">13</span>
Even in laughter the heart may be sorrowful, and mirth may end in
heaviness. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> The unfaithful will be
repaid for his own ways; likewise a good man will be rewarded for his
ways. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> A simple man believes
everything, but the prudent man carefully considers his ways. <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> A wise man fears and shuns evil, but the
fool is hot headed and reckless. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> He
who is quick to become angry will commit folly, and a crafty man is
hated. <span class="bibleverse">18</span> The simple inherit folly, but
the prudent are crowned with knowledge. <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> The evil bow down before the good, and the
wicked at the gates of the righteous. <span class="bibleverse">20</span>
The poor person is shunned even by his own neighbour, but the rich
person has many friends. <span class="bibleverse">21</span> He who
despises his neighbour sins, but he who has pity on the poor is blessed.
<span class="bibleverse">22</span> Don’t they go astray who plot evil?
But love and faithfulness belong to those who plan good. <span
class="bibleverse">23</span> In all hard work there is profit, but the
talk of the lips leads only to poverty. <span
class="bibleverse">24</span> The crown of the wise is their riches, but
the folly of fools crowns them with folly. <span
class="bibleverse">25</span> A truthful witness saves souls, but a false
witness is deceitful. <span class="bibleverse">26</span> In the fear of
the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is a secure fortress, and he
will be a refuge for his children. <span class="bibleverse">27</span>
The fear of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is a fountain of
life, turning people from the snares of death. <span
class="bibleverse">28</span> In the multitude of people is the king’s
glory, but in the lack of people is the destruction of the prince. <span
class="bibleverse">29</span> He who is slow to anger has great
understanding, but he who has a quick temper displays folly. <span
class="bibleverse">30</span> The life of the body is a heart at peace,
but envy rots the bones. <span class="bibleverse">31</span> He who
oppresses the poor shows contempt for his Maker, but he who is kind to
the needy honours him. <span class="bibleverse">32</span> The wicked is
brought down in his calamity, but in death, the righteous has a refuge.
<span class="bibleverse">33</span> Wisdom rests in the heart of one who
has understanding, and is even made known in the inward part of fools.
<span class="bibleverse">34</span> Righteousness exalts a nation, but
sin is a disgrace to any people. <span class="bibleverse">35</span> The
king’s favour is towards a servant who deals wisely, but his wrath is
towards one who causes shame.</p>
<h1 id="section-14">15</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> A gentle answer turns away wrath,
but a harsh word stirs up anger. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> The
tongue of the wise commends knowledge, but the mouths of fools gush out
folly. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> The <span

the evil and the good. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> A gentle tongue
is a tree of life, but deceit in it crushes the spirit. <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> A fool despises his father’s correction, but
he who heeds reproof shows prudence. <span class="bibleverse">6</span>
In the house of the righteous is much treasure, but the income of the

wise spread knowledge; not so with the heart of fools. <span

class="bibleverse">12</span> A scoffer doesn’t love to be reproved; he
will not go to the wise. <span class="bibleverse">13</span> A glad heart
makes a cheerful face, but an aching heart breaks the spirit. <span

seeks knowledge, but the mouths of fools feed on folly. <span

but one who has a cheerful heart enjoys a continual feast. <span

<span class="bibleverse">17</span> Better is a dinner of herbs, where
love is, than a fattened calf with hatred. <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> A wrathful man stirs up contention, but one
who is slow to anger appeases strife. <span class="bibleverse">19</span>
The way of the sluggard is like a thorn patch, but the path of the
upright is a highway. <span class="bibleverse">20</span> A wise son
makes a father glad, but a foolish man despises his mother. <span

mouth. How good is a word at the right time! <span

<span class="bibleverse">25</span> The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> will uproot the house of the proud, but he
will keep the widow’s borders intact. <span class="bibleverse">26</span>
The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> detests the thoughts of the
wicked, but the thoughts of the pure are pleasing. <span
class="bibleverse">27</span> He who is greedy for gain troubles his own
house, but he who hates bribes will live. <span
class="bibleverse">28</span> The heart of the righteous weighs answers,
but the mouth of the wicked gushes out evil. <span
class="bibleverse">29</span> The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is
far from the wicked, but he hears the prayer of the righteous. <span
class="bibleverse">30</span> The light of the eyes rejoices the heart.
Good news gives health to the bones. <span class="bibleverse">31</span>
The ear that listens to reproof lives, and will be at home amongst the
wise. <span class="bibleverse">32</span> He who refuses correction
despises his own soul, but he who listens to reproof gets understanding.
<span class="bibleverse">33</span> The fear of the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> teaches wisdom. Before honour is
humility.</p>
<h1 id="section-15">16</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> The plans of the heart belong to
man, but the answer of the tongue is from the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> All the
ways of a man are clean in his own eyes, but the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> weighs the motives. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> Commit your deeds to the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and your plans shall succeed. <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> has
made everything for its own end— yes, even the wicked for the day of
evil. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> Everyone who is proud in heart
is an abomination to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>; they shall
certainly not be unpunished. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> By mercy
and truth iniquity is atoned for. By the fear of the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> men depart from evil. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> When a man’s ways please the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, he makes even his enemies to be at peace
with him. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> Better is a little with
righteousness, than great revenues with injustice. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> A man’s heart plans his course, but the
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> directs his steps. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> Inspired judgements are on the lips of the
king. He shall not betray his mouth. <span class="bibleverse">11</span>
Honest balances and scales are the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s; all the weights in the bag are his
work. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> It is an abomination for kings
to do wrong, for the throne is established by righteousness. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> Righteous lips are the delight of kings.
They value one who speaks the truth. <span class="bibleverse">14</span>
The king’s wrath is a messenger of death, but a wise man will pacify it.
<span class="bibleverse">15</span> In the light of the king’s face is
life. His favour is like a cloud of the spring rain. <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> How much better it is to get wisdom than
gold! Yes, to get understanding is to be chosen rather than silver.
<span class="bibleverse">17</span> The highway of the upright is to
depart from evil. He who keeps his way preserves his soul. <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> Pride goes before destruction, and an
arrogant spirit before a fall. <span class="bibleverse">19</span> It is
better to be of a lowly spirit with the poor, than to divide the plunder
with the proud. <span class="bibleverse">20</span> He who heeds the Word
finds prosperity. Whoever trusts in the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is blessed. <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> The wise in heart shall be called prudent.
Pleasantness of the lips promotes instruction. <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> Understanding is a fountain of life to one
who has it, but the punishment of fools is their folly. <span
class="bibleverse">23</span> The heart of the wise instructs his mouth,
and adds learning to his lips. <span class="bibleverse">24</span>
Pleasant words are a honeycomb, sweet to the soul, and health to the
bones. <span class="bibleverse">25</span> There is a way which seems
right to a man, but in the end it leads to death. <span
class="bibleverse">26</span> The appetite of the labouring man labours
for him, for his mouth urges him on. <span class="bibleverse">27</span>
A worthless man devises mischief. His speech is like a scorching fire.
<span class="bibleverse">28</span> A perverse man stirs up strife. A
whisperer separates close friends. <span class="bibleverse">29</span> A
man of violence entices his neighbour, and leads him in a way that is
not good. <span class="bibleverse">30</span> One who winks his eyes to
plot perversities, one who compresses his lips, is bent on evil. <span
class="bibleverse">31</span> Grey hair is a crown of glory. It is
attained by a life of righteousness. <span class="bibleverse">32</span>
One who is slow to anger is better than the mighty; one who rules his
spirit, than he who takes a city. <span class="bibleverse">33</span> The
lot is cast into the lap, but its every decision is from the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>.</p>
<h1 id="section-16">17</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Better is a dry morsel with
quietness, than a house full of feasting with strife. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> A servant who deals wisely will rule over a
son who causes shame, and shall have a part in the inheritance amongst
the brothers. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> The refining pot is for
silver, and the furnace for gold, but the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> tests the hearts. <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> An evildoer heeds wicked lips. A liar gives
ear to a mischievous tongue. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> Whoever
mocks the poor reproaches his Maker. He who is glad at calamity shall
not be unpunished. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> Children’s children
are the crown of old men; the glory of children is their parents. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> Excellent speech isn’t fitting for a fool,
much less do lying lips fit a prince. <span class="bibleverse">8</span>
A bribe is a precious stone in the eyes of him who gives it; wherever he
turns, he prospers. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> He who covers an
offence promotes love; but he who repeats a matter separates best
friends. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> A rebuke enters deeper into
one who has understanding than a hundred lashes into a fool. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> An evil man seeks only rebellion; therefore
a cruel messenger shall be sent against him. <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> Let a bear robbed of her cubs meet a man,
rather than a fool in his folly. <span class="bibleverse">13</span>
Whoever rewards evil for good, evil shall not depart from his house.
<span class="bibleverse">14</span> The beginning of strife is like
breaching a dam, therefore stop contention before quarrelling breaks
out. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> He who justifies the wicked, and
he who condemns the righteous, both of them alike are an abomination to
the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> Why is there money in the hand of a fool to
buy wisdom, since he has no understanding? <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> A friend loves at all times; and a brother
is born for adversity. <span class="bibleverse">18</span> A man void of
understanding strikes hands, and becomes collateral in the presence of
his neighbour. <span class="bibleverse">19</span> He who loves
disobedience loves strife. One who builds a high gate seeks destruction.
<span class="bibleverse">20</span> One who has a perverse heart doesn’t
find prosperity, and one who has a deceitful tongue falls into trouble.
<span class="bibleverse">21</span> He who becomes the father of a fool
grieves. The father of a fool has no joy. <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> A cheerful heart makes good medicine, but a
crushed spirit dries up the bones. <span class="bibleverse">23</span> A
wicked man receives a bribe in secret, to pervert the ways of justice.
<span class="bibleverse">24</span> Wisdom is before the face of one who
has understanding, but the eyes of a fool wander to the ends of the
earth. <span class="bibleverse">25</span> A foolish son brings grief to
his father, and bitterness to her who bore him. <span
class="bibleverse">26</span> Also to punish the righteous is not good,
nor to flog officials for their integrity. <span
class="bibleverse">27</span> He who spares his words has knowledge. He
who is even tempered is a man of understanding. <span
class="bibleverse">28</span> Even a fool, when he keeps silent, is
counted wise. When he shuts his lips, he is thought to be
discerning.</p>
<h1 id="section-17">18</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> A man who isolates himself pursues
selfishness, and defies all sound judgement. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> A fool has no delight in understanding, but
only in revealing his own opinion. <span class="bibleverse">3</span>
When wickedness comes, contempt also comes, and with shame comes
disgrace. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> The words of a man’s mouth
are like deep waters. The fountain of wisdom is like a flowing brook.
<span class="bibleverse">5</span> To be partial to the faces of the
wicked is not good, nor to deprive the innocent of justice. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> A fool’s lips come into strife, and his
mouth invites beatings. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> A fool’s mouth
is his destruction, and his lips are a snare to his soul. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> The words of a gossip are like dainty
morsels: they go down into a person’s innermost parts. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> One who is slack in his work is brother to
him who is a master of destruction. <span class="bibleverse">10</span>
The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s name is a strong tower: the
righteous run to him, and are safe. <span class="bibleverse">11</span>
The rich man’s wealth is his strong city, like an unscalable wall in his
own imagination. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> Before destruction
the heart of man is proud, but before honour is humility. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> He who answers before he hears, that is
folly and shame to him. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> A man’s
spirit will sustain him in sickness, but a crushed spirit, who can bear?
<span class="bibleverse">15</span> The heart of the discerning gets
knowledge. The ear of the wise seeks knowledge. <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> A man’s gift makes room for him, and brings
him before great men. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> He who pleads
his cause first seems right— until another comes and questions him.
<span class="bibleverse">18</span> The lot settles disputes, and keeps
strong ones apart. <span class="bibleverse">19</span> A brother offended
is more difficult than a fortified city. Disputes are like the bars of a
fortress. <span class="bibleverse">20</span> A man’s stomach is filled
with the fruit of his mouth. With the harvest of his lips he is
satisfied. <span class="bibleverse">21</span> Death and life are in the
power of the tongue; those who love it will eat its fruit. <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> Whoever finds a wife finds a good thing,
and obtains favour of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. <span
class="bibleverse">23</span> The poor plead for mercy, but the rich
answer harshly. <span class="bibleverse">24</span> A man of many
companions may be ruined, but there is a friend who sticks closer than a
brother.</p>
<h1 id="section-18">19</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Better is the poor who walks in his
integrity than he who is perverse in his lips and is a fool. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> It isn’t good to have zeal without
knowledge, nor being hasty with one’s feet and missing the way. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> The foolishness of man subverts his way; his
heart rages against the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> Wealth adds many friends, but the poor is
separated from his friend. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> A false
witness shall not be unpunished. He who pours out lies shall not go
free. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> Many will entreat the favour of
a ruler, and everyone is a friend to a man who gives gifts. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> All the relatives of the poor shun him; how
much more do his friends avoid him! He pursues them with pleas, but they
are gone. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> He who gets wisdom loves his
own soul. He who keeps understanding shall find good. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> A false witness shall not be unpunished. He
who utters lies shall perish. <span class="bibleverse">10</span>
Delicate living is not appropriate for a fool, much less for a servant
to have rule over princes. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> The
discretion of a man makes him slow to anger. It is his glory to overlook
an offence. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> The king’s wrath is like
the roaring of a lion, but his favour is like dew on the grass. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> A foolish son is the calamity of his
father. A wife’s quarrels are a continual dripping. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> House and riches are an inheritance from
fathers, but a prudent wife is from the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. <span class="bibleverse">15</span>
Slothfulness casts into a deep sleep. The idle soul shall suffer hunger.
<span class="bibleverse">16</span> He who keeps the commandment keeps
his soul, but he who is contemptuous in his ways shall die. <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> He who has pity on the poor lends to the
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>; he will reward him. <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> Discipline your son, for there is hope;
don’t be a willing party to his death. <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> A hot-tempered man must pay the penalty,
for if you rescue him, you must do it again. <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> Listen to counsel and receive instruction,
that you may be wise in your latter end. <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> There are many plans in a man’s heart, but
the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s counsel will prevail. <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> That which makes a man to be desired is his
kindness. A poor man is better than a liar. <span
class="bibleverse">23</span> The fear of the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> leads to life, then contentment; he rests
and will not be touched by trouble. <span class="bibleverse">24</span>
The sluggard buries his hand in the dish; he will not so much as bring
it to his mouth again. <span class="bibleverse">25</span> Flog a
scoffer, and the simple will learn prudence; rebuke one who has
understanding, and he will gain knowledge. <span
class="bibleverse">26</span> He who robs his father and drives away his
mother is a son who causes shame and brings reproach. <span
class="bibleverse">27</span> If you stop listening to instruction, my
son, you will stray from the words of knowledge. <span
class="bibleverse">28</span> A corrupt witness mocks justice, and the
mouth of the wicked gulps down iniquity. <span
class="bibleverse">29</span> Penalties are prepared for scoffers, and
beatings for the backs of fools.</p>
<h1 id="section-19">20</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Wine is a mocker and beer is a
brawler. Whoever is led astray by them is not wise. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> The terror of a king is like the roaring of
a lion. He who provokes him to anger forfeits his own life. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> It is an honour for a man to keep aloof from
strife, but every fool will be quarrelling. <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> The sluggard will not plough by reason of
the winter; therefore he shall beg in harvest, and have nothing. <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> Counsel in the heart of man is like deep
water, but a man of understanding will draw it out. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> Many men claim to be men of unfailing love,
but who can find a faithful man? <span class="bibleverse">7</span> A
righteous man walks in integrity. Blessed are his children after him.
<span class="bibleverse">8</span> A king who sits on the throne of
judgement scatters away all evil with his eyes. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> Who can say, “I have made my heart pure. I
am clean and without sin?” <span class="bibleverse">10</span> Differing
weights and differing measures, both of them alike are an abomination to
the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> Even a child makes himself known by his
doings, whether his work is pure, and whether it is right. <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, The
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> has made even both of them. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> Don’t love sleep, lest you come to poverty.
Open your eyes, and you shall be satisfied with bread. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> “It’s no good, it’s no good,” says the
buyer; but when he is gone his way, then he boasts. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> There is gold and abundance of rubies, but
the lips of knowledge are a rare jewel. <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> Take the garment of one who puts up
collateral for a stranger; and hold him in pledge for a wayward woman.
<span class="bibleverse">17</span> Fraudulent food is sweet to a man,
but afterwards his mouth is filled with gravel. <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> Plans are established by advice; by wise
guidance you wage war! <span class="bibleverse">19</span> He who goes
about as a tale-bearer reveals secrets; therefore don’t keep company
with him who opens wide his lips. <span class="bibleverse">20</span>
Whoever curses his father or his mother, his lamp shall be put out in
blackness of darkness. <span class="bibleverse">21</span> An inheritance
quickly gained at the beginning won’t be blessed in the end. <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> Don’t say, “I will pay back evil.” Wait for
the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and he will save you. <span
class="bibleverse">23</span> The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>
detests differing weights, and dishonest scales are not pleasing. <span
class="bibleverse">24</span> A man’s steps are from the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>; how then can man understand his way?
<span class="bibleverse">25</span> It is a snare to a man to make a rash
dedication, then later to consider his vows. <span
class="bibleverse">26</span> A wise king winnows out the wicked, and
drives the threshing wheel over them. <span class="bibleverse">27</span>
The spirit of man is the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s lamp,
searching all his innermost parts. <span class="bibleverse">28</span>
Love and faithfulness keep the king safe. His throne is sustained by
love. <span class="bibleverse">29</span> The glory of young men is their
strength. The splendour of old men is their grey hair. <span
class="bibleverse">30</span> Wounding blows cleanse away evil, and
beatings purge the innermost parts.</p>
<h1 id="section-20">21</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> The king’s heart is in the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s hand like the watercourses. He turns it
wherever he desires. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> Every way of a
man is right in his own eyes, but the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> weighs the hearts. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> To do righteousness and justice is more
acceptable to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> than sacrifice.
<span class="bibleverse">4</span> A high look and a proud heart, the
lamp of the wicked, is sin. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> The plans
of the diligent surely lead to profit; and everyone who is hasty surely
rushes to poverty. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> Getting treasures
by a lying tongue is a fleeting vapour for those who seek death. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> The violence of the wicked will drive them
away, because they refuse to do what is right. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> The way of the guilty is devious, but the
conduct of the innocent is upright. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> It
is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop than to share a house
with a contentious woman. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> The soul of
the wicked desires evil; his neighbour finds no mercy in his eyes. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> When the mocker is punished, the simple
gains wisdom. When the wise is instructed, he receives knowledge. <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> The Righteous One considers the house of
the wicked, and brings the wicked to ruin. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> Whoever stops his ears at the cry of the
poor, he will also cry out, but shall not be heard. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> A gift in secret pacifies anger, and a
bribe in the cloak, strong wrath. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> It
is joy to the righteous to do justice; but it is a destruction to the
workers of iniquity. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> The man who
wanders out of the way of understanding shall rest in the assembly of
the departed spirits. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> He who loves
pleasure will be a poor man. He who loves wine and oil won’t be rich.
<span class="bibleverse">18</span> The wicked is a ransom for the
righteous, the treacherous for the upright. <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> It is better to dwell in a desert land,
than with a contentious and fretful woman. <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> There is precious treasure and oil in the
dwelling of the wise, but a foolish man swallows it up. <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> He who follows after righteousness and
kindness finds life, righteousness, and honour. <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> A wise man scales the city of the mighty,
and brings down the strength of its confidence. <span
class="bibleverse">23</span> Whoever guards his mouth and his tongue
keeps his soul from troubles. <span class="bibleverse">24</span> The
proud and arrogant man—“Scoffer” is his name— he works in the arrogance
of pride. <span class="bibleverse">25</span> The desire of the sluggard
kills him, for his hands refuse to labour. <span
class="bibleverse">26</span> There are those who covet greedily all day
long; but the righteous give and don’t withhold. <span
class="bibleverse">27</span> The sacrifice of the wicked is an
abomination— how much more, when he brings it with a wicked mind! <span
class="bibleverse">28</span> A false witness will perish. A man who
listens speaks to eternity. <span class="bibleverse">29</span> A wicked
man hardens his face; but as for the upright, he establishes his ways.
<span class="bibleverse">30</span> There is no wisdom nor understanding
nor counsel against the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. <span
class="bibleverse">31</span> The horse is prepared for the day of
battle; but victory is with the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>.</p>
<h1 id="section-21">22</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> A good name is more desirable than
great riches, and loving favour is better than silver and gold. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> The rich and the poor have this in common:
The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is the maker of them all. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> A prudent man sees danger and hides himself;
but the simple pass on, and suffer for it. <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> The result of humility and the fear of the
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is wealth, honour, and life. <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> Thorns and snares are in the path of the
wicked; whoever guards his soul stays from them. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> Train up a child in the way he should go,
and when he is old he will not depart from it. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> The rich rule over the poor. The borrower is
servant to the lender. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> He who sows
wickedness reaps trouble, and the rod of his fury will be destroyed.
<span class="bibleverse">9</span> He who has a generous eye will be
blessed, for he shares his food with the poor. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> Drive out the mocker, and strife will go
out; yes, quarrels and insults will stop. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> He who loves purity of heart and speaks
gracefully is the king’s friend. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> The
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s eyes watch over knowledge, but he
frustrates the words of the unfaithful. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> The sluggard says, “There is a lion
outside! I will be killed in the streets!” <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> The mouth of an adulteress is a deep pit.
He who is under the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s wrath will
fall into it. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> Folly is bound up in
the heart of a child; the rod of discipline drives it far from him.
<span class="bibleverse">16</span> Whoever oppresses the poor for his
own increase and whoever gives to the rich, both come to poverty.</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">17</span> Turn your ear, and listen to the
words of the wise. Apply your heart to my teaching. <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> For it is a pleasant thing if you keep them
within you, if all of them are ready on your lips. <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> I teach you today, even you, so that your

class="bibleverse">20</span> Haven’t I written to you thirty excellent
things of counsel and knowledge, <span class="bibleverse">21</span> To
teach you truth, reliable words, to give sound answers to the ones who
sent you?</p>
<h2 id="individual-reminders">Individual Reminders</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">22</span> Don’t exploit the poor because he
is poor; and don’t crush the needy in court; <span
class="bibleverse">23</span> for the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>
will plead their case, and plunder the life of those who plunder them.
<span class="bibleverse">24</span> Don’t befriend a hot-tempered man.
Don’t associate with one who harbours anger, <span
class="bibleverse">25</span> lest you learn his ways and ensnare your
soul. <span class="bibleverse">26</span> Don’t you be one of those who
strike hands, of those who are collateral for debts. <span
class="bibleverse">27</span> If you don’t have means to pay, why should
he take away your bed from under you? <span class="bibleverse">28</span>
Don’t move the ancient boundary stone which your fathers have set up.
<span class="bibleverse">29</span> Do you see a man skilled in his work?
He will serve kings. He won’t serve obscure men.</p>
<h1 id="section-22">23</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> When you sit to eat with a ruler,
consider diligently what is before you; <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> put a knife to your throat if you are a man
given to appetite. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> Don’t be desirous
of his dainties, since they are deceitful food. <span

wisdom, show restraint. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> Why do you set
your eyes on that which is not? For it certainly sprouts wings like an
eagle and flies in the sky. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> Don’t eat
the food of him who has a stingy eye, and don’t crave his delicacies,
<span class="bibleverse">7</span> for as he thinks about the cost, so he
is. “Eat and drink!” he says to you, but his heart is not with you.
<span class="bibleverse">8</span> You will vomit up the morsel which you
have eaten and waste your pleasant words. <span

will despise the wisdom of your words. <span

Don’t encroach on the fields of the fatherless, <span

their case against you. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> Apply your

My son, if your heart is wise, then my heart will be glad, even mine.
<span class="bibleverse">16</span> Yes, my heart will rejoice when your
lips speak what is right. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> Don’t let
your heart envy sinners, but rather fear the <span

Listen, my son, and be wise, and keep your heart on the right path!
<span class="bibleverse">20</span> Don’t be amongst ones drinking too
much wine, or those who gorge themselves on meat; <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> for the drunkard and the glutton shall
become poor; and drowsiness clothes them in rags. <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> Listen to your father who gave you life,
and don’t despise your mother when she is old. <span
class="bibleverse">23</span> Buy the truth, and don’t sell it. Get
wisdom, discipline, and understanding. <span
class="bibleverse">24</span> The father of the righteous has great joy.
Whoever fathers a wise child delights in him. <span
class="bibleverse">25</span> Let your father and your mother be glad!
Let her who bore you rejoice! <span class="bibleverse">26</span> My son,
give me your heart; and let your eyes keep in my ways. <span
class="bibleverse">27</span> For a prostitute is a deep pit; and a
wayward wife is a narrow well. <span class="bibleverse">28</span> Yes,
she lies in wait like a robber, and increases the unfaithful amongst
men. <span class="bibleverse">29</span> Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who
has strife? Who has complaints? Who has needless bruises? Who has
bloodshot eyes? <span class="bibleverse">30</span> Those who stay long
at the wine; those who go to seek out mixed wine. <span
class="bibleverse">31</span> Don’t look at the wine when it is red, when
it sparkles in the cup, when it goes down smoothly. <span
class="bibleverse">32</span> In the end, it bites like a snake, and
poisons like a viper. <span class="bibleverse">33</span> Your eyes will
see strange things, and your mind will imagine confusing things. <span

me, and I don’t feel it! When will I wake up? I can do it again. I will
look for more.”</p>
<h1 id="section-23">24</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Don’t be envious of evil men,
neither desire to be with them; <span class="bibleverse">2</span> for
their hearts plot violence and their lips talk about mischief. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> Through wisdom a house is built; by
understanding it is established; <span class="bibleverse">4</span> by
knowledge the rooms are filled with all rare and beautiful treasure.
<span class="bibleverse">5</span> A wise man has great power. A
knowledgeable man increases strength, <span class="bibleverse">6</span>
for by wise guidance you wage your war, and victory is in many advisors.
<span class="bibleverse">7</span> Wisdom is too high for a fool. He
doesn’t open his mouth in the gate. <span class="bibleverse">8</span>
One who plots to do evil will be called a schemer. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> The schemes of folly are sin. The mocker is
detested by men. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> If you falter in the
time of trouble, your strength is small. <span

death! Indeed, hold back those who are staggering to the slaughter!
<span class="bibleverse">12</span> If you say, “Behold, we didn’t know
this,” doesn’t he who weighs the hearts consider it? He who keeps your
soul, doesn’t he know it? Shall he not render to every man according to
his work? <span class="bibleverse">13</span> My son, eat honey, for it
is good, the droppings of the honeycomb, which are sweet to your taste;
<span class="bibleverse">14</span> so you shall know wisdom to be to
your soul. If you have found it, then there will be a reward: Your hope
will not be cut off. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> Don’t lay in
wait, wicked man, against the habitation of the righteous. Don’t destroy
his resting place; <span class="bibleverse">16</span> for a righteous
man falls seven times and rises up again, but the wicked are overthrown
by calamity. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> Don’t rejoice when your
enemy falls. Don’t let your heart be glad when he is overthrown, <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> lest the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> see it, and it displease him, and he turn
away his wrath from him. <span class="bibleverse">19</span> Don’t fret
yourself because of evildoers, neither be envious of the wicked; <span

man. The lamp of the wicked will be snuffed out. <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> My son, fear the <span

rebellious, <span class="bibleverse">22</span> for their calamity will

<h2 id="second-collection-of-sayings-of-the-wise">Second collection of
sayings of the wise</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">23</span> These also are sayings of the
wise: To show partiality in judgement is not good. <span
class="bibleverse">24</span> He who says to the wicked, “You are
righteous,” peoples will curse him, and nations will abhor him— <span
class="bibleverse">25</span> but it will go well with those who convict
the guilty, and a rich blessing will come on them. <span
class="bibleverse">26</span> An honest answer is like a kiss on the
lips. <span class="bibleverse">27</span> Prepare your work outside, and
get your fields ready. Afterwards, build your house. <span
class="bibleverse">28</span> Don’t be a witness against your neighbour
without cause. Don’t deceive with your lips. <span
class="bibleverse">29</span> Don’t say, “I will do to him as he has done
to me; I will repay the man according to his work.” <span
class="bibleverse">30</span> I went by the field of the sluggard, by the
vineyard of the man void of understanding. <span
class="bibleverse">31</span> Behold, it was all grown over with thorns.
Its surface was covered with nettles, and its stone wall was broken
down. <span class="bibleverse">32</span> Then I saw, and considered
well. I saw, and received instruction: <span

folding of the hands to sleep, <span class="bibleverse">34</span> so
your poverty will come as a robber and your want as an armed man.</p>

<h2 id="third-collection-of-proverbs-of-solomon">Third collection of
Proverbs of Solomon</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> These also are proverbs of Solomon,
which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> It is the glory of God to conceal a thing,
but the glory of kings is to search out a matter. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> As the heavens for height, and the earth for
depth, so the hearts of kings are unsearchable. <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> Take away the dross from the silver, and
material comes out for the refiner. <span class="bibleverse">5</span>
Take away the wicked from the king’s presence, and his throne will be
established in righteousness. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> Don’t
exalt yourself in the presence of the king, or claim a place amongst
great men; <span class="bibleverse">7</span> for it is better that it be
said to you, “Come up here,” than that you should be put lower in the
presence of the prince, whom your eyes have seen. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> Don’t be hasty in bringing charges to court.
What will you do in the end when your neighbour shames you? <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> Debate your case with your neighbour, and
don’t betray the confidence of another, <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> lest one who hears it put you to shame, and
your bad reputation never depart. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> A
word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in settings of silver. <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> As an earring of gold, and an ornament of
fine gold, so is a wise reprover to an obedient ear. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> As the cold of snow in the time of harvest,
so is a faithful messenger to those who send him; for he refreshes the
soul of his masters. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> As clouds and
wind without rain, so is he who boasts of gifts deceptively. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> By patience a ruler is persuaded. A soft
tongue breaks the bone. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> Have you
found honey? Eat as much as is sufficient for you, lest you eat too
much, and vomit it. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> Let your foot be
seldom in your neighbour’s house, lest he be weary of you, and hate you.
<span class="bibleverse">18</span> A man who gives false testimony
against his neighbour is like a club, a sword, or a sharp arrow. <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> Confidence in someone unfaithful in time of
trouble is like a bad tooth or a lame foot. <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> As one who takes away a garment in cold
weather, or vinegar on soda, so is one who sings songs to a heavy heart.
<span class="bibleverse">21</span> If your enemy is hungry, give him
food to eat. If he is thirsty, give him water to drink; <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> for you will heap coals of fire on his
head, and the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> will reward you. <span
class="bibleverse">23</span> The north wind produces rain; so a
backbiting tongue brings an angry face. <span
class="bibleverse">24</span> It is better to dwell in the corner of the
housetop than to share a house with a contentious woman. <span
class="bibleverse">25</span> Like cold water to a thirsty soul, so is
good news from a far country. <span class="bibleverse">26</span> Like a
muddied spring and a polluted well, so is a righteous man who gives way
before the wicked. <span class="bibleverse">27</span> It is not good to
eat much honey, nor is it honourable to seek one’s own honour. <span
class="bibleverse">28</span> Like a city that is broken down and without
walls is a man whose spirit is without restraint.</p>
<h1 id="section-25">26</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Like snow in summer, and as rain in
harvest, so honour is not fitting for a fool. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> Like a fluttering sparrow, like a darting
swallow, so the undeserved curse doesn’t come to rest. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> A whip is for the horse, a bridle for the
donkey, and a rod for the back of fools! <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> Don’t answer a fool according to his folly,
lest you also be like him. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> Answer a
fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own eyes. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> One who sends a message by the hand of a
fool is cutting off feet and drinking violence. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> Like the legs of the lame that hang loose,
so is a parable in the mouth of fools. <span class="bibleverse">8</span>
As one who binds a stone in a sling, so is he who gives honour to a
fool. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> Like a thorn bush that goes into
the hand of a drunkard, so is a parable in the mouth of fools. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> As an archer who wounds all, so is he who
hires a fool or he who hires those who pass by. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> As a dog that returns to his vomit, so is a
fool who repeats his folly. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> Do you
see a man wise in his own eyes? There is more hope for a fool than for
him. <span class="bibleverse">13</span> The sluggard says, “There is a
lion in the road! A fierce lion roams the streets!” <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> As the door turns on its hinges, so does
the sluggard on his bed. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> The sluggard
buries his hand in the dish. He is too lazy to bring it back to his
mouth. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> The sluggard is wiser in his
own eyes than seven men who answer with discretion. <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> Like one who grabs a dog’s ears is one who
passes by and meddles in a quarrel not his own. <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> Like a madman who shoots torches, arrows,
and death, <span class="bibleverse">19</span> is the man who deceives
his neighbour and says, “Am I not joking?” <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> For lack of wood a fire goes out. Without
gossip, a quarrel dies down. <span class="bibleverse">21</span> As coals
are to hot embers, and wood to fire, so is a contentious man to kindling
strife. <span class="bibleverse">22</span> The words of a whisperer are
as dainty morsels, they go down into the innermost parts. <span
class="bibleverse">23</span> Like silver dross on an earthen vessel are
the lips of a fervent one with an evil heart. <span
class="bibleverse">24</span> A malicious man disguises himself with his
lips, but he harbours evil in his heart. <span
class="bibleverse">25</span> When his speech is charming, don’t believe
him, for there are seven abominations in his heart. <span
class="bibleverse">26</span> His malice may be concealed by deception,
but his wickedness will be exposed in the assembly. <span
class="bibleverse">27</span> Whoever digs a pit shall fall into it.
Whoever rolls a stone, it will come back on him. <span
class="bibleverse">28</span> A lying tongue hates those it hurts; and a
flattering mouth works ruin.</p>
<h1 id="section-26">27</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Don’t boast about tomorrow; for you
don’t know what a day may bring. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> Let
another man praise you, and not your own mouth; a stranger, and not your
own lips. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> A stone is heavy, and sand
is a burden; but a fool’s provocation is heavier than both. <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> Wrath is cruel, and anger is overwhelming;
but who is able to stand before jealousy? <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> Better is open rebuke than hidden love.
<span class="bibleverse">6</span> The wounds of a friend are faithful,
although the kisses of an enemy are profuse. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> A full soul loathes a honeycomb; but to a
hungry soul, every bitter thing is sweet. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> As a bird that wanders from her nest, so is
a man who wanders from his home. <span class="bibleverse">9</span>
Perfume and incense bring joy to the heart; so does earnest counsel from
a man’s friend. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> Don’t forsake your
friend and your father’s friend. Don’t go to your brother’s house in the
day of your disaster. A neighbour who is near is better than a distant
brother. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> Be wise, my son, and bring
joy to my heart, then I can answer my tormentor. <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> A prudent man sees danger and takes refuge;
but the simple pass on, and suffer for it. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> Take his garment when he puts up collateral
for a stranger. Hold it for a wayward woman! <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> He who blesses his neighbour with a loud
voice early in the morning, it will be taken as a curse by him. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> A continual dropping on a rainy day and a
contentious wife are alike: <span class="bibleverse">16</span>
restraining her is like restraining the wind, or like grasping oil in
his right hand. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> Iron sharpens iron;
so a man sharpens his friend’s countenance. <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> Whoever tends the fig tree shall eat its
fruit. He who looks after his master shall be honoured. <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> Like water reflects a face, so a man’s
heart reflects the man. <span class="bibleverse">20</span> Sheol<a
href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> and Abaddon are never satisfied;
and a man’s eyes are never satisfied. <span class="bibleverse">21</span>
The crucible is for silver, and the furnace for gold; but man is refined
by his praise. <span class="bibleverse">22</span> Though you grind a
fool in a mortar with a pestle along with grain, yet his foolishness
will not be removed from him. <span class="bibleverse">23</span> Know
well the state of your flocks, and pay attention to your herds, <span
class="bibleverse">24</span> for riches are not forever, nor does the
crown endure to all generations. <span class="bibleverse">25</span> The
hay is removed, and the new growth appears, the grasses of the hills are
gathered in. <span class="bibleverse">26</span> The lambs are for your
clothing, and the goats are the price of a field. <span
class="bibleverse">27</span> There will be plenty of goats’ milk for
your food, for your family’s food, and for the nourishment of your
servant girls.</p>
<h1 id="section-27">28</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> The wicked flee when no one
pursues; but the righteous are as bold as a lion. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> In rebellion, a land has many rulers, but
order is maintained by a man of understanding and knowledge. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> A needy man who oppresses the poor is like a
driving rain which leaves no crops. <span class="bibleverse">4</span>
Those who forsake the law praise the wicked; but those who keep the law
contend with them. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> Evil men don’t
understand justice; but those who seek the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> understand it fully. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> Better is the poor who walks in his
integrity than he who is perverse in his ways, and he is rich. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> Whoever keeps the law is a wise son; but he
who is a companion of gluttons shames his father. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> He who increases his wealth by excessive
interest gathers it for one who has pity on the poor. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> He who turns away his ear from hearing the
law, even his prayer is an abomination. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> Whoever causes the upright to go astray in
an evil way, he will fall into his own trap; but the blameless will
inherit good. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> The rich man is wise in
his own eyes; but the poor who has understanding sees through him. <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> When the righteous triumph, there is great
glory; but when the wicked rise, men hide themselves. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> He who conceals his sins doesn’t prosper,
but whoever confesses and renounces them finds mercy. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> Blessed is the man who always fears; but
one who hardens his heart falls into trouble. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> As a roaring lion or a charging bear, so is
a wicked ruler over helpless people. <span class="bibleverse">16</span>
A tyrannical ruler lacks judgement. One who hates ill-gotten gain will
have long days. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> A man who is
tormented by blood guilt will be a fugitive until death. No one will
support him. <span class="bibleverse">18</span> Whoever walks
blamelessly is kept safe; but one with perverse ways will fall suddenly.
<span class="bibleverse">19</span> One who works his land will have an
abundance of food; but one who chases fantasies will have his fill of
poverty. <span class="bibleverse">20</span> A faithful man is rich with
blessings; but one who is eager to be rich will not go unpunished. <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> To show partiality is not good, yet a man
will do wrong for a piece of bread. <span class="bibleverse">22</span> A
stingy man hurries after riches, and doesn’t know that poverty waits for
him. <span class="bibleverse">23</span> One who rebukes a man will
afterward find more favour than one who flatters with the tongue. <span
class="bibleverse">24</span> Whoever robs his father or his mother and
says, “It’s not wrong,” is a partner with a destroyer. <span
class="bibleverse">25</span> One who is greedy stirs up strife; but one
who trusts in the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> will prosper.
<span class="bibleverse">26</span> One who trusts in himself is a fool;
but one who walks in wisdom is kept safe. <span
class="bibleverse">27</span> One who gives to the poor has no lack; but
one who closes his eyes will have many curses. <span
class="bibleverse">28</span> When the wicked rise, men hide themselves;
but when they perish, the righteous thrive.</p>
<h1 id="section-28">29</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> He who is often rebuked and
stiffens his neck will be destroyed suddenly, with no remedy. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> When the righteous thrive, the people
rejoice; but when the wicked rule, the people groan. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> Whoever loves wisdom brings joy to his
father; but a companion of prostitutes squanders his wealth. <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> The king by justice makes the land stable,
but he who takes bribes tears it down. <span class="bibleverse">5</span>
A man who flatters his neighbour spreads a net for his feet. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> An evil man is snared by his sin, but the
righteous can sing and be glad. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> The
righteous care about justice for the poor. The wicked aren’t concerned
about knowledge. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> Mockers stir up a
city, but wise men turn away anger. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> If
a wise man goes to court with a foolish man, the fool rages or scoffs,
and there is no peace. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> The
bloodthirsty hate a man of integrity; and they seek the life of the
upright. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> A fool vents all of his
anger, but a wise man brings himself under control. <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> If a ruler listens to lies, all of his
officials are wicked. <span class="bibleverse">13</span> The poor man
and the oppressor have this in common: The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> gives sight to the eyes of both. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> The king who fairly judges the poor, his
throne shall be established forever. <span class="bibleverse">15</span>
The rod of correction gives wisdom, but a child left to himself causes
shame to his mother. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> When the wicked
increase, sin increases; but the righteous will see their downfall.
<span class="bibleverse">17</span> Correct your son, and he will give
you peace; yes, he will bring delight to your soul. <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> Where there is no revelation, the people
cast off restraint; but one who keeps the law is blessed. <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> A servant can’t be corrected by words.
Though he understands, yet he will not respond. <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> Do you see a man who is hasty in his words?
There is more hope for a fool than for him. <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> He who pampers his servant from youth will
have him become a son in the end. <span class="bibleverse">22</span> An
angry man stirs up strife, and a wrathful man abounds in sin. <span
class="bibleverse">23</span> A man’s pride brings him low, but one of
lowly spirit gains honour. <span class="bibleverse">24</span> Whoever is
an accomplice of a thief is an enemy of his own soul. He takes an oath,
but dares not testify. <span class="bibleverse">25</span> The fear of
man proves to be a snare, but whoever puts his trust in the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is kept safe. <span
class="bibleverse">26</span> Many seek the ruler’s favour, but a man’s
justice comes from the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. <span
class="bibleverse">27</span> A dishonest man detests the righteous, and
the upright in their ways detest the wicked.</p>

leech has two daughters: ‘Give, give.’ “There are three things that are
never satisfied; four that don’t say, ‘Enough!’: <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> Sheol,<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> the barren womb, the
earth that is not satisfied with water, and the fire that doesn’t say,
‘Enough!’ <span class="bibleverse">17</span> “The eye that mocks at his
father, and scorns obedience to his mother, the ravens of the valley
shall pick it out, the young eagles shall eat it. <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> “There are three things which are too
amazing for me, four which I don’t understand: <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> The way of an eagle in the air, the way of
a serpent on a rock, the way of a ship in the middle of the sea, and the
way of a man with a maiden. <span class="bibleverse">20</span> “So is
the way of an adulterous woman: She eats and wipes her mouth, and says,
‘I have done nothing wrong.’ <span class="bibleverse">21</span> “For
three things the earth trembles, and under four, it can’t bear up: <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> For a servant when he is king, a fool when
he is filled with food, <span class="bibleverse">23</span> for an
unloved woman when she is married, and a servant who is heir to her
mistress. <span class="bibleverse">24</span> “There are four things
which are little on the earth, but they are exceedingly wise: <span
class="bibleverse">25</span> The ants are not a strong people, yet they
provide their food in the summer. <span class="bibleverse">26</span> The
hyraxes are but a feeble folk, yet make they their houses in the rocks.
<span class="bibleverse">27</span> The locusts have no king, yet they
advance in ranks. <span class="bibleverse">28</span> You can catch a
lizard with your hands, yet it is in kings’ palaces. <span
class="bibleverse">29</span> “There are three things which are stately
in their march, four which are stately in going: <span
class="bibleverse">30</span> The lion, which is mightiest amongst
animals, and doesn’t turn away for any; <span
class="bibleverse">31</span> the greyhound; the male goat; and the king
against whom there is no rising up. <span class="bibleverse">32</span>
“If you have done foolishly in lifting up yourself, or if you have
thought evil, put your hand over your mouth. <span
class="bibleverse">33</span> For as the churning of milk produces
butter, and the wringing of the nose produces blood, so the forcing of
wrath produces strife.”</p>
<h1 id="section-30">31</h1>
<h2 id="sayings-for-lemuel">Sayings for Lemuel</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> The words of king Lemuel—the
revelation which his mother taught him: <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> “Oh, my son! Oh, son of my womb! Oh, son of
my vows! <span class="bibleverse">3</span> Don’t give your strength to
women, nor your ways to that which destroys kings. <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> It is not for kings, Lemuel, it is not for
kings to drink wine, nor for princes to say, ‘Where is strong drink?’
<span class="bibleverse">5</span> lest they drink, and forget the law,
and pervert the justice due to anyone who is afflicted. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> Give strong drink to him who is ready to
perish, and wine to the bitter in soul. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and
remember his misery no more. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> Open your
mouth for the mute, in the cause of all who are left desolate. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> Open your mouth, judge righteously, and
serve justice to the poor and needy.”</p>
<h2 id="praise-the-able-housewife">Praise the able housewife</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">10</span> <a href="#fn14"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>
Who can find a worthy woman? For her value is far above rubies. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> The heart of her husband trusts in her. He
shall have no lack of gain. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> She does
him good, and not harm, all the days of her life. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> She seeks wool and flax, and works eagerly
with her hands. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> She is like the
merchant ships. She brings her bread from afar. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> She rises also while it is yet night, gives
food to her household, and portions for her servant girls. <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> She considers a field, and buys it. With
the fruit of her hands, she plants a vineyard. <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> She arms her waist with strength, and makes
her arms strong. <span class="bibleverse">18</span> She perceives that
her merchandise is profitable. Her lamp doesn’t go out by night. <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> She lays her hands to the distaff, and her
hands hold the spindle. <span class="bibleverse">20</span> She opens her
arms to the poor; yes, she extends her hands to the needy. <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> She is not afraid of the snow for her
household, for all her household are clothed with scarlet. <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> She makes for herself carpets of tapestry.
Her clothing is fine linen and purple. <span
class="bibleverse">23</span> Her husband is respected in the gates, when
he sits amongst the elders of the land. <span
class="bibleverse">24</span> She makes linen garments and sells them,
and delivers sashes to the merchant. <span class="bibleverse">25</span>
Strength and dignity are her clothing. She laughs at the time to come.
<span class="bibleverse">26</span> She opens her mouth with wisdom. Kind
instruction is on her tongue. <span class="bibleverse">27</span> She
looks well to the ways of her household, and doesn’t eat the bread of
idleness. <span class="bibleverse">28</span> Her children rise up and
call her blessed. Her husband also praises her: <span
class="bibleverse">29</span> “Many women do noble things, but you excel
them all.” <span class="bibleverse">30</span> Charm is deceitful, and
beauty is vain; but a woman who fears the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, she shall be praised. <span
class="bibleverse">31</span> Give her of the fruit of her hands! Let her
works praise her in the gates!</p>
