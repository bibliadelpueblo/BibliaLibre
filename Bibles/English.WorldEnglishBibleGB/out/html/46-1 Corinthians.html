<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Paul, called to be an apostle of
Jesus Christ<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> through the will of God, and our
brother Sosthenes, <span class="bibleverse">2</span> to the assembly of
God which is at Corinth—those who are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called
saints, with all who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every
place, both theirs and ours: <span class="bibleverse">3</span> Grace to
you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">4</span> I always thank my God concerning
you for the grace of God which was given you in Christ Jesus, <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> that in everything you were enriched in him,
in all speech and all knowledge— <span class="bibleverse">6</span> even
as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you— <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> so that you come behind in no gift, waiting
for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ, <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> who will also confirm you until the end,
blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> God is faithful, through whom you were
called into the fellowship of his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">10</span> Now I beg you, brothers,<a
href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> through the name of our Lord, Jesus
Christ, that you all speak the same thing, and that there be no
divisions amongst you, but that you be perfected together in the same
mind and in the same judgement. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> For
it has been reported to me concerning you, my brothers, by those who are
from Chloe’s household, that there are contentions amongst you. <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> Now I mean this, that each one of you says,
“I follow Paul,” “I follow Apollos,” “I follow Cephas,” and, “I follow
Christ.” <span class="bibleverse">13</span> Is Christ divided? Was Paul
crucified for you? Or were you baptised into the name of Paul? <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> I thank God that I baptised none of you
except Crispus and Gaius, <span class="bibleverse">15</span> so that no
one should say that I had baptised you into my own name. <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> (I also baptised the household of
Stephanas; besides them, I don’t know whether I baptised any other.)
<span class="bibleverse">17</span> For Christ sent me not to baptise,
but to preach the Good News—not in wisdom of words, so that the cross of
Christ wouldn’t be made void. <span class="bibleverse">18</span> For the
word of the cross is foolishness to those who are dying, but to us who
are being saved it is the power of God. <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> For it is written, “I will destroy the
wisdom of the wise. I will bring the discernment of the discerning to
nothing.”<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">20</span> Where is the wise? Where is the
scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Hasn’t God made foolish the
wisdom of this world? <span class="bibleverse">21</span> For seeing that
in the wisdom of God, the world through its wisdom didn’t know God, it
was God’s good pleasure through the foolishness of the preaching to save
those who believe. <span class="bibleverse">22</span> For Jews ask for
signs, Greeks seek after wisdom, <span class="bibleverse">23</span> but
we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to
Greeks, <span class="bibleverse">24</span> but to those who are called,
both Jews and Greeks, Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God;
<span class="bibleverse">25</span> because the foolishness of God is
wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">26</span> For you see your calling,
brothers, that not many are wise according to the flesh, not many
mighty, and not many noble; <span class="bibleverse">27</span> but God
chose the foolish things of the world that he might put to shame those
who are wise. God chose the weak things of the world that he might put
to shame the things that are strong. <span class="bibleverse">28</span>
God chose the lowly things of the world, and the things that are
despised, and the things that don’t exist, that he might bring to
nothing the things that exist, <span class="bibleverse">29</span> that
no flesh should boast before God. <span class="bibleverse">30</span>
Because of him, you are in Christ Jesus, who was made to us wisdom from
God, and righteousness and sanctification, and redemption, <span
class="bibleverse">31</span> that, as it is written, “He who boasts, let
him boast in the Lord.”<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h1 id="section-1">2</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> When I came to you, brothers, I
didn’t come with excellence of speech or of wisdom, proclaiming to you
the testimony of God. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> For I determined
not to know anything amongst you except Jesus Christ and him crucified.
<span class="bibleverse">3</span> I was with you in weakness, in fear,
and in much trembling. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> My speech and
my preaching were not in persuasive words of human wisdom, but in
demonstration of the Spirit and of power, <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> that your faith wouldn’t stand in the wisdom
of men, but in the power of God.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">6</span> We speak wisdom, however, amongst
those who are full grown, yet a wisdom not of this world nor of the
rulers of this world who are coming to nothing. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> But we speak God’s wisdom in a mystery, the
wisdom that has been hidden, which God foreordained before the worlds
for our glory, <span class="bibleverse">8</span> which none of the
rulers of this world has known. For had they known it, they wouldn’t
have crucified the Lord of glory. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> But
as it is written, “Things which an eye didn’t see, and an ear didn’t
hear, which didn’t enter into the heart of man, these God has prepared
for those who love him.”<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">10</span> But to us, God revealed them
through the Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep
things of God. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> For who amongst men
knows the things of a man except the spirit of the man which is in him?
Even so, no one knows the things of God except God’s Spirit. <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> But we received not the spirit of the
world, but the Spirit which is from God, that we might know the things
that were freely given to us by God. <span class="bibleverse">13</span>
We also speak these things, not in words which man’s wisdom teaches but
which the Holy Spirit teaches, comparing spiritual things with spiritual
things. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> Now the natural man doesn’t
receive the things of God’s Spirit, for they are foolishness to him; and
he can’t know them, because they are spiritually discerned. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> But he who is spiritual discerns all
things, and he himself is to be judged by no one. <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> “For who has known the mind of the Lord
that he should instruct him?” <a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> But we have Christ’s
mind.</p>
<h1 id="section-2">3</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Brothers, I couldn’t speak to you
as to spiritual, but as to fleshly, as to babies in Christ. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> I fed you with milk, not with solid food,
for you weren’t yet ready. Indeed, you aren’t ready even now, <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> for you are still fleshly. For insofar as
there is jealousy, strife, and factions amongst you, aren’t you fleshly,
and don’t you walk in the ways of men? <span class="bibleverse">4</span>
For when one says, “I follow Paul,” and another, “I follow Apollos,”
aren’t you fleshly?</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">5</span> Who then is Apollos, and who is
Paul, but servants through whom you believed, and each as the Lord gave
to him? <span class="bibleverse">6</span> I planted. Apollos watered.
But God gave the increase. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> So then
neither he who plants is anything, nor he who waters, but God who gives
the increase. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> Now he who plants and he
who waters are the same, but each will receive his own reward according
to his own labour. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> For we are God’s
fellow workers. You are God’s farming, God’s building.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">10</span> According to the grace of God
which was given to me, as a wise master builder I laid a foundation, and
another builds on it. But let each man be careful how he builds on it.
<span class="bibleverse">11</span> For no one can lay any other
foundation than that which has been laid, which is Jesus Christ. <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> But if anyone builds on the foundation with
gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, or straw, <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> each man’s work will be revealed. For the
Day will declare it, because it is revealed in fire; and the fire itself
will test what sort of work each man’s work is. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> If any man’s work remains which he built on
it, he will receive a reward. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> If any
man’s work is burnt, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved,
but as through fire.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">16</span> Don’t you know that you are God’s
temple and that God’s Spirit lives in you? <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> If anyone destroys God’s temple, God will
destroy him; for God’s temple is holy, which you are.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">18</span> Let no one deceive himself. If
anyone thinks that he is wise amongst you in this world, let him become
a fool that he may become wise. <span class="bibleverse">19</span> For
the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, “He
has taken the wise in their craftiness.”<a href="#fn7"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>
<span class="bibleverse">20</span> And again, “The Lord knows the
reasoning of the wise, that it is worthless.”<a href="#fn8"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>
<span class="bibleverse">21</span> Therefore let no one boast in men.
For all things are yours, <span class="bibleverse">22</span> whether
Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things
present, or things to come. All are yours, <span
class="bibleverse">23</span> and you are Christ’s, and Christ is
God’s.</p>
<h1 id="section-3">4</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> So let a man think of us as
Christ’s servants and stewards of God’s mysteries. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> Here, moreover, it is required of stewards
that they be found faithful. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> But with
me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you, or by a
human court. Yes, I don’t even judge my own self. <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> For I know nothing against myself. Yet I am
not justified by this, but he who judges me is the Lord. <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> Therefore judge nothing before the time,
until the Lord comes, who will both bring to light the hidden things of
darkness and reveal the counsels of the hearts. Then each man will get
his praise from God.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">6</span> Now these things, brothers, I have
in a figure transferred to myself and Apollos for your sakes, that in us
you might learn not to think beyond the things which are written, that
none of you be puffed up against one another. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> For who makes you different? And what do you
have that you didn’t receive? But if you did receive it, why do you
boast as if you had not received it?</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">8</span> You are already filled. You have
already become rich. You have come to reign without us. Yes, and I wish
that you did reign, that we also might reign with you! <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> For I think that God has displayed us, the
apostles, last of all, like men sentenced to death. For we are made a
spectacle to the world, both to angels and men. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> We are fools for Christ’s sake, but you are
wise in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong. You have honour, but we
have dishonour. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> Even to this present
hour we hunger, thirst, are naked, are beaten, and have no certain
dwelling place. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> We toil, working with
our own hands. When people curse us, we bless. Being persecuted, we
endure. <span class="bibleverse">13</span> Being defamed, we entreat. We
are made as the filth of the world, the dirt wiped off by all, even
until now.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">14</span> I don’t write these things to
shame you, but to admonish you as my beloved children. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> For though you have ten thousand tutors in
Christ, you don’t have many fathers. For in Christ Jesus, I became your
father through the Good News. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> I beg
you therefore, be imitators of me. <span class="bibleverse">17</span>
Because of this I have sent Timothy to you, who is my beloved and
faithful child in the Lord, who will remind you of my ways which are in
Christ, even as I teach everywhere in every assembly. <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> Now some are puffed up, as though I were
not coming to you. <span class="bibleverse">19</span> But I will come to
you shortly, if the Lord is willing. And I will know, not the word of
those who are puffed up, but the power. <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> For God’s Kingdom is not in word, but in
power. <span class="bibleverse">21</span> What do you want? Shall I come
to you with a rod, or in love and a spirit of gentleness?</p>
<h1 id="section-4">5</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> It is actually reported that there
is sexual immorality amongst you, and such sexual immorality as is not
even named amongst the Gentiles, that one has his father’s wife. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> You are arrogant, and didn’t mourn instead,
that he who had done this deed might be removed from amongst you. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> For I most certainly, as being absent in
body but present in spirit, have already, as though I were present,
judged him who has done this thing. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> In
the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when you are gathered together with
my spirit with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> you are to deliver such a one to Satan for
the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of
the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">6</span> Your boasting is not good. Don’t
you know that a little yeast leavens the whole lump? <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> Purge out the old yeast, that you may be a
new lump, even as you are unleavened. For indeed Christ, our Passover,
has been sacrificed in our place. <span class="bibleverse">8</span>
Therefore let’s keep the feast, not with old yeast, neither with the
yeast of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of
sincerity and truth.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">9</span> I wrote to you in my letter to have
no company with sexual sinners; <span class="bibleverse">10</span> yet
not at all meaning with the sexual sinners of this world, or with the
covetous and extortionists, or with idolaters, for then you would have
to leave the world. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> But as it is, I
wrote to you not to associate with anyone who is called a brother who is
a sexual sinner, or covetous, or an idolater, or a slanderer, or a
drunkard, or an extortionist. Don’t even eat with such a person. <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> For what do I have to do with also judging
those who are outside? Don’t you judge those who are within? <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> But those who are outside, God judges. “Put
away the wicked man from amongst yourselves.”<a href="#fn9"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<h1 id="section-5">6</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Dare any of you, having a matter
against his neighbour, go to law before the unrighteous, and not before
the saints? <span class="bibleverse">2</span> Don’t you know that the
saints will judge the world? And if the world is judged by you, are you
unworthy to judge the smallest matters? <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> Don’t you know that we will judge angels?
How much more, things that pertain to this life? <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> If then you have to judge things pertaining
to this life, do you set them to judge who are of no account in the
assembly? <span class="bibleverse">5</span> I say this to move you to
shame. Isn’t there even one wise man amongst you who would be able to
decide between his brothers? <span class="bibleverse">6</span> But
brother goes to law with brother, and that before unbelievers! <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> Therefore it is already altogether a defect
in you that you have lawsuits one with another. Why not rather be
wronged? Why not rather be defrauded? <span class="bibleverse">8</span>
No, but you yourselves do wrong and defraud, and that against your
brothers.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">9</span> Or don’t you know that the
unrighteous will not inherit God’s Kingdom? Don’t be deceived. Neither
the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor male
prostitutes, nor homosexuals, <span class="bibleverse">10</span> nor
thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor slanderers, nor extortionists,
will inherit God’s Kingdom. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> Some of
you were such, but you were washed. You were sanctified. You were
justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and in the Spirit of our
God.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">12</span> “All things are lawful for me,”
but not all things are expedient. “All things are lawful for me,” but I
will not be brought under the power of anything. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> “Foods for the belly, and the belly for
foods,” but God will bring to nothing both it and them. But the body is
not for sexual immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.
<span class="bibleverse">14</span> Now God raised up the Lord, and will
also raise us up by his power. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> Don’t
you know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the
members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute? May it never
be! <span class="bibleverse">16</span> Or don’t you know that he who is
joined to a prostitute is one body? For, “The two”, he says, “will
become one flesh.”<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> <span class="bibleverse">17</span>
But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit. <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> Flee sexual immorality! “Every sin that a
man does is outside the body,” but he who commits sexual immorality sins
against his own body. <span class="bibleverse">19</span> Or don’t you
know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom
you have from God? You are not your own, <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> for you were bought with a price. Therefore
glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God’s.</p>
<h1 id="section-6">7</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Now concerning the things about
which you wrote to me: it is good for a man not to touch a woman. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> But, because of sexual immoralities, let
each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband.
<span class="bibleverse">3</span> Let the husband give his wife the
affection owed her,<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> and likewise also the wife her
husband. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> The wife doesn’t have
authority over her own body, but the husband does. Likewise also the
husband doesn’t have authority over his own body, but the wife does.
<span class="bibleverse">5</span> Don’t deprive one another, unless it
is by consent for a season, that you may give yourselves to fasting and
prayer, and may be together again, that Satan doesn’t tempt you because
of your lack of self-control.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">6</span> But this I say by way of
concession, not of commandment. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> Yet I
wish that all men were like me. However, each man has his own gift from
God, one of this kind, and another of that kind. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> But I say to the unmarried and to widows, it
is good for them if they remain even as I am. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> But if they don’t have self-control, let
them marry. For it’s better to marry than to burn with passion. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> But to the married I command—not I, but the
Lord—that the wife not leave her husband <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> (but if she departs, let her remain
unmarried, or else be reconciled to her husband), and that the husband
not leave his wife.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">12</span> But to the rest I—not the
Lord—say, if any brother has an unbelieving wife, and she is content to
live with him, let him not leave her. <span class="bibleverse">13</span>
The woman who has an unbelieving husband, and he is content to live with
her, let her not leave her husband. <span class="bibleverse">14</span>
For the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife, and the
unbelieving wife is sanctified in the husband. Otherwise your children
would be unclean, but now they are holy. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> Yet if the unbeliever departs, let there be
separation. The brother or the sister is not under bondage in such
cases, but God has called us in peace. <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> For how do you know, wife, whether you will
save your husband? Or how do you know, husband, whether you will save
your wife?</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">17</span> Only, as the Lord has distributed
to each man, as God has called each, so let him walk. So I command in
all the assemblies.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">18</span> Was anyone called having been
circumcised? Let him not become uncircumcised. Has anyone been called in
uncircumcision? Let him not be circumcised. <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision
is nothing, but what matters is keeping God’s commandments. <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> Let each man stay in that calling in which
he was called. <span class="bibleverse">21</span> Were you called being
a bondservant? Don’t let that bother you, but if you get an opportunity
to become free, use it. <span class="bibleverse">22</span> For he who
was called in the Lord being a bondservant is the Lord’s free man.
Likewise he who was called being free is Christ’s bondservant. <span
class="bibleverse">23</span> You were bought with a price. Don’t become
bondservants of men. <span class="bibleverse">24</span> Brothers, let
each man, in whatever condition he was called, stay in that condition
with God.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">25</span> Now concerning virgins, I have no
commandment from the Lord, but I give my judgement as one who has
obtained mercy from the Lord to be trustworthy. <span
class="bibleverse">26</span> Therefore I think that because of the
distress that is on us, it’s good for a man to remain as he is. <span
class="bibleverse">27</span> Are you bound to a wife? Don’t seek to be
freed. Are you free from a wife? Don’t seek a wife. <span
class="bibleverse">28</span> But if you marry, you have not sinned. If a
virgin marries, she has not sinned. Yet such will have oppression in the
flesh, and I want to spare you. <span class="bibleverse">29</span> But I
say this, brothers: the time is short. From now on, both those who have
wives may be as though they had none; <span class="bibleverse">30</span>
and those who weep, as though they didn’t weep; and those who rejoice,
as though they didn’t rejoice; and those who buy, as though they didn’t
possess; <span class="bibleverse">31</span> and those who use the world,
as not using it to the fullest. For the mode of this world passes
away.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">32</span> But I desire to have you to be
free from cares. He who is unmarried is concerned for the things of the
Lord, how he may please the Lord; <span class="bibleverse">33</span> but
he who is married is concerned about the things of the world, how he may
please his wife. <span class="bibleverse">34</span> There is also a
difference between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman cares about
the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit.
But she who is married cares about the things of the world—how she may
please her husband. <span class="bibleverse">35</span> This I say for
your own benefit, not that I may ensnare you, but for that which is
appropriate, and that you may attend to the Lord without
distraction.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">36</span> But if any man thinks that he is
behaving inappropriately towards his virgin, if she is past the flower
of her age, and if need so requires, let him do what he desires. He
doesn’t sin. Let them marry. <span class="bibleverse">37</span> But he
who stands steadfast in his heart, having no urgency, but has power over
his own will, and has determined in his own heart to keep his own
virgin, does well. <span class="bibleverse">38</span> So then both he
who gives his own virgin in marriage does well, and he who doesn’t give
her in marriage does better.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">39</span> A wife is bound by law for as long
as her husband lives; but if the husband is dead, she is free to be
married to whomever she desires, only in the Lord. <span
class="bibleverse">40</span> But she is happier if she stays as she is,
in my judgement, and I think that I also have God’s Spirit.</p>
<h1 id="section-7">8</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Now concerning things sacrificed to
idols: We know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love
builds up. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> But if anyone thinks that
he knows anything, he doesn’t yet know as he ought to know. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> But anyone who loves God is known by
him.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">4</span> Therefore concerning the eating of
things sacrificed to idols, we know that no idol is anything in the
world, and that there is no other God but one. <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> For though there are things that are called
“gods”, whether in the heavens or on earth—as there are many “gods” and
many “lords”— <span class="bibleverse">6</span> yet to us there is one
God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we for him; and one Lord,
Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we live through him.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">7</span> However, that knowledge isn’t in
all men. But some, with consciousness of an idol until now, eat as of a
thing sacrificed to an idol, and their conscience, being weak, is
defiled. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> But food will not commend us
to God. For neither, if we don’t eat are we the worse, nor if we eat are
we the better. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> But be careful that by
no means does this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to the
weak. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> For if a man sees you who have
knowledge sitting in an idol’s temple, won’t his conscience, if he is
weak, be emboldened to eat things sacrificed to idols? <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> And through your knowledge, he who is weak
perishes, the brother for whose sake Christ died. <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> Thus, sinning against the brothers, and
wounding their conscience when it is weak, you sin against Christ. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> Therefore, if food causes my brother to
stumble, I will eat no meat forever more, that I don’t cause my brother
to stumble.</p>
<h1 id="section-8">9</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Am I not free? Am I not an apostle?
Haven’t I seen Jesus Christ, our Lord? Aren’t you my work in the Lord?
<span class="bibleverse">2</span> If to others I am not an apostle, yet
at least I am to you; for you are the seal of my apostleship in the
Lord.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">3</span> My defence to those who examine me
is this: <span class="bibleverse">4</span> Have we no right to eat and
to drink? <span class="bibleverse">5</span> Have we no right to take
along a wife who is a believer, even as the rest of the apostles, and
the brothers of the Lord, and Cephas? <span class="bibleverse">6</span>
Or have only Barnabas and I no right to not work? <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> What soldier ever serves at his own expense?
Who plants a vineyard, and doesn’t eat of its fruit? Or who feeds a
flock, and doesn’t drink from the flock’s milk?</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">8</span> Do I speak these things according
to the ways of men? Or doesn’t the law also say the same thing? <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> For it is written in the law of Moses, “You
shall not muzzle an ox while it treads out the grain.”<a href="#fn12"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a>
Is it for the oxen that God cares, <span class="bibleverse">10</span> or
does he say it assuredly for our sake? Yes, it was written for our sake,
because he who ploughs ought to plough in hope, and he who threshes in
hope should partake of his hope. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> If
we sowed to you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we reap your
fleshly things? <span class="bibleverse">12</span> If others partake of
this right over you, don’t we yet more?</p>
<p>Nevertheless we didn’t use this right, but we bear all things, that
we may cause no hindrance to the Good News of Christ. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> Don’t you know that those who serve around
sacred things eat from the things of the temple, and those who wait on
the altar have their portion with the altar? <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> Even so the Lord ordained that those who
proclaim the Good News should live from the Good News.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">15</span> But I have used none of these
things, and I don’t write these things that it may be done so in my
case; for I would rather die, than that anyone should make my boasting
void. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> For if I preach the Good News,
I have nothing to boast about, for necessity is laid on me; but woe is
to me if I don’t preach the Good News. <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> For if I do this of my own will, I have a
reward. But if not of my own will, I have a stewardship entrusted to me.
<span class="bibleverse">18</span> What then is my reward? That when I
preach the Good News, I may present the Good News of Christ without
charge, so as not to abuse my authority in the Good News.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">19</span> For though I was free from all, I
brought myself under bondage to all, that I might gain the more. <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> To the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might
gain Jews; to those who are under the law, as under the law,<a
href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> that I might gain those who are
under the law; <span class="bibleverse">21</span> to those who are
without law, as without law (not being without law towards God, but
under law towards Christ), that I might win those who are without law.
<span class="bibleverse">22</span> To the weak I became as weak, that I
might gain the weak. I have become all things to all men, that I may by
all means save some. <span class="bibleverse">23</span> Now I do this
for the sake of the Good News, that I may be a joint partaker of it.
<span class="bibleverse">24</span> Don’t you know that those who run in
a race all run, but one receives the prize? Run like that, so that you
may win. <span class="bibleverse">25</span> Every man who strives in the
games exercises self-control in all things. Now they do it to receive a
corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible. <span
class="bibleverse">26</span> I therefore run like that, not aimlessly. I
fight like that, not beating the air, <span class="bibleverse">27</span>
but I beat my body and bring it into submission, lest by any means,
after I have preached to others, I myself should be disqualified.</p>
<h1 id="section-9">10</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Now I would not have you ignorant,
brothers, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed
through the sea; <span class="bibleverse">2</span> and were all baptised
into Moses in the cloud and in the sea; <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> and all ate the same spiritual food; <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> and all drank the same spiritual drink. For
they drank of a spiritual rock that followed them, and the rock was
Christ. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> However with most of them, God
was not well pleased, for they were overthrown in the wilderness.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">6</span> Now these things were our examples,
to the intent we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted.
<span class="bibleverse">7</span> Don’t be idolaters, as some of them
were. As it is written, “The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose
up to play.”<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> <span class="bibleverse">8</span>
Let’s not commit sexual immorality, as some of them committed, and in
one day twenty-three thousand fell. <span class="bibleverse">9</span>
Let’s not test Christ,<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> as some of them tested, and
perished by the serpents. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> Don’t
grumble, as some of them also grumbled, and perished by the destroyer.
<span class="bibleverse">11</span> Now all these things happened to them
by way of example, and they were written for our admonition, on whom the
ends of the ages have come. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> Therefore
let him who thinks he stands be careful that he doesn’t fall.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">13</span> No temptation has taken you except
what is common to man. God is faithful, who will not allow you to be
tempted above what you are able, but will with the temptation also make
the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">14</span> Therefore, my beloved, flee from
idolatry. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> I speak as to wise men.
Judge what I say. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> The cup of blessing
which we bless, isn’t it a sharing of the blood of Christ? The bread
which we break, isn’t it a sharing of the body of Christ? <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> Because there is one loaf of bread, we, who
are many, are one body; for we all partake of the one loaf of bread.
<span class="bibleverse">18</span> Consider Israel according to the
flesh. Don’t those who eat the sacrifices participate in the altar?</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">19</span> What am I saying then? That a
thing sacrificed to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything?
<span class="bibleverse">20</span> But I say that the things which the
Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons and not to God, and I don’t
desire that you would have fellowship with demons. <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> You can’t both drink the cup of the Lord
and the cup of demons. You can’t both partake of the table of the Lord
and of the table of demons. <span class="bibleverse">22</span> Or do we
provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than he?</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">23</span> “All things are lawful for me,”
but not all things are profitable. “All things are lawful for me,” but
not all things build up. <span class="bibleverse">24</span> Let no one
seek his own, but each one his neighbour’s good. <span
class="bibleverse">25</span> Whatever is sold in the butcher shop, eat,
asking no question for the sake of conscience, <span
class="bibleverse">26</span> for “the earth is the Lord’s, and its
fullness.”<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> <span class="bibleverse">27</span>
But if one of those who don’t believe invites you to a meal, and you are
inclined to go, eat whatever is set before you, asking no questions for
the sake of conscience. <span class="bibleverse">28</span> But if anyone
says to you, “This was offered to idols,” don’t eat it for the sake of
the one who told you, and for the sake of conscience. For “the earth is
the Lord’s, with all its fullness.” <span class="bibleverse">29</span>
Conscience, I say, not your own, but the other’s conscience. For why is
my liberty judged by another conscience? <span
class="bibleverse">30</span> If I partake with thankfulness, why am I
denounced for something I give thanks for?</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">31</span> Whether therefore you eat or
drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God. <span
class="bibleverse">32</span> Give no occasion for stumbling, whether to
Jews, to Greeks, or to the assembly of God; <span
class="bibleverse">33</span> even as I also please all men in all
things, not seeking my own profit, but the profit of the many, that they
may be saved.</p>
<h1 id="section-10">11</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Be imitators of me, even as I also
am of Christ.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">2</span> Now I praise you, brothers, that
you remember me in all things, and hold firm the traditions, even as I
delivered them to you. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> But I would
have you know that the head<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> of every man is
Christ, and the head<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> of the woman is man, and the head<a
href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> of Christ is God. <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> Every man praying or prophesying, having his
head covered, dishonours his head. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> But
every woman praying or prophesying with her head uncovered dishonours
her head. For it is one and the same thing as if she were shaved. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> For if a woman is not covered, let her hair
also be cut off. But if it is shameful for a woman to have her hair cut
off or be shaved, let her be covered. <span class="bibleverse">7</span>
For a man indeed ought not to have his head covered, because he is the
image and glory of God, but the woman is the glory of the man. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> For man is not from woman, but woman from
man; <span class="bibleverse">9</span> for man wasn’t created for the
woman, but woman for the man. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> For
this cause the woman ought to have authority over her own head, because
of the angels.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">11</span> Nevertheless, neither is the woman
independent of the man, nor the man independent of the woman, in the
Lord. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> For as woman came from man, so
a man also comes through a woman; but all things are from God. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> Judge for yourselves. Is it appropriate
that a woman pray to God unveiled? <span class="bibleverse">14</span>
Doesn’t even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is
a dishonour to him? <span class="bibleverse">15</span> But if a woman
has long hair, it is a glory to her, for her hair is given to her for a
covering. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> But if any man seems to be
contentious, we have no such custom, neither do God’s assemblies.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">17</span> But in giving you this command I
don’t praise you, because you come together not for the better but for
the worse. <span class="bibleverse">18</span> For first of all, when you
come together in the assembly, I hear that divisions exist amongst you,
and I partly believe it. <span class="bibleverse">19</span> For there
also must be factions amongst you, that those who are approved may be
revealed amongst you. <span class="bibleverse">20</span> When therefore
you assemble yourselves together, it is not the Lord’s supper that you
eat. <span class="bibleverse">21</span> For in your eating each one
takes his own supper first. One is hungry, and another is drunken. <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> What, don’t you have houses to eat and to
drink in? Or do you despise God’s assembly and put them to shame who
don’t have enough? What shall I tell you? Shall I praise you? In this I
don’t praise you.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">23</span> For I received from the Lord that
which also I delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night in which
he was betrayed took bread. <span class="bibleverse">24</span> When he
had given thanks, he broke it and said, “Take, eat. This is my body,
which is broken for you. Do this in memory of me.” <span
class="bibleverse">25</span> In the same way he also took the cup after
supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as
often as you drink, in memory of me.” <span class="bibleverse">26</span>
For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the
Lord’s death until he comes.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">27</span> Therefore whoever eats this bread
or drinks the Lord’s cup in a way unworthy of the Lord will be guilty of
the body and the blood of the Lord. <span class="bibleverse">28</span>
But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of the bread and drink
of the cup. <span class="bibleverse">29</span> For he who eats and
drinks in an unworthy way eats and drinks judgement to himself if he
doesn’t discern the Lord’s body. <span class="bibleverse">30</span> For
this cause many amongst you are weak and sickly, and not a few sleep.
<span class="bibleverse">31</span> For if we discerned ourselves, we
wouldn’t be judged. <span class="bibleverse">32</span> But when we are
judged, we are disciplined by the Lord, that we may not be condemned
with the world. <span class="bibleverse">33</span> Therefore, my
brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for one another. <span
class="bibleverse">34</span> But if anyone is hungry, let him eat at
home, lest your coming together be for judgement. The rest I will set in
order whenever I come.</p>
<h1 id="section-11">12</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Now concerning spiritual things,
brothers, I don’t want you to be ignorant. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> You know that when you were heathen,<a
href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> you were led away to those mute
idols, however you might be led. <span class="bibleverse">3</span>
Therefore I make known to you that no man speaking by God’s Spirit says,
“Jesus is accursed.” No one can say, “Jesus is Lord,” but by the Holy
Spirit.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">4</span> Now there are various kinds of
gifts, but the same Spirit. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> There are
various kinds of service, and the same Lord. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> There are various kinds of workings, but the
same God who works all things in all. <span class="bibleverse">7</span>
But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the profit
of all. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> For to one is given through
the Spirit the word of wisdom, and to another the word of knowledge
according to the same Spirit, <span class="bibleverse">9</span> to
another faith by the same Spirit, and to another gifts of healings by
the same Spirit, <span class="bibleverse">10</span> and to another
workings of miracles, and to another prophecy, and to another discerning
of spirits, to another different kinds of languages, and to another the
interpretation of languages. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> But the
one and the same Spirit produces all of these, distributing to each one
separately as he desires.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">12</span> For as the body is one and has
many members, and all the members of the body, being many, are one body;
so also is Christ. <span class="bibleverse">13</span> For in one Spirit
we were all baptised into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bond
or free; and were all given to drink into one Spirit.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">14</span> For the body is not one member,
but many. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> If the foot would say,
“Because I’m not the hand, I’m not part of the body,” it is not
therefore not part of the body. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> If
the ear would say, “Because I’m not the eye, I’m not part of the body,”
it’s not therefore not part of the body. <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> If the whole body were an eye, where would
the hearing be? If the whole were hearing, where would the smelling be?
<span class="bibleverse">18</span> But now God has set the members, each
one of them, in the body, just as he desired. <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> If they were all one member, where would
the body be? <span class="bibleverse">20</span> But now they are many
members, but one body. <span class="bibleverse">21</span> The eye can’t
tell the hand, “I have no need for you,” or again the head to the feet,
“I have no need for you.” <span class="bibleverse">22</span> No, much
rather, those members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary.
<span class="bibleverse">23</span> Those parts of the body which we
think to be less honourable, on those we bestow more abundant honour;
and our unpresentable parts have more abundant modesty, <span
class="bibleverse">24</span> while our presentable parts have no such
need. But God composed the body together, giving more abundant honour to
the inferior part, <span class="bibleverse">25</span> that there should
be no division in the body, but that the members should have the same
care for one another. <span class="bibleverse">26</span> When one member
suffers, all the members suffer with it. When one member is honoured,
all the members rejoice with it.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">27</span> Now you are the body of Christ,
and members individually. <span class="bibleverse">28</span> God has set
some in the assembly: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers,
then miracle workers, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, and
various kinds of languages. <span class="bibleverse">29</span> Are all
apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Are all miracle workers?
<span class="bibleverse">30</span> Do all have gifts of healings? Do all
speak with various languages? Do all interpret? <span
class="bibleverse">31</span> But earnestly desire the best gifts.
Moreover, I show a most excellent way to you.</p>
<h1 id="section-12">13</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> If I speak with the languages of
men and of angels, but don’t have love, I have become sounding brass or
a clanging cymbal. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> If I have the gift
of prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all
faith, so as to remove mountains, but don’t have love, I am nothing.
<span class="bibleverse">3</span> If I give away all my goods to feed
the poor, and if I give my body to be burnt, but don’t have love, it
profits me nothing.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">4</span> Love is patient and is kind. Love
doesn’t envy. Love doesn’t brag, is not proud, <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> doesn’t behave itself inappropriately,
doesn’t seek its own way, is not provoked, takes no account of evil;
<span class="bibleverse">6</span> doesn’t rejoice in unrighteousness,
but rejoices with the truth; <span class="bibleverse">7</span> bears all
things, believes all things, hopes all things, and endures all
things.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">8</span> Love never fails. But where there
are prophecies, they will be done away with. Where there are various
languages, they will cease. Where there is knowledge, it will be done
away with. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> For we know in part and we
prophesy in part; <span class="bibleverse">10</span> but when that which
is complete has come, then that which is partial will be done away with.
<span class="bibleverse">11</span> When I was a child, I spoke as a
child, I felt as a child, I thought as a child. Now that I have become a
man, I have put away childish things. <span class="bibleverse">12</span>
For now we see in a mirror, dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in
part, but then I will know fully, even as I was also fully known. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> But now faith, hope, and love remain—these
three. The greatest of these is love.</p>
<h1 id="section-13">14</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Follow after love and earnestly
desire spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> For he who speaks in another language speaks
not to men, but to God, for no one understands, but in the Spirit he
speaks mysteries. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> But he who
prophesies speaks to men for their edification, exhortation, and
consolation. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> He who speaks in another
language edifies himself, but he who prophesies edifies the assembly.
<span class="bibleverse">5</span> Now I desire to have you all speak
with other languages, but even more that you would prophesy. For he is
greater who prophesies than he who speaks with other languages, unless
he interprets, that the assembly may be built up.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">6</span> But now, brothers,<a href="#fn21"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a>
if I come to you speaking with other languages, what would I profit you
unless I speak to you either by way of revelation, or of knowledge, or
of prophesying, or of teaching? <span class="bibleverse">7</span> Even
lifeless things that make a sound, whether pipe or harp, if they didn’t
give a distinction in the sounds, how would it be known what is piped or
harped? <span class="bibleverse">8</span> For if the trumpet gave an
uncertain sound, who would prepare himself for war? <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> So also you, unless you uttered by the
tongue words easy to understand, how would it be known what is spoken?
For you would be speaking into the air. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> There are, it may be, so many kinds of
languages in the world, and none of them is without meaning. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> If then I don’t know the meaning of the
language, I would be to him who speaks a foreigner, and he who speaks
would be a foreigner to me. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> So also
you, since you are zealous for spiritual gifts, seek that you may abound
to the building up of the assembly.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">13</span> Therefore let him who speaks in
another language pray that he may interpret. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> For if I pray in another language, my
spirit prays, but my understanding is unfruitful.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">15</span> What should I do? I will pray with
the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also. I will sing
with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also. <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> Otherwise, if you bless with the spirit,
how will he who fills the place of the unlearned say the “Amen” at your
giving of thanks, seeing he doesn’t know what you say? <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> For you most certainly give thanks well,
but the other person is not built up. <span class="bibleverse">18</span>
I thank my God, I speak with other languages more than you all. <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> However, in the assembly I would rather
speak five words with my understanding, that I might instruct others
also, than ten thousand words in another language.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">20</span> Brothers, don’t be children in
thoughts, yet in malice be babies, but in thoughts be mature. <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> In the law it is written, “By men of
strange languages and by the lips of strangers I will speak to this
people. They won’t even listen to me that way, says the Lord.”<a
href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> <span class="bibleverse">22</span>
Therefore other languages are for a sign, not to those who believe, but
to the unbelieving; but prophesying is for a sign, not to the
unbelieving, but to those who believe. <span
class="bibleverse">23</span> If therefore the whole assembly is
assembled together and all speak with other languages, and unlearned or
unbelieving people come in, won’t they say that you are crazy? <span
class="bibleverse">24</span> But if all prophesy, and someone
unbelieving or unlearned comes in, he is reproved by all, and he is
judged by all. <span class="bibleverse">25</span> And thus the secrets
of his heart are revealed. So he will fall down on his face and worship
God, declaring that God is amongst you indeed.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">26</span> What is it then, brothers? When
you come together, each one of you has a psalm, has a teaching, has a
revelation, has another language, or has an interpretation. Let all
things be done to build each other up. <span
class="bibleverse">27</span> If any man speaks in another language, let
there be two, or at the most three, and in turn; and let one interpret.
<span class="bibleverse">28</span> But if there is no interpreter, let
him keep silent in the assembly, and let him speak to himself and to
God. <span class="bibleverse">29</span> Let two or three of the prophets
speak, and let the others discern. <span class="bibleverse">30</span>
But if a revelation is made to another sitting by, let the first keep
silent. <span class="bibleverse">31</span> For you all can prophesy one
by one, that all may learn and all may be exhorted. <span
class="bibleverse">32</span> The spirits of the prophets are subject to
the prophets, <span class="bibleverse">33</span> for God is not a God of
confusion but of peace, as in all the assemblies of the saints. <span
class="bibleverse">34</span> Let the wives be quiet in the assemblies,
for it has not been permitted for them to be talking except in
submission, as the law also says,<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> <span
class="bibleverse">35</span> if they desire to learn anything. “Let them
ask their own husbands at home, for it is shameful for a wife to be
talking in the assembly.” <span class="bibleverse">36</span> What!? Was
it from you that the word of God went out? Or did it come to you
alone?</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">37</span> If any man thinks himself to be a
prophet or spiritual, let him recognise the things which I write to you,
that they are the commandment of the Lord. <span
class="bibleverse">38</span> But if anyone is ignorant, let him be
ignorant.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">39</span> Therefore, brothers, desire
earnestly to prophesy, and don’t forbid speaking with other languages.
<span class="bibleverse">40</span> Let all things be done decently and
in order.</p>
<h1 id="section-14">15</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Now I declare to you, brothers, the
Good News which I preached to you, which also you received, in which you
also stand, <span class="bibleverse">2</span> by which also you are
saved, if you hold firmly the word which I preached to you—unless you
believed in vain.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">3</span> For I delivered to you first of all
that which I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to
the Scriptures, <span class="bibleverse">4</span> that he was buried,
that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the
twelve. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> Then he appeared to over five
hundred brothers at once, most of whom remain until now, but some have
also fallen asleep. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> Then he appeared
to James, then to all the apostles, <span class="bibleverse">8</span>
and last of all, as to the child born at the wrong time, he appeared to
me also. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> For I am the least of the
apostles, who is not worthy to be called an apostle, because I
persecuted the assembly of God. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> But
by the grace of God I am what I am. His grace which was given to me was
not futile, but I worked more than all of them; yet not I, but the grace
of God which was with me. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> Whether
then it is I or they, so we preach, and so you believed.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">12</span> Now if Christ is preached, that he
has been raised from the dead, how do some amongst you say that there is
no resurrection of the dead? <span class="bibleverse">13</span> But if
there is no resurrection of the dead, neither has Christ been raised.
<span class="bibleverse">14</span> If Christ has not been raised, then
our preaching is in vain and your faith also is in vain. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> Yes, we are also found false witnesses of
God, because we testified about God that he raised up Christ, whom he
didn’t raise up if it is true that the dead are not raised. <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> For if the dead aren’t raised, neither has
Christ been raised. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> If Christ has not
been raised, your faith is vain; you are still in your sins. <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> Then they also who are fallen asleep in
Christ have perished. <span class="bibleverse">19</span> If we have only
hoped in Christ in this life, we are of all men most pitiable.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">20</span> But now Christ has been raised
from the dead. He became the first fruit of those who are asleep. <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> For since death came by man, the
resurrection of the dead also came by man. <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ
all will be made alive. <span class="bibleverse">23</span> But each in
his own order: Christ the first fruits, then those who are Christ’s at
his coming. <span class="bibleverse">24</span> Then the end comes, when
he will deliver up the Kingdom to God the Father, when he will have
abolished all rule and all authority and power. <span
class="bibleverse">25</span> For he must reign until he has put all his
enemies under his feet. <span class="bibleverse">26</span> The last
enemy that will be abolished is death. <span
class="bibleverse">27</span> For, “He put all things in subjection under
his feet.”<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> But when he says, “All things are
put in subjection”, it is evident that he is excepted who subjected all
things to him. <span class="bibleverse">28</span> When all things have
been subjected to him, then the Son will also himself be subjected to
him who subjected all things to him, that God may be all in all.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">29</span> Or else what will they do who are
baptised for the dead? If the dead aren’t raised at all, why then are
they baptised for the dead? <span class="bibleverse">30</span> Why do we
also stand in jeopardy every hour? <span class="bibleverse">31</span> I
affirm, by the boasting in you which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I
die daily. <span class="bibleverse">32</span> If I fought with animals
at Ephesus for human purposes, what does it profit me? If the dead are
not raised, then “let’s eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.”<a
href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> <span class="bibleverse">33</span>
Don’t be deceived! “Evil companionships corrupt good morals.” <span
class="bibleverse">34</span> Wake up righteously and don’t sin, for some
have no knowledge of God. I say this to your shame.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">35</span> But someone will say, “How are the
dead raised?” and, “With what kind of body do they come?” <span
class="bibleverse">36</span> You foolish one, that which you yourself
sow is not made alive unless it dies. <span class="bibleverse">37</span>
That which you sow, you don’t sow the body that will be, but a bare
grain, maybe of wheat, or of some other kind. <span
class="bibleverse">38</span> But God gives it a body even as it pleased
him, and to each seed a body of its own. <span
class="bibleverse">39</span> All flesh is not the same flesh, but there
is one flesh of men, another flesh of animals, another of fish, and
another of birds. <span class="bibleverse">40</span> There are also
celestial bodies and terrestrial bodies; but the glory of the celestial
differs from that of the terrestrial. <span class="bibleverse">41</span>
There is one glory of the sun, another glory of the moon, and another
glory of the stars; for one star differs from another star in glory.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">42</span> So also is the resurrection of the
dead. The body is sown perishable; it is raised imperishable. <span
class="bibleverse">43</span> It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in
glory. It is sown in weakness; it is raised in power. <span
class="bibleverse">44</span> It is sown a natural body; it is raised a
spiritual body. There is a natural body and there is also a spiritual
body.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">45</span> So also it is written, “The first
man Adam became a living soul.” <a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref26" role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a> The last Adam became a
life-giving spirit. <span class="bibleverse">46</span> However, that
which is spiritual isn’t first, but that which is natural, then that
which is spiritual. <span class="bibleverse">47</span> The first man is
of the earth, made of dust. The second man is the Lord from heaven.
<span class="bibleverse">48</span> As is the one made of dust, such are
those who are also made of dust; and as is the heavenly, such are they
also that are heavenly. <span class="bibleverse">49</span> As we have
borne the image of those made of dust, let’s<a href="#fn27"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a>
also bear the image of the heavenly. <span class="bibleverse">50</span>
Now I say this, brothers,<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a> that flesh and blood
can’t inherit God’s Kingdom; neither does the perishable inherit
imperishable.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">51</span> Behold,<a href="#fn29"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a> I
tell you a mystery. We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed,
<span class="bibleverse">52</span> in a moment, in the twinkling of an
eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound and the dead will
be raised incorruptible, and we will be changed. <span
class="bibleverse">53</span> For this perishable body must become
imperishable, and this mortal must put on immortality. <span
class="bibleverse">54</span> But when this perishable body will have
become imperishable, and this mortal will have put on immortality, then
what is written will happen: “Death is swallowed up in victory.”<a
href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a> <span class="bibleverse">55</span>
“Death, where is your sting? Hades,<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a> where is your
victory?”<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">56</span> The sting of death is sin, and the
power of sin is the law. <span class="bibleverse">57</span> But thanks
be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. <span
class="bibleverse">58</span> Therefore, my beloved brothers, be
steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the Lord’s work, because you
know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.</p>
<h1 id="section-15">16</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Now concerning the collection for
the saints: as I commanded the assemblies of Galatia, you do likewise.
<span class="bibleverse">2</span> On the first day of every week, let
each one of you save as he may prosper, that no collections are made
when I come. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> When I arrive, I will
send whoever you approve with letters to carry your gracious gift to
Jerusalem. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> If it is appropriate for me
to go also, they will go with me.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">5</span> I will come to you when I have
passed through Macedonia, for I am passing through Macedonia. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> But with you it may be that I will stay with
you, or even winter with you, that you may send me on my journey
wherever I go. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> For I do not wish to
see you now in passing, but I hope to stay a while with you, if the Lord
permits. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> But I will stay at Ephesus
until Pentecost, <span class="bibleverse">9</span> for a great and
effective door has opened to me, and there are many adversaries.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">10</span> Now if Timothy comes, see that he
is with you without fear, for he does the work of the Lord, as I also
do. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> Therefore let no one despise him.
But set him forward on his journey in peace, that he may come to me; for
I expect him with the brothers.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">12</span> Now concerning Apollos the
brother, I strongly urged him to come to you with the brothers, but it
was not at all his desire to come now; but he will come when he has an
opportunity.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">13</span> Watch! Stand firm in the faith! Be
courageous! Be strong! <span class="bibleverse">14</span> Let all that
you do be done in love.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">15</span> Now I beg you, brothers—you know
the house of Stephanas, that it is the first fruits of Achaia, and that
they have set themselves to serve the saints— <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> that you also be in subjection to such, and
to everyone who helps in the work and labours. <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas,
Fortunatus, and Achaicus; for that which was lacking on your part, they
supplied. <span class="bibleverse">18</span> For they refreshed my
spirit and yours. Therefore acknowledge those who are like that.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">19</span> The assemblies of Asia greet you.
Aquila and Priscilla greet you warmly in the Lord, together with the
assembly that is in their house. <span class="bibleverse">20</span> All
the brothers greet you. Greet one another with a holy kiss.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">21</span> This greeting is by me, Paul, with
my own hand. <span class="bibleverse">22</span> If any man doesn’t love
the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be cursed.<a href="#fn33"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a>
Come, Lord!<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a> <span class="bibleverse">23</span>
The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you. <span
class="bibleverse">24</span> My love to all of you in Christ Jesus.
Amen.</p>
