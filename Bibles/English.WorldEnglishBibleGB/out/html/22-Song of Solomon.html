<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> The Song of songs, which is
Solomon’s.<br />
<em>Beloved</em><br />
<span class="bibleverse">2</span> Let him kiss me with the kisses of his
mouth; for your love is better than wine. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> Your oils have a pleasing fragrance. Your
name is oil poured out, therefore the virgins love you. <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> Take me away with you. Let’s hurry. The king
has brought me into his rooms.<br />
<em>Friends</em><br />
We will be glad and rejoice in you. We will praise your love more than
wine!<br />
<em>Beloved</em><br />
They are right to love you. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> I am dark,
but lovely, you daughters of Jerusalem, like Kedar’s tents, like
Solomon’s curtains. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> Don’t stare at me
because I am dark, because the sun has scorched me. My mother’s sons
were angry with me. They made me keeper of the vineyards. I haven’t kept
my own vineyard. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> Tell me, you whom my
soul loves, where you graze your flock, where you rest them at noon; for
why should I be as one who is veiled beside the flocks of your
companions?<br />
<em>Lover</em><br />
<span class="bibleverse">8</span> If you don’t know, most beautiful
amongst women, follow the tracks of the sheep. Graze your young goats
beside the shepherds’ tents. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> I have
compared you, my love, to a steed in Pharaoh’s chariots. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> Your cheeks are beautiful with earrings,
your neck with strings of jewels.<br />
<em>Friends</em><br />
<span class="bibleverse">11</span> We will make you earrings of gold,
with studs of silver.<br />
<em>Beloved</em><br />
<span class="bibleverse">12</span> While the king sat at his table, my
perfume spread its fragrance. <span class="bibleverse">13</span> My
beloved is to me a sachet of myrrh, that lies between my breasts. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> My beloved is to me a cluster of henna
blossoms from the vineyards of En Gedi.<br />
<em>Lover</em><br />
<span class="bibleverse">15</span> Behold,<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> you
are beautiful, my love. Behold, you are beautiful. Your eyes are like
doves.<br />
<em>Beloved</em><br />
<span class="bibleverse">16</span> Behold, you are beautiful, my
beloved, yes, pleasant; and our couch is verdant.<br />
<em>Lover</em><br />
<span class="bibleverse">17</span> The beams of our house are cedars.
Our rafters are firs.</p>

<p><em><br />
</em>Beloved* *<br />
</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> I am a rose of Sharon, a lily of
the valleys.<br />
<em>Lover</em><br />
<span class="bibleverse">2</span> As a lily amongst thorns, so is my
love amongst the daughters.<br />
<em>Beloved</em><br />
<span class="bibleverse">3</span> As the apple tree amongst the trees of
the wood, so is my beloved amongst the sons. I sat down under his shadow
with great delight, his fruit was sweet to my taste. <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> He brought me to the banquet hall. His
banner over me is love. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> Strengthen me
with raisins, refresh me with apples; for I am faint with love. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> His left hand is under my head. His right
hand embraces me. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> I adjure you,
daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, or by the hinds of the field, that
you not stir up, nor awaken love, until it so desires. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> The voice of my beloved! Behold, he comes,
leaping on the mountains, skipping on the hills. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> My beloved is like a roe or a young deer.
Behold, he stands behind our wall! He looks in at the windows. He
glances through the lattice. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> My
beloved spoke, and said to me, “Rise up, my love, my beautiful one, and
come away. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> For behold, the winter is
past. The rain is over and gone. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> The
flowers appear on the earth. The time of the singing has come, and the
voice of the turtledove is heard in our land. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> The fig tree ripens her green figs. The
vines are in blossom. They give out their fragrance. Arise, my love, my
beautiful one, and come away.”<br />
<em>Lover</em><br />
<span class="bibleverse">14</span> My dove in the clefts of the rock, in
the hiding places of the mountainside, let me see your face. Let me hear
your voice; for your voice is sweet and your face is lovely. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> Catch for us the foxes, the little foxes
that plunder the vineyards; for our vineyards are in blossom.<br />
<em>Beloved</em><br />
<span class="bibleverse">16</span> My beloved is mine, and I am his. He
browses amongst the lilies. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> Until the
day is cool, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and be like a
roe or a young deer on the mountains of Bether.</p>
<h1 id="section-2">3</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> By night on my bed, I sought him
whom my soul loves. I sought him, but I didn’t find him. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> I will get up now, and go about the city; in
the streets and in the squares I will seek him whom my soul loves. I
sought him, but I didn’t find him. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> The
watchmen who go about the city found me; “Have you seen him whom my soul
loves?” <span class="bibleverse">4</span> I had scarcely passed from
them, when I found him whom my soul loves. I held him, and would not let
him go, until I had brought him into my mother’s house, into the room of
her who conceived me. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> I adjure you,
daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, or by the hinds of the field, that
you not stir up nor awaken love, until it so desires. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> Who is this who comes up from the wilderness
like pillars of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with all
spices of the merchant? <span class="bibleverse">7</span> Behold, it is
Solomon’s carriage! Sixty mighty men are around it, of the mighty men of
Israel. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> They all handle the sword, and
are expert in war. Every man has his sword on his thigh, because of fear
in the night. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> King Solomon made
himself a carriage of the wood of Lebanon. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> He made its pillars of silver, its bottom
of gold, its seat of purple, the middle of it being paved with love,
from the daughters of Jerusalem. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> Go
out, you daughters of Zion, and see king Solomon, with the crown with
which his mother has crowned him, in the day of his weddings, in the day
of the gladness of his heart.</p>
<h1 id="section-3">4</h1>
<p><em><br />
</em>Lover* *<br />
</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Behold, you are beautiful, my love.
Behold, you are beautiful. Your eyes are like doves behind your veil.
Your hair is as a flock of goats, that descend from Mount Gilead. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> Your teeth are like a newly shorn flock,
which have come up from the washing, where every one of them has twins.
None is bereaved amongst them. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> Your
lips are like scarlet thread. Your mouth is lovely. Your temples are
like a piece of a pomegranate behind your veil. <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> Your neck is like David’s tower built for an
armoury, on which a thousand shields hang, all the shields of the mighty
men. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> Your two breasts are like two
fawns that are twins of a roe, which feed amongst the lilies. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> Until the day is cool, and the shadows flee
away, I will go to the mountain of myrrh, to the hill of frankincense.
<span class="bibleverse">7</span> You are all beautiful, my love. There
is no spot in you. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> Come with me from
Lebanon, my bride, with me from Lebanon. Look from the top of Amana,
from the top of Senir and Hermon, from the lions’ dens, from the
mountains of the leopards. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> You have
ravished my heart, my sister, my bride. You have ravished my heart with
one of your eyes, with one chain of your neck. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> How beautiful is your love, my sister, my
bride! How much better is your love than wine, the fragrance of your
perfumes than all kinds of spices! <span class="bibleverse">11</span>
Your lips, my bride, drip like the honeycomb. Honey and milk are under
your tongue. The smell of your garments is like the smell of Lebanon.
<span class="bibleverse">12</span> My sister, my bride, is a locked up
garden; a locked up spring, a sealed fountain. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> Your shoots are an orchard of pomegranates,
with precious fruits, henna with spikenard plants, <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> spikenard and saffron, calamus and
cinnamon, with every kind of incense tree; myrrh and aloes, with all the
best spices, <span class="bibleverse">15</span> a fountain of gardens, a
well of living waters, flowing streams from Lebanon.<br />
<em>Beloved</em><br />
<span class="bibleverse">16</span> Awake, north wind, and come, you
south! Blow on my garden, that its spices may flow out. Let my beloved
come into his garden, and taste his precious fruits.</p>
<h1 id="section-4">5</h1>
<p><em><br />
</em>Lover* *<br />
</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> I have come into my garden, my
sister, my bride. I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten
my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk.<br />
<em>Friends</em><br />
Eat, friends! Drink, yes, drink abundantly, beloved.<br />
<em>Beloved</em><br />
<span class="bibleverse">2</span> I was asleep, but my heart was awake.
It is the voice of my beloved who knocks: “Open to me, my sister, my
love, my dove, my undefiled; for my head is filled with dew, and my hair
with the dampness of the night.” <span class="bibleverse">3</span> I
have taken off my robe. Indeed, must I put it on? I have washed my feet.
Indeed, must I soil them? <span class="bibleverse">4</span> My beloved
thrust his hand in through the latch opening. My heart pounded for him.
<span class="bibleverse">5</span> I rose up to open for my beloved. My
hands dripped with myrrh, my fingers with liquid myrrh, on the handles
of the lock. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> I opened to my beloved;
but my beloved left, and had gone away. My heart went out when he spoke.
I looked for him, but I didn’t find him. I called him, but he didn’t
answer. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> The watchmen who go about the
city found me. They beat me. They bruised me. The keepers of the walls
took my cloak away from me. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> I adjure
you, daughters of Jerusalem, If you find my beloved, that you tell him
that I am faint with love.<br />
<em>Friends</em><br />
<span class="bibleverse">9</span> How is your beloved better than
another beloved, you fairest amongst women? How is your beloved better
than another beloved, that you do so adjure us?<br />
<em>Beloved</em><br />
<span class="bibleverse">10</span> My beloved is white and ruddy. The
best amongst ten thousand. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> His head
is like the purest gold. His hair is bushy, black as a raven. <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> His eyes are like doves beside the water
brooks, washed with milk, mounted like jewels. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> His cheeks are like a bed of spices with
towers of perfumes. His lips are like lilies, dropping liquid myrrh.
<span class="bibleverse">14</span> His hands are like rings of gold set
with beryl. His body is like ivory work overlaid with sapphires. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> His legs are like pillars of marble set on
sockets of fine gold. His appearance is like Lebanon, excellent as the
cedars. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> His mouth is sweetness; yes,
he is altogether lovely. This is my beloved, and this is my friend,
daughters of Jerusalem.</p>
<h1 id="section-5">6</h1>
<p><em><br />
</em>Friends* *<br />
</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Where has your beloved gone, you
fairest amongst women? Where has your beloved turned, that we may seek
him with you?<br />
<em>Beloved</em><br />
<span class="bibleverse">2</span> My beloved has gone down to his
garden, to the beds of spices, to pasture his flock in the gardens, and
to gather lilies. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> I am my beloved’s,
and my beloved is mine. He browses amongst the lilies.<br />
<em>Lover</em><br />
<span class="bibleverse">4</span> You are beautiful, my love, as Tirzah,
lovely as Jerusalem, awesome as an army with banners. <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> Turn away your eyes from me, for they have
overcome me. Your hair is like a flock of goats, that lie along the side
of Gilead. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> Your teeth are like a flock
of ewes, which have come up from the washing, of which every one has
twins; not one is bereaved amongst them. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> Your temples are like a piece of a
pomegranate behind your veil. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> There
are sixty queens, eighty concubines, and virgins without number. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> My dove, my perfect one, is unique. She is
her mother’s only daughter. She is the favourite one of her who bore
her. The daughters saw her, and called her blessed. The queens and the
concubines saw her, and they praised her. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> Who is she who looks out as the morning,
beautiful as the moon, clear as the sun, and awesome as an army with
banners? <span class="bibleverse">11</span> I went down into the nut
tree grove, to see the green plants of the valley, to see whether the
vine budded, and the pomegranates were in flower. <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> Without realising it, my desire set me with
my royal people’s chariots.<br />
<em>Friends</em><br />
<span class="bibleverse">13</span> Return, return, Shulammite! Return,
return, that we may gaze at you.<br />
<em>Lover</em><br />
Why do you desire to gaze at the Shulammite, as at the dance of
Mahanaim?</p>
<h1 id="section-6">7</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> How beautiful are your feet in
sandals, prince’s daughter! Your rounded thighs are like jewels, the
work of the hands of a skilful workman. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> Your body is like a round goblet, no mixed
wine is wanting. Your waist is like a heap of wheat, set about with
lilies. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> Your two breasts are like two
fawns, that are twins of a roe. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> Your
neck is like an ivory tower. Your eyes are like the pools in Heshbon by
the gate of Bathrabbim. Your nose is like the tower of Lebanon which
looks towards Damascus. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> Your head on
you is like Carmel. The hair of your head like purple. The king is held
captive in its tresses. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> How beautiful
and how pleasant you are, love, for delights! <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> This, your stature, is like a palm tree,
your breasts like its fruit. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> I said,
“I will climb up into the palm tree. I will take hold of its fruit.” Let
your breasts be like clusters of the vine, the smell of your breath like
apples. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> Your mouth is like the best
wine, that goes down smoothly for my beloved, gliding through the lips
of those who are asleep.<br />
<em>Beloved</em><br />
<span class="bibleverse">10</span> I am my beloved’s. His desire is
towards me. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> Come, my beloved! Let’s
go out into the field. Let’s lodge in the villages. <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> Let’s go early up to the vineyards. Let’s
see whether the vine has budded, its blossom is open, and the
pomegranates are in flower. There I will give you my love. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> The mandrakes produce fragrance. At our
doors are all kinds of precious fruits, new and old, which I have stored
up for you, my beloved.</p>
<h1 id="section-7">8</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Oh that you were like my brother,
who nursed from the breasts of my mother! If I found you outside, I
would kiss you; yes, and no one would despise me. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> I would lead you, bringing you into the
house of my mother, who would instruct me. I would have you drink spiced
wine, of the juice of my pomegranate. <span class="bibleverse">3</span>
His left hand would be under my head. His right hand would embrace me.
<span class="bibleverse">4</span> I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem,
that you not stir up, nor awaken love, until it so desires.<br />
<em>Friends</em><br />
<span class="bibleverse">5</span> Who is this who comes up from the
wilderness, leaning on her beloved?<br />
<em>Beloved</em><br />
Under the apple tree I awakened you. There your mother conceived you.
There she was in labour and bore you. <span class="bibleverse">6</span>
Set me as a seal on your heart, as a seal on your arm; for love is
strong as death. Jealousy is as cruel as Sheol.<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Its
flashes are flashes of fire, a very flame of the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> Many waters can’t quench love, neither can
floods drown it. If a man would give all the wealth of his house for
love, he would be utterly scorned.<br />
<em>Brothers</em><br />
<span class="bibleverse">8</span> We have a little sister. She has no
breasts. What shall we do for our sister in the day when she is to be
spoken for? <span class="bibleverse">9</span> If she is a wall, we will
build on her a turret of silver. If she is a door, we will enclose her
with boards of cedar.<br />
<em>Beloved</em><br />
<span class="bibleverse">10</span> I am a wall, and my breasts like
towers, then I was in his eyes like one who found peace. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> Solomon had a vineyard at Baal Hamon. He
leased out the vineyard to keepers. Each was to bring a thousand
shekels<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> of silver for its fruit. <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> My own vineyard is before me. The thousand
are for you, Solomon, two hundred for those who tend its fruit.<br />
<em>Lover</em><br />
<span class="bibleverse">13</span> You who dwell in the gardens, with
friends in attendance, let me hear your voice!<br />
<em>Beloved</em><br />
<span class="bibleverse">14</span> Come away, my beloved! Be like a
gazelle or a young stag on the mountains of spices!</p>
