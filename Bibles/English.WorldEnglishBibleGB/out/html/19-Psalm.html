<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Blessed is the man who doesn’t walk
in the counsel of the wicked, nor stand on the path of sinners, nor sit
in the seat of scoffers; <span class="bibleverse">2</span> but his
delight is in the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
law. On his law he meditates day and night. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> He will be like a tree planted by the
streams of water, that produces its fruit in its season, whose leaf also
does not wither. Whatever he does shall prosper. <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> The wicked are not so, but are like the
chaff which the wind drives away. <span class="bibleverse">5</span>
Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgement, nor sinners in
the congregation of the righteous. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> For
the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> knows the way of the righteous,
but the way of the wicked shall perish.</p>
<h1 id="section-1">2</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Why do the nations rage, and the
peoples plot a vain thing? <span class="bibleverse">2</span> The kings
of the earth take a stand, and the rulers take counsel together, against
the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and against his Anointed,<a

role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> saying, <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> “Let’s break their bonds apart, and cast
their cords from us.” <span class="bibleverse">4</span> He who sits in
the heavens will laugh. The Lord<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> will have them in
derision. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> Then he will speak to them
in his anger, and terrify them in his wrath: <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> “Yet I have set my King on my holy hill of
Zion.” <span class="bibleverse">7</span> I will tell of the decree: The
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> said to me, “You are my son. Today I
have become your father. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> Ask of me,
and I will give the nations for your inheritance, the uttermost parts of
the earth for your possession. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> You
shall break them with a rod of iron. You shall dash them in pieces like
a potter’s vessel.” <span class="bibleverse">10</span> Now therefore be
wise, you kings. Be instructed, you judges of the earth. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> Serve the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> with fear, and rejoice with trembling.
<span class="bibleverse">12</span> Give sincere homage to the Son,<a
href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"

the way, for his wrath will soon be kindled. Blessed are all those who
take refuge in him.</p>

<p><em>A Psalm by David, when he fled from Absalom his son.</em><br />
<span class="bibleverse">1</span> <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>,
how my adversaries have increased! Many are those who rise up against
me. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> Many there are who say of my soul,
“There is no help for him in God.”<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> Selah. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> But you, <span

<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> with my voice, and he answers me out
of his holy hill. Selah. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> I laid myself
down and slept. I awakened, for the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>
sustains me. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> I will not be afraid of
tens of thousands of people who have set themselves against me on every
side. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> Arise, <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>! Save me, my God! For you have struck all
of my enemies on the cheek bone. You have broken the teeth of the
wicked. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> Salvation belongs to the <span

<p><em>For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments. A Psalm by
David.</em><br />
<span class="bibleverse">1</span> Answer me when I call, God of my
righteousness. Give me relief from my distress. Have mercy on me, and
hear my prayer. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> You sons of men, how
long shall my glory be turned into dishonour? Will you love vanity and
seek after falsehood? Selah. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> But know
that the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> has set apart for himself
him who is godly; The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> will hear when
I call to him. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> Stand in awe, and don’t
sin. Search your own heart on your bed, and be still. Selah. <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> Offer the sacrifices of righteousness. Put
your trust in the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> Many say, “Who will show us any good?” <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, let the light of your face shine on us.
<span class="bibleverse">7</span> You have put gladness in my heart,

sleep, for you alone, the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, make me

<h1 id="section-4">5</h1>
<p><em>For the Chief Musician, with the flutes. A Psalm by
David.</em><br />
<span class="bibleverse">1</span> Give ear to my words, <span

class="bibleverse">2</span> Listen to the voice of my cry, my King and
my God, for I pray to you. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, in the morning you will hear my voice. In
the morning I will lay my requests before you, and will watch
expectantly. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> For you are not a God who
has pleasure in wickedness. Evil can’t live with you. <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> The arrogant will not stand in your sight.
You hate all workers of iniquity. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> You
will destroy those who speak lies. The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> abhors the bloodthirsty and deceitful man.
<span class="bibleverse">7</span> But as for me, in the abundance of
your loving kindness I will come into your house. I will bow towards
your holy temple in reverence of you. <span class="bibleverse">8</span>
Lead me, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, in your righteousness
because of my enemies. Make your way straight before my face. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> For there is no faithfulness in their mouth.
Their heart is destruction. Their throat is an open tomb. They flatter
with their tongue. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> Hold them guilty,
God. Let them fall by their own counsels. Thrust them out in the
multitude of their transgressions, for they have rebelled against you.
<span class="bibleverse">11</span> But let all those who take refuge in
you rejoice. Let them always shout for joy, because you defend them. Let
them also who love your name be joyful in you. <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> For you will bless the righteous. <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, you will surround him with favour as with
a shield.</p>

<p><em>For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments, upon the
eight-stringed lyre. A Psalm by David.</em><br />
<span class="bibleverse">1</span> <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>,
don’t rebuke me in your anger, neither discipline me in your wrath.
<span class="bibleverse">2</span> Have mercy on me, <span

<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>—how long? <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> Return, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>.
Deliver my soul, and save me for your loving kindness’ sake. <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> For in death there is no memory of you. In
Sheol,<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> who shall give you thanks? <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> I am weary with my groaning. Every night I
flood my bed. I drench my couch with my tears. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> My eye wastes away because of grief. It
grows old because of all my adversaries. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity,
for the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> has heard the voice of my
weeping. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> The <span

<p><em>A meditation by David, which he sang to the <span

<span class="bibleverse">1</span> <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>,
my God, I take refuge in you. Save me from all those who pursue me, and
deliver me, <span class="bibleverse">2</span> lest they tear apart my

deliver. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> <span

iniquity in my hands, <span class="bibleverse">4</span> if I have
rewarded evil to him who was at peace with me (yes, I have delivered him
who without cause was my adversary), <span class="bibleverse">5</span>
let the enemy pursue my soul, and overtake it; yes, let him tread my
life down to the earth, and lay my glory in the dust. Selah. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> Arise, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>,
in your anger. Lift up yourself against the rage of my adversaries.
Awake for me. You have commanded judgement. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> Let the congregation of the peoples surround
you. Rule over them on high. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> The <span

Judge me, <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, according to my
righteousness, and to my integrity that is in me. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to
an end, but establish the righteous; their minds and hearts are searched
by the righteous God. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> My shield is
with God, who saves the upright in heart. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> God is a righteous judge, yes, a God who
has indignation every day. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> If a man
doesn’t repent, he will sharpen his sword; he has bent and strung his
bow. <span class="bibleverse">13</span> He has also prepared for himself
the instruments of death. He makes ready his flaming arrows. <span

iniquity. Yes, he has conceived mischief, and brought out falsehood.

trouble he causes shall return to his own head. His violence shall come
down on the crown of his own head. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> I

our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth! You have set your
glory above the heavens! <span class="bibleverse">2</span> From the lips

crowned him with glory and honour. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> You

maintained my just cause. You sit on the throne judging righteously.
<span class="bibleverse">5</span> You have rebuked the nations. You have
destroyed the wicked. You have blotted out their name forever and ever.
<span class="bibleverse">6</span> The enemy is overtaken by endless
ruin. The very memory of the cities which you have overthrown has
perished. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> But the <span

no trouble.” <span class="bibleverse">7</span> His mouth is full of
cursing, deceit, and oppression. Under his tongue is mischief and

He catches the helpless when he draws him in his net. <span

condemn God, and say in his heart, “God won’t call me into account?”
<span class="bibleverse">14</span> But you do see trouble and grief. You
consider it to take it into your hand. You help the victim and the

none. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> The <span

perish out of his land. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> <span

up their callous hearts. With their mouth they speak proudly. <span

his enemies, and from the hand of Saul. He said,</em><br />
<span class="bibleverse">1</span> I love you, <span

my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my rock, in whom I take
refuge; my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower. <span

saved from my enemies. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> The cords of
death surrounded me. The floods of ungodliness made me afraid. <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> The cords of Sheol<a href="#fn11"

were around me. The snares of death came on me. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> In my distress I called on the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and cried to my God. He heard my voice
out of his temple. My cry before him came into his ears. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> Then the earth shook and trembled. The
foundations also of the mountains quaked and were shaken, because he was
angry. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> Smoke went out of his nostrils.
Consuming fire came out of his mouth. Coals were kindled by it. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> He bowed the heavens also, and came down.
Thick darkness was under his feet. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> He
rode on a cherub, and flew. Yes, he soared on the wings of the wind.
<span class="bibleverse">11</span> He made darkness his hiding place,
his pavilion around him, darkness of waters, thick clouds of the skies.
<span class="bibleverse">12</span> At the brightness before him his
thick clouds passed, hailstones and coals of fire. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>
also thundered in the sky. The Most High uttered his voice: hailstones
and coals of fire. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> He sent out his
arrows, and scattered them. He routed them with great lightning bolts.
<span class="bibleverse">15</span> Then the channels of waters appeared.
The foundations of the world were laid bare at your rebuke, <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, at the blast of the breath of your
nostrils. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> He sent from on high. He
took me. He drew me out of many waters. <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> He delivered me from my strong enemy, from
those who hated me; for they were too mighty for me. <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> They came on me in the day of my calamity,
but the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> was my support. <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> He brought me out also into a large place.
He delivered me, because he delighted in me. <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> has
rewarded me according to my righteousness. According to the cleanness of
my hands, he has recompensed me. <span class="bibleverse">21</span> For
I have kept the ways of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and
have not wickedly departed from my God. <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> For all his ordinances were before me. I
didn’t put away his statutes from me. <span class="bibleverse">23</span>
I was also blameless with him. I kept myself from my iniquity. <span

righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.
<span class="bibleverse">25</span> With the merciful you will show
yourself merciful. With the perfect man, you will show yourself perfect.
<span class="bibleverse">26</span> With the pure, you will show yourself
pure. With the crooked you will show yourself shrewd. <span

my God, I leap over a wall. <span class="bibleverse">30</span> As for
God, his way is perfect. The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s word
is tried. He is a shield to all those who take refuge in him. <span
class="bibleverse">31</span> For who is God, except the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>? Who is a rock, besides our God, <span
class="bibleverse">32</span> the God who arms me with strength, and
makes my way perfect? <span class="bibleverse">33</span> He makes my
feet like deer’s feet, and sets me on my high places. <span
class="bibleverse">34</span> He teaches my hands to war, so that my arms
bend a bow of bronze. <span class="bibleverse">35</span> You have also
given me the shield of your salvation. Your right hand sustains me. Your
gentleness has made me great. <span class="bibleverse">36</span> You
have enlarged my steps under me, My feet have not slipped. <span
class="bibleverse">37</span> I will pursue my enemies, and overtake
them. I won’t turn away until they are consumed. <span
class="bibleverse">38</span> I will strike them through, so that they
will not be able to rise. They shall fall under my feet. <span
class="bibleverse">39</span> For you have armed me with strength to the
battle. You have subdued under me those who rose up against me. <span
class="bibleverse">40</span> You have also made my enemies turn their
backs to me, that I might cut off those who hate me. <span
class="bibleverse">41</span> They cried, but there was no one to save;
even to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, but he didn’t answer
them. <span class="bibleverse">42</span> Then I beat them small as the
dust before the wind. I cast them out as the mire of the streets. <span
class="bibleverse">43</span> You have delivered me from the strivings of
the people. You have made me the head of the nations. A people whom I
have not known shall serve me. <span class="bibleverse">44</span> As
soon as they hear of me they shall obey me. The foreigners shall submit
themselves to me. <span class="bibleverse">45</span> The foreigners
shall fade away, and shall come trembling out of their strongholds.
<span class="bibleverse">46</span> The <span

God of my salvation, <span class="bibleverse">47</span> even the God who
executes vengeance for me, and subdues peoples under me. <span

<p><em>A Psalm by Asaph.</em><br />
<span class="bibleverse">1</span> The Mighty One, God, The <span

to sunset. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> Out of Zion, the perfection
of beauty, God shines out. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> Our God
comes, and does not keep silent. A fire devours before him. It is very
stormy around him. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> He calls to the

have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.” <span

“Hear, my people, and I will speak. Israel, I will testify against you.
I am God, your God. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> I don’t rebuke you
for your sacrifices. Your burnt offerings are continually before me.
<span class="bibleverse">9</span> I have no need for a bull from your
stall, nor male goats from your pens. <span class="bibleverse">10</span>
For every animal of the forest is mine, and the livestock on a thousand
hills. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> I know all the birds of the
mountains. The wild animals of the field are mine. <span

the world is mine, and all that is in it. <span

sacrifice of thanksgiving. Pay your vows to the Most High. <span

deliver you, and you will honour me.” <span class="bibleverse">16</span>
But to the wicked God says, “What right do you have to declare my
statutes, that you have taken my covenant on your lips, <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> since you hate instruction, and throw my
words behind you? <span class="bibleverse">18</span> When you saw a
thief, you consented with him, and have participated with adulterers.

tongue frames deceit. <span class="bibleverse">20</span> You sit and
speak against your brother. You slander your own mother’s son. <span

silent. You thought that I was just like you. I will rebuke you, and
accuse you in front of your eyes. <span class="bibleverse">22</span>
“Now consider this, you who forget God, lest I tear you into pieces, and
there be no one to deliver. <span class="bibleverse">23</span> Whoever
offers the sacrifice of thanksgiving glorifies me, and prepares his way
so that I will show God’s salvation to him.”</p>

deeds— awesome work on behalf of the children of men. <span

through the river on foot. There, we rejoiced in him. <span

watch the nations. Don’t let the rebellious rise up against him. Selah.
<span class="bibleverse">8</span> Praise our God, you peoples! Make the
sound of his praise heard, <span class="bibleverse">9</span> who
preserves our life amongst the living, and doesn’t allow our feet to be
moved. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> For you, God, have tested us.
You have refined us, as silver is refined. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> You brought us into prison. You laid a
burden on our backs. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> You allowed men
to ride over our heads. We went through fire and through water, but you
brought us to the place of abundance. <span class="bibleverse">13</span>
I will come into your temple with burnt offerings. I will pay my vows to
you, <span class="bibleverse">14</span> which my lips promised, and my
mouth spoke, when I was in distress. <span class="bibleverse">15</span>
I will offer to you burnt offerings of fat animals, with the offering of
rams, I will offer bulls with goats. Selah. <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> Come and hear, all you who fear God. I will
declare what he has done for my soul. <span class="bibleverse">17</span>
I cried to him with my mouth. He was extolled with my tongue. <span

wouldn’t have listened. <span class="bibleverse">19</span> But most
certainly, God has listened. He has heard the voice of my prayer. <span

prayer, nor his loving kindness from me.</p>

prepared your goodness for the poor. <span class="bibleverse">11</span>

people, yes, amongst the rebellious also, that the <span

death. <span class="bibleverse">21</span> But God will strike through
the head of his enemies, the hairy scalp of such a one as still
continues in his guiltiness. <span class="bibleverse">22</span> The Lord
said, “I will bring you again from Bashan, I will bring you again from
the depths of the sea, <span class="bibleverse">23</span> that you may
crush them, dipping your foot in blood, that the tongues of your dogs
may have their portion from your enemies.” <span
class="bibleverse">24</span> They have seen your processions, God, even

followed after, amongst the ladies playing with tambourines, <span

There is little Benjamin, their ruler, the princes of Judah, their

shall bring presents to you. <span class="bibleverse">30</span> Rebuke
the wild animal of the reeds, the multitude of the bulls with the calves
of the peoples. Trample under foot the bars of silver. Scatter the
nations who delight in war. <span class="bibleverse">31</span> Princes

those who wait for you be shamed through me, Lord GOD of Armies. Don’t

borne reproach. Shame has covered my face. <span

Draw near to my soul and redeem it. Ransom me because of my enemies.

persecute him whom you have wounded. They tell of the sorrow of those

praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with

envious of the arrogant, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked. <span

but their strength is firm. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> They are
free from burdens of men, neither are they plagued like other men. <span

the limits of conceit. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> They scoff and
speak with malice. In arrogance, they threaten oppression. <span

Their tongue walks through the earth. <span class="bibleverse">10</span>
Therefore their people return to them, and they drink up waters of

through a thicket of trees. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> Now they
break all its carved work down with hatchet and hammers. <span

You gave him as food to people and desert creatures. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> You opened up spring and stream. You dried
up mighty rivers. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> The day is yours,
the night is also yours. You have prepared the light and the sun. <span

My hand was stretched out in the night, and didn’t get tired. My soul

God, and I groan. I complain, and my spirit is overwhelmed. Selah. <span

favourable no more? <span class="bibleverse">8</span> Has his loving
kindness vanished forever? Does his promise fail for generations? <span

<h1 id="section-77">78</h1>
<p><em>A contemplation by Asaph.</em><br />
<span class="bibleverse">1</span> Hear my teaching, my people. Turn your
ears to the words of my mouth. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> I will
open my mouth in a parable. I will utter dark sayings of old, <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> which we have heard and known, and our
fathers have told us. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> We will not hide
them from their children, telling to the generation to come the praises
of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, his strength, and his
wondrous deeds that he has done. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> For
he established a covenant in Jacob, and appointed a teaching in Israel,
which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to
their children; <span class="bibleverse">6</span> that the generation to
come might know, even the children who should be born; who should arise
and tell their children, <span class="bibleverse">7</span> that they
might set their hope in God, and not forget God’s deeds, but keep his
commandments, <span class="bibleverse">8</span> and might not be as
their fathers— a stubborn and rebellious generation, a generation that
didn’t make their hearts loyal, whose spirit was not steadfast with God.
<span class="bibleverse">9</span> The children of Ephraim, being armed
and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> They didn’t keep God’s covenant, and
refused to walk in his law. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> They
forgot his doings, his wondrous deeds that he had shown them. <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> He did marvellous things in the sight of
their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> He split the sea, and caused them to pass
through. He made the waters stand as a heap. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> In the daytime he also led them with a
cloud, and all night with a light of fire. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> He split rocks in the wilderness, and gave
them drink abundantly as out of the depths. <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> He brought streams also out of the rock,
and caused waters to run down like rivers. <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> Yet they still went on to sin against him,
to rebel against the Most High in the desert. <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> They tempted God in their heart by asking
food according to their desire. <span class="bibleverse">19</span> Yes,
they spoke against God. They said, “Can God prepare a table in the
wilderness? <span class="bibleverse">20</span> Behold, he struck the
rock, so that waters gushed out, and streams overflowed. Can he give
bread also? Will he provide meat for his people?” <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> Therefore the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> heard, and was angry. A fire was kindled
against Jacob, anger also went up against Israel, <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> because they didn’t believe in God, and
didn’t trust in his salvation. <span class="bibleverse">23</span> Yet he
commanded the skies above, and opened the doors of heaven. <span
class="bibleverse">24</span> He rained down manna on them to eat, and
gave them food from the sky. <span class="bibleverse">25</span> Man ate
the bread of angels. He sent them food to the full. <span
class="bibleverse">26</span> He caused the east wind to blow in the sky.
By his power he guided the south wind. <span
class="bibleverse">27</span> He also rained meat on them as the dust,
winged birds as the sand of the seas. <span class="bibleverse">28</span>
He let them fall in the middle of their camp, around their habitations.
<span class="bibleverse">29</span> So they ate, and were well filled. He
gave them their own desire. <span class="bibleverse">30</span> They
didn’t turn from their cravings. Their food was yet in their mouths,
<span class="bibleverse">31</span> when the anger of God went up against
them, killed some of their strongest, and struck down the young men of
Israel. <span class="bibleverse">32</span> For all this they still
sinned, and didn’t believe in his wondrous works. <span
class="bibleverse">33</span> Therefore he consumed their days in vanity,
and their years in terror. <span class="bibleverse">34</span> When he
killed them, then they enquired after him. They returned and sought God
earnestly. <span class="bibleverse">35</span> They remembered that God
was their rock, the Most High God, their redeemer. <span
class="bibleverse">36</span> But they flattered him with their mouth,
and lied to him with their tongue. <span class="bibleverse">37</span>
For their heart was not right with him, neither were they faithful in
his covenant. <span class="bibleverse">38</span> But he, being merciful,
forgave iniquity, and didn’t destroy them. Yes, many times he turned his
anger away, and didn’t stir up all his wrath. <span
class="bibleverse">39</span> He remembered that they were but flesh, a
wind that passes away, and doesn’t come again. <span
class="bibleverse">40</span> How often they rebelled against him in the
wilderness, and grieved him in the desert! <span
class="bibleverse">41</span> They turned again and tempted God, and
provoked the Holy One of Israel. <span class="bibleverse">42</span> They
didn’t remember his hand, nor the day when he redeemed them from the
adversary; <span class="bibleverse">43</span> how he set his signs in
Egypt, his wonders in the field of Zoan, <span
class="bibleverse">44</span> he turned their rivers into blood, and
their streams, so that they could not drink. <span
class="bibleverse">45</span> He sent amongst them swarms of flies, which
devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them. <span
class="bibleverse">46</span> He also gave their increase to the
caterpillar, and their labour to the locust. <span
class="bibleverse">47</span> He destroyed their vines with hail, their
sycamore fig trees with frost. <span class="bibleverse">48</span> He
also gave over their livestock to the hail, and their flocks to hot
thunderbolts. <span class="bibleverse">49</span> He threw on them the
fierceness of his anger, wrath, indignation, and trouble, and a band of
angels of evil. <span class="bibleverse">50</span> He made a path for
his anger. He didn’t spare their soul from death, but gave their life
over to the pestilence, <span class="bibleverse">51</span> and struck
all the firstborn in Egypt, the chief of their strength in the tents of
Ham. <span class="bibleverse">52</span> But he led out his own people
like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock. <span
class="bibleverse">53</span> He led them safely, so that they weren’t
afraid, but the sea overwhelmed their enemies. <span
class="bibleverse">54</span> He brought them to the border of his
sanctuary, to this mountain, which his right hand had taken. <span
class="bibleverse">55</span> He also drove out the nations before them,
allotted them for an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel
to dwell in their tents. <span class="bibleverse">56</span> Yet they
tempted and rebelled against the Most High God, and didn’t keep his
testimonies, <span class="bibleverse">57</span> but turned back, and
dealt treacherously like their fathers. They were twisted like a
deceitful bow. <span class="bibleverse">58</span> For they provoked him
to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their
engraved images. <span class="bibleverse">59</span> When God heard this,
he was angry, and greatly abhorred Israel, <span
class="bibleverse">60</span> so that he abandoned the tent of Shiloh,
the tent which he placed amongst men, <span class="bibleverse">61</span>
and delivered his strength into captivity, his glory into the
adversary’s hand. <span class="bibleverse">62</span> He also gave his
people over to the sword, and was angry with his inheritance. <span
class="bibleverse">63</span> Fire devoured their young men. Their
virgins had no wedding song. <span class="bibleverse">64</span> Their
priests fell by the sword, and their widows couldn’t weep. <span
class="bibleverse">65</span> Then the Lord awakened as one out of sleep,
like a mighty man who shouts by reason of wine. <span
class="bibleverse">66</span> He struck his adversaries backward. He put
them to a perpetual reproach. <span class="bibleverse">67</span>
Moreover he rejected the tent of Joseph, and didn’t choose the tribe of
Ephraim, <span class="bibleverse">68</span> But chose the tribe of
Judah, Mount Zion which he loved. <span class="bibleverse">69</span> He
built his sanctuary like the heights, like the earth which he has
established forever. <span class="bibleverse">70</span> He also chose
David his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds; <span
class="bibleverse">71</span> from following the ewes that have their
young, he brought him to be the shepherd of Jacob, his people, and
Israel, his inheritance. <span class="bibleverse">72</span> So he was
their shepherd according to the integrity of his heart, and guided them
by the skilfulness of his hands.</p>

like a sparrow that is alone on the housetop. <span

are mad at me use my name as a curse. <span class="bibleverse">9</span>
For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mixed my drink with tears, <span

fire. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> He laid the foundations of the

your thunder they hurried away. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> The
mountains rose, the valleys sank down, to the place which you had

sing amongst the branches. <span class="bibleverse">13</span> He waters
the mountains from his rooms. The earth is filled with the fruit of your

the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance,” <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> when they were but a few men in number,
yes, very few, and foreigners in it. <span class="bibleverse">13</span>
They went about from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another
people. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> He allowed no one to do them
wrong. Yes, he reproved kings for their sakes, <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> “Don’t touch my anointed ones! Do my
prophets no harm!” <span class="bibleverse">16</span> He called for a
famine on the land. He destroyed the food supplies. <span

with shackles. His neck was locked in irons, <span

the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s word proved him true. <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> The king sent and freed him, even the ruler

made him lord of his house, and ruler of all of his possessions, <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> to discipline his princes at his pleasure,
and to teach his elders wisdom. <span class="bibleverse">23</span>
Israel also came into Egypt. Jacob lived in the land of Ham. <span
class="bibleverse">24</span> He increased his people greatly, and made
them stronger than their adversaries. <span class="bibleverse">25</span>
He turned their heart to hate his people, to conspire against his
servants. <span class="bibleverse">26</span> He sent Moses, his servant,
and Aaron, whom he had chosen. <span class="bibleverse">27</span> They
performed miracles amongst them, and wonders in the land of Ham. <span
class="bibleverse">28</span> He sent darkness, and made it dark. They
didn’t rebel against his words. <span class="bibleverse">29</span> He
turned their waters into blood, and killed their fish. <span
class="bibleverse">30</span> Their land swarmed with frogs, even in the
rooms of their kings. <span class="bibleverse">31</span> He spoke, and
swarms of flies came, and lice in all their borders. <span
class="bibleverse">32</span> He gave them hail for rain, with lightning
in their land. <span class="bibleverse">33</span> He struck their vines
and also their fig trees, and shattered the trees of their country.
<span class="bibleverse">34</span> He spoke, and the locusts came with
the grasshoppers, without number. <span class="bibleverse">35</span>
They ate up every plant in their land, and ate up the fruit of their
ground. <span class="bibleverse">36</span> He struck also all the
firstborn in their land, the first fruits of all their manhood. <span
class="bibleverse">37</span> He brought them out with silver and gold.
There was not one feeble person amongst his tribes. <span
class="bibleverse">38</span> Egypt was glad when they departed, for the
fear of them had fallen on them. <span class="bibleverse">39</span> He
spread a cloud for a covering, fire to give light in the night. <span
class="bibleverse">40</span> They asked, and he brought quails, and
satisfied them with the bread of the sky. <span
class="bibleverse">41</span> He opened the rock, and waters gushed out.
They ran as a river in the dry places. <span
class="bibleverse">42</span> For he remembered his holy word, and
Abraham, his servant. <span class="bibleverse">43</span> He brought his
people out with joy, his chosen with singing. <span
class="bibleverse">44</span> He gave them the lands of the nations. They

that I may see the prosperity of your chosen, that I may rejoice in the
gladness of your nation, that I may glory with your inheritance. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> We have sinned with our fathers. We have
committed iniquity. We have done wickedly. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> Our fathers didn’t understand your wonders
in Egypt. They didn’t remember the multitude of your loving kindnesses,
but were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> Nevertheless he saved them for his name’s
sake, that he might make his mighty power known. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was
dried up; so he led them through the depths, as through a desert. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> He saved them from the hand of him who
hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> The waters covered their adversaries. There
was not one of them left. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> Then they
believed his words. They sang his praise. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> They soon forgot his works. They didn’t
wait for his counsel, <span class="bibleverse">14</span> but gave in to
craving in the desert, and tested God in the wasteland. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> He gave them their request, but sent
leanness into their soul. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> They envied
Moses also in the camp, and Aaron, the <span

class="bibleverse">17</span> The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan,
and covered the company of Abiram. <span class="bibleverse">18</span> A
fire was kindled in their company. The flame burnt up the wicked. <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped a
molten image. <span class="bibleverse">20</span> Thus they exchanged
their glory for an image of a bull that eats grass. <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> They forgot God, their Saviour, who had
done great things in Egypt, <span class="bibleverse">22</span> wondrous
works in the land of Ham, and awesome things by the Red Sea. <span
class="bibleverse">23</span> Therefore he said that he would destroy
them, had Moses, his chosen, not stood before him in the breach, to turn
away his wrath, so that he wouldn’t destroy them. <span
class="bibleverse">24</span> Yes, they despised the pleasant land. They
didn’t believe his word, <span class="bibleverse">25</span> but murmured
in their tents, and didn’t listen to the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s voice. <span
class="bibleverse">26</span> Therefore he swore to them that he would
overthrow them in the wilderness, <span class="bibleverse">27</span>
that he would overthrow their offspring amongst the nations, and scatter
them in the lands. <span class="bibleverse">28</span> They joined
themselves also to Baal Peor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead. <span
class="bibleverse">29</span> Thus they provoked him to anger with their
deeds. The plague broke in on them. <span class="bibleverse">30</span>
Then Phinehas stood up and executed judgement, so the plague was
stopped. <span class="bibleverse">31</span> That was credited to him for
righteousness, for all generations to come. <span
class="bibleverse">32</span> They angered him also at the waters of
Meribah, so that Moses was troubled for their sakes; <span
class="bibleverse">33</span> because they were rebellious against his
spirit, he spoke rashly with his lips. <span
class="bibleverse">34</span> They didn’t destroy the peoples, as the
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> commanded them, <span
class="bibleverse">35</span> but mixed themselves with the nations, and
learnt their works. <span class="bibleverse">36</span> They served their
idols, which became a snare to them. <span class="bibleverse">37</span>
Yes, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons. <span
class="bibleverse">38</span> They shed innocent blood, even the blood of
their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of
Canaan. The land was polluted with blood. <span
class="bibleverse">39</span> Thus they were defiled with their works,
and prostituted themselves in their deeds. <span
class="bibleverse">40</span> Therefore the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> burnt with anger against his people. He
abhorred his inheritance. <span class="bibleverse">41</span> He gave
them into the hand of the nations. Those who hated them ruled over them.
<span class="bibleverse">42</span> Their enemies also oppressed them.
They were brought into subjection under their hand. <span
class="bibleverse">43</span> He rescued them many times, but they were
rebellious in their counsel, and were brought low in their iniquity.
<span class="bibleverse">44</span> Nevertheless he regarded their
distress, when he heard their cry. <span class="bibleverse">45</span> He
remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the
multitude of his loving kindnesses. <span class="bibleverse">46</span>
He made them also to be pitied by all those who carried them captive.
<span class="bibleverse">47</span> Save us, <span

nations, to give thanks to your holy name, to triumph in your praise!
<span class="bibleverse">48</span> Blessed be the <span

Let the redeemed by the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> say so, whom
he has redeemed from the hand of the adversary, <span

and from the west, from the north and from the south. <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> They wandered in the wilderness in a desert

Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them. <span

satisfies the longing soul. He fills the hungry soul with good. <span

death, being bound in affliction and iron, <span

God,<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a> and condemned the counsel of the
Most High. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> Therefore he brought down
their heart with labour. They fell down, and there was no one to help.
<span class="bibleverse">13</span> Then they cried to the <span

their distresses. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> He brought them out
of darkness and the shadow of death, and broke away their chains. <span

draw near to the gates of death. <span class="bibleverse">19</span> Then
they cry to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> in their trouble,

delivers them from their graves. <span class="bibleverse">21</span> Let
them praise the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> for his loving

do business in great waters, <span class="bibleverse">24</span> these
see the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s deeds, and his wonders in
the deep. <span class="bibleverse">25</span> For he commands, and raises
the stormy wind, which lifts up its waves. <span
class="bibleverse">26</span> They mount up to the sky; they go down
again to the depths. Their soul melts away because of trouble. <span
class="bibleverse">27</span> They reel back and forth, and stagger like
a drunken man, and are at their wits’ end. <span
class="bibleverse">28</span> Then they cry to the <span

of their distress. <span class="bibleverse">29</span> He makes the storm
a calm, so that its waves are still. <span class="bibleverse">30</span>
Then they are glad because it is calm, so he brings them to their
desired haven. <span class="bibleverse">31</span> Let them praise the
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> for his loving kindness, for his
wonderful deeds for the children of men! <span
class="bibleverse">32</span> Let them exalt him also in the assembly of
the people, and praise him in the seat of the elders. <span
class="bibleverse">33</span> He turns rivers into a desert, water
springs into a thirsty ground, <span class="bibleverse">34</span> and a
fruitful land into a salt waste, for the wickedness of those who dwell
in it. <span class="bibleverse">35</span> He turns a desert into a pool
of water, and a dry land into water springs. <span
class="bibleverse">36</span> There he makes the hungry live, that they
may prepare a city to live in, <span class="bibleverse">37</span> sow
fields, plant vineyards, and reap the fruits of increase. <span
class="bibleverse">38</span> He blesses them also, so that they are
multiplied greatly. He doesn’t allow their livestock to decrease. <span
class="bibleverse">39</span> Again, they are diminished and bowed down
through oppression, trouble, and sorrow. <span
class="bibleverse">40</span> He pours contempt on princes, and causes
them to wander in a trackless waste. <span class="bibleverse">41</span>
Yet he lifts the needy out of their affliction, and increases their
families like a flock. <span class="bibleverse">42</span> The upright
will see it, and be glad. All the wicked will shut their mouths. <span
class="bibleverse">43</span> Whoever is wise will pay attention to these
things. They will consider the loving kindnesses of the <span

his people from this time forward and forever more. <span

<span class="bibleverse">1</span> When the <span

we were like those who dream. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> Then our
