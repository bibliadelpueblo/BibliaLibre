<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> In the second year of Darius the
king, in the sixth month, in the first day of the month, the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> word came by Haggai the
prophet, to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to
Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, saying, <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> “This is what the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> of Armies says: These people say, ‘The
time hasn’t yet come, the time for the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s house to be built.’” <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> Then the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s word came by Haggai the prophet, saying,
<span class="bibleverse">4</span> “Is it a time for you yourselves to
dwell in your panelled houses, while this house lies waste? <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> Now therefore this is what the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> of Armies says: ‘Consider your ways. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> You have sown much, and bring in little. You
eat, but you don’t have enough. You drink, but you aren’t filled with
drink. You clothe yourselves, but no one is warm; and he who earns wages
earns wages to put them into a bag with holes in it.’ <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> “This is what the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> of Armies says: ‘Consider your ways. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> Go up to the mountain, bring wood, and build
the house. I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified,” says
the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> “You looked for much, and, behold,<a
href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> it came to little; and when you
brought it home, I blew it away. Why?” says the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> of Armies, “Because of my house that lies
waste, while each of you is busy with his own house. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> Therefore for your sake the heavens
withhold the dew, and the earth withholds its fruit. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> I called for a drought on the land, on the
mountains, on the grain, on the new wine, on the oil, on that which the
ground produces, on men, on livestock, and on all the labour of the
hands.” <span class="bibleverse">12</span> Then Zerubbabel the son of
Shealtiel and Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, with all the
remnant of the people, obeyed the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>
their God’s<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> voice, and the words of Haggai the
prophet, as the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> their God, had sent
him; and the people feared the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>.
<span class="bibleverse">13</span> Then Haggai, the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s messenger, spoke the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s message to the people, saying, “I am
with you,” says the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>
stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of
Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest,
and the spirit of all the remnant of the people; and they came and
worked on the house of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> of
Armies, their God, <span class="bibleverse">15</span> in the
twenty-fourth day of the month, in the sixth month, in the second year
of Darius the king.</p>

of the future glory of the new temple</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> In the seventh month, in the
twenty-first day of the month, the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s
word came by Haggai the prophet, saying, <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> “Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of
Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the
high priest, and to the remnant of the people, saying, <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> ‘Who is left amongst you who saw this house
in its former glory? How do you see it now? Isn’t it in your eyes as
nothing? <span class="bibleverse">4</span> Yet now be strong,
Zerubbabel,’ says the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. ‘Be strong,
Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest. Be strong, all you people of
the land,’ says the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, ‘and work, for
I am with you,’ says the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> of Armies.
<span class="bibleverse">5</span> This is the word that I covenanted
with you when you came out of Egypt, and my Spirit lived amongst you.
‘Don’t be afraid.’ <span class="bibleverse">6</span> For this is what
the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> of Armies says: ‘Yet once more,
it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens, the earth, the sea,
and the dry land; <span class="bibleverse">7</span> and I will shake all
nations. The treasure of all nations will come, and I will fill this
house with glory, says the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> of
Armies. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> The silver is mine, and the
gold is mine,’ says the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> of Armies.
<span class="bibleverse">9</span> ‘The latter glory of this house will
be greater than the former,’ says the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> of Armies; ‘and in this place I will give
peace,’ says the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> of Armies.”</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">10</span> In the twenty-fourth day of the
ninth month, in the second year of Darius, the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s word came by Haggai the prophet, saying,
<span class="bibleverse">11</span> “The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> of Armies says: Ask now the priests
concerning the law, saying, <span class="bibleverse">12</span> ‘If
someone carries holy meat in the fold of his garment, and with his fold
touches bread, stew, wine, oil, or any food, will it become holy?’” The
priests answered, “No.” <span class="bibleverse">13</span> Then Haggai
said, “If one who is unclean by reason of a dead body touch any of
these, will it be unclean?” The priests answered, “It will be unclean.”
<span class="bibleverse">14</span> Then Haggai answered, “‘So is this
people, and so is this nation before me,’ says the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>; ‘and so is every work of their hands.
That which they offer there is unclean.</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">15</span> Now, please consider from this day
and backward, before a stone was laid on a stone in the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s temple. <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> Through all that time, when one came to a
heap of twenty measures, there were only ten. When one came to the wine
vat to draw out fifty, there were only twenty. <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> I struck you with blight, mildew, and hail
in all the work of your hands; yet you didn’t turn to me,’ says the
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. <span class="bibleverse">18</span>
‘Consider, please, from this day and backward, from the twenty-fourth
day of the ninth month, since the day that the foundation of the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s temple was laid, consider it. <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> Is the seed yet in the barn? Yes, the vine,
the fig tree, the pomegranate, and the olive tree haven’t produced. From
today I will bless you.’”</p>

fall of pagan kingdoms and the promise of Zerubbabel's exaltation</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">20</span> The <span

the twenty-fourth day of the month, saying, <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> “Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah,
saying, ‘I will shake the heavens and the earth. <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms. I
will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations. I will
overthrow the chariots and those who ride in them. The horses and their
riders will come down, everyone by the sword of his brother. <span

servant, the son of Shealtiel,’ says the <span
