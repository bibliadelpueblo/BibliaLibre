<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Paul, a servant of God and an
apostle of Jesus Christ,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> according to the faith of God’s
chosen ones and the knowledge of the truth which is according to
godliness, <span class="bibleverse">2</span> in hope of eternal life,
which God, who can’t lie, promised before time began; <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> but in his own time revealed his word in the
message with which I was entrusted according to the commandment of God
our Saviour, <span class="bibleverse">4</span> to Titus, my true child
according to a common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father
and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.</p>
<h2
id="regulations-governing-the-appointment-of-elders-as-church-leaders">Regulations
Governing the Appointment of Elders as Church Leaders</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">5</span> I left you in Crete for this
reason, that you would set in order the things that were lacking and
appoint elders in every city, as I directed you— <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> if anyone is blameless, the husband of one
wife, having children who believe, who are not accused of loose or
unruly behaviour. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> For the overseer
must be blameless, as God’s steward, not self-pleasing, not easily
angered, not given to wine, not violent, not greedy for dishonest gain;
<span class="bibleverse">8</span> but given to hospitality, a lover of
good, sober minded, fair, holy, self-controlled, <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> holding to the faithful word which is
according to the teaching, that he may be able to exhort in the sound
doctrine, and to convict those who contradict him.</p>
<h2
id="rules-of-conduct-against-malicious-seducers-and-hypocritical-false-teachers">Rules
of conduct against malicious seducers and hypocritical false
teachers</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">10</span> For there are also many unruly
men, vain talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision,
<span class="bibleverse">11</span> whose mouths must be stopped: men who
overthrow whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for
dishonest gain’s sake. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> One of them, a
prophet of their own, said, “Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, and
idle gluttons.” <span class="bibleverse">13</span> This testimony is
true. For this cause, reprove them sharply, that they may be sound in
the faith, <span class="bibleverse">14</span> not paying attention to
Jewish fables and commandments of men who turn away from the truth.
<span class="bibleverse">15</span> To the pure, all things are pure, but
to those who are defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure; but both
their mind and their conscience are defiled. <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> They profess that they know God, but by
their deeds they deny him, being abominable, disobedient, and unfit for
any good work.</p>
<h1 id="section-1">2</h1>
<h2 id="regulations-for-individual-farms-in-the-community">Regulations
for individual farms in the community</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> But say the things which fit sound
doctrine, <span class="bibleverse">2</span> that older men should be
temperate, sensible, sober minded, sound in faith, in love, and in
perseverance, <span class="bibleverse">3</span> and that older women
likewise be reverent in behaviour, not slanderers nor enslaved to much
wine, teachers of that which is good, <span class="bibleverse">4</span>
that they may train the young wives to love their husbands, to love
their children, <span class="bibleverse">5</span> to be sober minded,
chaste, workers at home, kind, being in subjection to their own
husbands, that God’s word may not be blasphemed. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> Likewise, exhort the younger men to be sober
minded. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> In all things show yourself an
example of good works. In your teaching, show integrity, seriousness,
incorruptibility, <span class="bibleverse">8</span> and soundness of
speech that can’t be condemned, that he who opposes you may be ashamed,
having no evil thing to say about us. <span class="bibleverse">9</span>
Exhort servants to be in subjection to their own masters and to be
well-pleasing in all things, not contradicting, <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> not stealing, but showing all good
fidelity, that they may adorn the doctrine of God, our Saviour, in all
things.</p>
<h2
id="justification-of-these-regulations-referring-to-the-grace-of-god-that-appeared-in-the-world">Justification
of these regulations referring to the grace of God that appeared in the
world</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">11</span> For the grace of God has appeared,
bringing salvation to all men, <span class="bibleverse">12</span>
instructing us to the intent that, denying ungodliness and worldly
lusts, we would live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present
age; <span class="bibleverse">13</span> looking for the blessed hope and
appearing of the glory of our great God and Saviour, Jesus Christ, <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> who gave himself for us, that he might
redeem us from all iniquity and purify for himself a people for his own
possession, zealous for good works. <span class="bibleverse">15</span>
Say these things and exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no one
despise you.</p>
<h1 id="section-2">3</h1>
<h2
id="on-behavior-against-pagan-authorities-and-non-christians-and-on-the-path-of-christians-as-a-renewed-people">On
behavior against pagan authorities and non-Christians and on the path of
Christians as a renewed people</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Remind them to be in subjection to
rulers and to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good
work, <span class="bibleverse">2</span> to speak evil of no one, not to
be contentious, to be gentle, showing all humility towards all men.
<span class="bibleverse">3</span> For we were also once foolish,
disobedient, deceived, serving various lusts and pleasures, living in
malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another. <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> But when the kindness of God our Saviour and
his love towards mankind appeared, <span class="bibleverse">5</span> not
by works of righteousness which we did ourselves, but according to his
mercy, he saved us through the washing of regeneration and renewing by
the Holy Spirit, <span class="bibleverse">6</span> whom he poured out on
us richly through Jesus Christ our Saviour; <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> that being justified by his grace, we might
be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</p>
<h2
id="conclusion-on-behavior-in-the-face-of-doctrinal-aberrations-and-their-representatives">Conclusion
on behavior in the face of doctrinal aberrations and their
representatives</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">8</span> This saying is faithful, and
concerning these things I desire that you insist confidently, so that
those who have believed God may be careful to maintain good works. These
things are good and profitable to men; <span class="bibleverse">9</span>
but shun foolish questionings, genealogies, strife, and disputes about
the law; for they are unprofitable and vain. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> Avoid a factious man after a first and
second warning, <span class="bibleverse">11</span> knowing that such a
one is perverted and sinful, being self-condemned.</p>
<h2 id="final-personal-comments-last-orders-and-greetings">Final
personal comments, last orders and greetings</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">12</span> When I send Artemas to you, or
Tychicus, be diligent to come to me to Nicopolis, for I have determined
to winter there. <span class="bibleverse">13</span> Send Zenas the
lawyer and Apollos on their journey speedily, that nothing may be
lacking for them. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> Let our people also
learn to maintain good works to meet necessary needs, that they may not
be unfruitful. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> All who are with me
greet you. Greet those who love us in faith. Grace be with you all.
Amen.</p>
