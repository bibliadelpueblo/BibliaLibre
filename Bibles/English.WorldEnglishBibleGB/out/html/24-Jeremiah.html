the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> had commanded him to speak to
all the people, the priests and the prophets and all the people seized
him, saying, “You shall surely die! <span class="bibleverse">9</span>
Why have you prophesied in the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s

the priests and to the prophets: “This man is not worthy of death; for
he has spoken to us in the name of the <span

up, and spoke to all the assembly of the people, saying, <span

him to death; but when Uriah heard it, he was afraid, and fled, and went

sent Elnathan the son of Achbor and certain men with him into Egypt.
<span class="bibleverse">23</span> They fetched Uriah out of Egypt and

make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from
following them, to do them good. I will put my fear in their hearts,

Yes, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in
this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul.” <span

and imprisonment of Jeremiah by a military officer</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">11</span> When the army of the Chaldeans had
withdrawn from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh’s army, <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> then Jeremiah went out of Jerusalem to go
into the land of Benjamin, to receive his portion there, in the middle
of the people. <span class="bibleverse">13</span> When he was in
Benjamin’s gate, a captain of the guard was there, whose name was
Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he seized
Jeremiah the prophet, saying, “You are defecting to the Chaldeans!”
<span class="bibleverse">14</span> Then Jeremiah said, “That is false! I
am not defecting to the Chaldeans.” But he didn’t listen to him; so
Irijah seized Jeremiah, and brought him to the princes. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> The princes were angry with Jeremiah, and
struck him, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe;
for they had made that the prison.</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">16</span> When Jeremiah had come into the
dungeon house and into the cells, and Jeremiah had remained there many
days, <span class="bibleverse">17</span> then Zedekiah the king sent and
had him brought out. The king asked him secretly in his house, “Is there
any word from the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>?” Jeremiah said,
“There is.” He also said, “You will be delivered into the hand of the
king of Babylon.” <span class="bibleverse">18</span> Moreover Jeremiah
said to king Zedekiah, “How have I sinned against you, against your
servants, or against this people, that you have put me in prison? <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> Now where are your prophets who prophesied
to you, saying, ‘The king of Babylon will not come against you, nor
against this land?’ <span class="bibleverse">20</span> Now please hear,
my lord the king: please let my supplication be presented before you,
that you not cause me to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe,
lest I die there.” <span class="bibleverse">21</span> Then Zedekiah the
king commanded, and they committed Jeremiah into the court of the guard.
They gave him daily a loaf of bread out of the bakers’ street, until all
the bread in the city was gone. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of
the guard.</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Shephatiah the son of Mattan,
Gedaliah the son of Pashhur, Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur the

saying, <span class="bibleverse">2</span> “The <span

die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, but he who goes
out to the Chaldeans will live. He will escape with his life and he will
live.’ <span class="bibleverse">3</span> The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> says, ‘This city will surely be given into
the hand of the army of the king of Babylon, and he will take it.’”
<span class="bibleverse">4</span> Then the princes said to the king,
“Please let this man be put to death, because he weakens the hands of
the men of war who remain in this city, and the hands of all the people,
in speaking such words to them; for this man doesn’t seek the welfare of
this people, but harm.” <span class="bibleverse">5</span> Zedekiah the
king said, “Behold, he is in your hand; for the king can’t do anything
to oppose you.” <span class="bibleverse">6</span> Then they took
Jeremiah and threw him into the dungeon of Malchijah the king’s son,
that was in the court of the guard. They let down Jeremiah with cords.
In the dungeon there was no water, but mire; and Jeremiah sank in the
mire.</p>
<h2 id="the-rescue-of-jeremiah-by-the-ethiopian-ebedmelec">The rescue of
Jeremiah by the Ethiopian Ebedmelec</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">7</span> Now when Ebedmelech the Ethiopian,
a eunuch, who was in the king’s house, heard that they had put Jeremiah
in the dungeon (the king was then sitting in Benjamin’s gate), <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> Ebedmelech went out of the king’s house, and
spoke to the king, saying, <span class="bibleverse">9</span> “My lord
the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to
Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon. He is likely
to die in the place where he is, because of the famine; for there is no
more bread in the city.” <span class="bibleverse">10</span> Then the
king commanded Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, “Take from here thirty
men with you, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon,
before he dies.” <span class="bibleverse">11</span> So Ebedmelech took
the men with him, and went into the house of the king under the
treasury, and took from there rags and worn-out garments, and let them
down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah. <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> Ebedmelech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah,
“Now put these rags and worn-out garments under your armpits under the
cords.” Jeremiah did so. <span class="bibleverse">13</span> So they
lifted Jeremiah up with the cords, and took him up out of the dungeon;
and Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.</p>
<h2 id="jeremiahs-last-secret-meeting-with-the-king">Jeremiah's last

<p><span class="bibleverse">14</span> Then Zedekiah the king sent and

Jeremiah, “I will ask you something. Hide nothing from me.” <span

declare it to you, will you not surely put me to death? If I give you
counsel, you will not listen to me.” <span class="bibleverse">16</span>
So Zedekiah the king swore secretly to Jeremiah, saying, “As the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> lives, who made our souls, I will not put
you to death, neither will I give you into the hand of these men who
seek your life.” <span class="bibleverse">17</span> Then Jeremiah said
to Zedekiah, “The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the God of
Armies, the God of Israel, says: ‘If you will go out to the king of
Babylon’s princes, then your soul will live, and this city will not be
burnt with fire. You will live, along with your house. <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> But if you will not go out to the king of
Babylon’s princes, then this city will be given into the hand of the
Chaldeans, and they will burn it with fire, and you won’t escape out of
their hand.’” <span class="bibleverse">19</span> Zedekiah the king said
to Jeremiah, “I am afraid of the Jews who have defected to the
Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they mock me.”
<span class="bibleverse">20</span> But Jeremiah said, “They won’t
deliver you. Obey, I beg you, the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s
voice, in that which I speak to you; so it will be well with you, and
your soul will live. <span class="bibleverse">21</span> But if you
refuse to go out, this is the word that the <span

class="bibleverse">22</span> ‘Behold, all the women who are left in the
king of Judah’s house will be brought out to the king of Babylon’s
princes, and those women will say, “Your familiar friends have turned on
you, and have prevailed over you. Your feet are sunk in the mire, they
have turned away from you.” <span class="bibleverse">23</span> They will
bring out all your wives and your children to the Chaldeans. You won’t
escape out of their hand, but will be taken by the hand of the king of
Babylon. You will cause this city to be burnt with fire.’”</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">24</span> Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah,
“Let no man know of these words, and you won’t die. <span
class="bibleverse">25</span> But if the princes hear that I have talked
with you, and they come to you, and tell you, ‘Declare to us now what
you have said to the king; don’t hide it from us, and we will not put
you to death; also tell us what the king said to you;’ <span
class="bibleverse">26</span> then you shall tell them, ‘I presented my
supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to return to
Jonathan’s house, to die there.’” <span class="bibleverse">27</span>
Then all the princes came to Jeremiah, and asked him; and he told them
according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they
stopped speaking with him, for the matter was not perceived. <span

army came against Jerusalem, and besieged it. <span

fourth month, the ninth day of the month, a breach was made in the city.
<span class="bibleverse">3</span> All the princes of the king of Babylon

Sarsechim, Rabsaris, Nergal Sharezer, Rabmag, with all the rest of the

Zedekiah the king of Judah and all the men of war saw them, then they
fled and went out of the city by night, by the way of the king’s garden,
through the gate between the two walls; and he went out towards the
Arabah. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> But the army of the Chaldeans
pursued them, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. When they
had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to
Riblah in the land of Hamath; and he pronounced judgement on him. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> Then the king of Babylon killed Zedekiah’s
sons in Riblah before his eyes. The king of Babylon also killed all the
nobles of Judah. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> Moreover he put out
Zedekiah’s eyes and bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> The Chaldeans burnt the king’s house and the
people’s houses with fire and broke down the walls of Jerusalem. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard
carried away captive into Babylon the rest of the people who remained in
the city, the deserters also who fell away to him, and the rest of the
people who remained. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> But Nebuzaradan
the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people, who had

<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> The word which came to Jeremiah
from the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, after Nebuzaradan the
captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he had taken him
being bound in chains amongst all the captives of Jerusalem and Judah
who were carried away captive to Babylon. <span

said to him, “The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> your God

and the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> has brought it, and done
according as he spoke. Because you have sinned against the <span

this thing has come on you. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> Now,
behold, I release you today from the chains which are on your hand. If
it seems good to you to come with me into Babylon, come, and I will take
care of you; but if it seems bad to you to come with me into Babylon,
don’t. Behold, all the land is before you. Where it seems good and right
to you to go, there go.” <span class="bibleverse">5</span> Now while he
had not yet gone back, “Go back then,” he said, “to Gedaliah the son of
Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has made governor
over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him amongst the people; or go
wherever it seems right to you to go.” So the captain of the guard gave
him food and a present, and let him go. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> Then Jeremiah went to Gedaliah the son of
Ahikam to Mizpah, and lived with him amongst the people who were left in
the land.</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">7</span> Now when all the captains of the

land, and had committed to him men, women, children, and of the poorest
of the land, of those who were not carried away captive to Babylon,
<span class="bibleverse">8</span> then Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and
Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of

me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah, to stand before the Chaldeans who
will come to us; but you, gather wine and summer fruits and oil, and put
them in your vessels, and dwell in your cities that you have taken.”
<span class="bibleverse">11</span> Likewise when all the Jews who were
in Moab, and amongst the children of Ammon, and in Edom, and who were in
all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of
Judah, and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son

<p><span class="bibleverse">13</span> Moreover Johanan the son of

him, “Do you know that Baalis the king of the children of Ammon has sent
Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to take your life?” But Gedaliah the son of
Ahikam didn’t believe them. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> Then
Johanan the son of Kareah spoke to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly, saying,
“Please let me go, and I will kill Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no
man will know it. Why should he take your life, that all the Jews who
are gathered to you should be scattered, and the remnant of Judah
perish?” <span class="bibleverse">16</span> But Gedaliah the son of

Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and there they ate bread together
in Mizpah. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> Then Ishmael the son of
Nethaniah arose, and the ten men who were with him, and struck Gedaliah

the king of Babylon had made governor over the land. <span

with meal offerings and frankincense in their hand, to bring them to the

class="bibleverse">6</span> Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went out from
Mizpah to meet them, weeping all along as he went, and as he met them,
he said to them, “Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.” <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> It was so, when they came into the middle of
the city, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah killed them, and cast them
into the middle of the pit, he, and the men who were with him. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> But ten men were found amongst those who
said to Ishmael, “Don’t kill us; for we have stores hidden in the field,
of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey.” So he stopped, and
didn’t kill them amongst their brothers. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> Now the pit in which Ishmael cast all the
dead bodies of the men whom he had killed, by the side of Gedaliah (this
was that which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel),
Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with those who were killed. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> Then Ishmael carried away captive all of
the people who were left in Mizpah, even the king’s daughters, and all
the people who remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the

Nethaniah carried them away captive, and departed to go over to the

fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and found him by the great
waters that are in Gibeon. <span class="bibleverse">13</span> Now when
all the people who were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah, and
all the captains of the forces who were with him, then they were glad.
<span class="bibleverse">14</span> So all the people who Ishmael had
carried away captive from Mizpah turned about and came back, and went to
Johanan the son of Kareah. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> But
Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men, and
went to the children of Ammon. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> Then
Johanan the son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces who were

Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, from Mizpah, after he had killed Gedaliah
the son of Ahikam—the men of war, with the women, the children, and the

<p><span class="bibleverse">27</span> “Set up a standard in the land!
Blow the trumpet amongst the nations! Prepare the nations against her!
Call together against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz!
Appoint a marshal against her! Cause the horses to come up as the
swarming locusts! <span class="bibleverse">28</span> Prepare against her
the nations, the kings of the Medes, its governors, and all its
deputies, and all the land of their dominion! <span
class="bibleverse">29</span> The land trembles and is in pain; for the
purposes of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> against Babylon
stand, to make the land of Babylon a desolation, without inhabitant.
<span class="bibleverse">30</span> The mighty men of Babylon have
stopped fighting, they remain in their strongholds. Their might has
failed. They have become as women. Her dwelling places are set on fire.
Her bars are broken. <span class="bibleverse">31</span> One runner will
run to meet another, and one messenger to meet another, to show the king
of Babylon that his city is taken on every quarter. <span
class="bibleverse">32</span> So the passages are seized. They have burnt
the reeds with fire. The men of war are frightened.” <span
class="bibleverse">33</span> For the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>
of Armies, the God of Israel says: “The daughter of Babylon is like a
threshing floor at the time when it is trodden. Yet a little while, and
the time of harvest comes for her.”</p>
<h2 id="babylons-debt-to-jerusalem-and-gods-revenge">Babylon's debt to
Jerusalem and God's revenge</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">34</span> “Nebuchadnezzar the king of
Babylon has devoured me. He has crushed me. He has made me an empty
vessel. He has, like a monster, swallowed me up. He has filled his mouth
with my delicacies. He has cast me out. <span
class="bibleverse">35</span> May the violence done to me and to my flesh
be on Babylon!” the inhabitant of Zion will say; and, “May my blood be
on the inhabitants of Chaldea!” will Jerusalem say. <span
class="bibleverse">36</span> Therefore the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> says: “Behold, I will plead your cause,
and take vengeance for you. I will dry up her sea, and make her fountain
dry. <span class="bibleverse">37</span> Babylon will become heaps, a
dwelling place for jackals, an astonishment, and a hissing, without
inhabitant. <span class="bibleverse">38</span> They will roar together
like young lions. They will growl as lions’ cubs. <span
class="bibleverse">39</span> When they are inflamed, I will make their
feast, and I will make them drunk, that they may rejoice, and sleep a
perpetual sleep, and not wake up,” says the <span

<p><span class="bibleverse">41</span> “How Sheshach is taken! How the
praise of the whole earth is seized! How Babylon has become a desolation
amongst the nations! <span class="bibleverse">42</span> The sea has come
up on Babylon. She is covered with the multitude of its waves. <span
class="bibleverse">43</span> Her cities have become a desolation, a dry
land, and a desert, a land in which no man dwells. No son of man passes
by it. <span class="bibleverse">44</span> I will execute judgement on
Bel in Babylon, and I will bring out of his mouth that which he has
swallowed up. The nations will not flow any more to him. Yes, the wall
of Babylon will fall. <span class="bibleverse">45</span> “My people, go
away from the middle of her, and each of you save yourselves from the
<span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s fierce anger. <span
class="bibleverse">46</span> Don’t let your heart faint. Don’t fear for
the news that will be heard in the land. For news will come one year,
and after that in another year news will come, and violence in the land,
ruler against ruler. <span class="bibleverse">47</span> Therefore
behold, the days come that I will execute judgement on the engraved
images of Babylon; and her whole land will be confounded. All her slain
will fall in the middle of her. <span class="bibleverse">48</span> Then
the heavens and the earth, and all that is therein, will sing for joy
over Babylon; for the destroyers will come to her from the north,” says
the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. <span
class="bibleverse">49</span> “As Babylon has caused the slain of Israel
to fall, so the slain of all the land will fall at Babylon. <span
class="bibleverse">50</span> You who have escaped the sword, go! Don’t
stand still! Remember the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> from afar,
and let Jerusalem come into your mind.” <span

reproach. Confusion has covered our faces, for strangers have come into

<span class="bibleverse">52</span> “Therefore behold, the days come,”
says the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, “that I will execute
judgement on her engraved images; and through all her land the wounded
will groan. <span class="bibleverse">53</span> Though Babylon should
mount up to the sky, and though she should fortify the height of her
strength, yet destroyers will come to her from me,” says the <span

<h2 id="conclusion-and-review">Conclusion and review</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">54</span> “The sound of a cry comes from
Babylon, and of great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans! <span
class="bibleverse">55</span> For the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>
lays Babylon waste, and destroys out of her the great voice! Their waves
roar like many waters. The noise of their voice is uttered. <span
class="bibleverse">56</span> For the destroyer has come on her, even on
Babylon. Her mighty men are taken. Their bows are broken in pieces, for
the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is a God of retribution. He will
surely repay. <span class="bibleverse">57</span> I will make her
princes, her wise men, her governors, her deputies, and her mighty men
drunk. They will sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake up,” says the
King, whose name is the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> of Armies.
<span class="bibleverse">58</span> The <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span> of Armies says: “The wide walls of Babylon
will be utterly overthrown. Her high gates will be burnt with fire. The
peoples will labour for vanity, and the nations for the fire; and they
will be weary.”</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">59</span> The word which Jeremiah the
prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, when
he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah to Babylon in the fourth year of
his reign. Now Seraiah was chief quartermaster. <span
class="bibleverse">60</span> Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that
should come on Babylon, even all these words that are written concerning
Babylon. <span class="bibleverse">61</span> Jeremiah said to Seraiah,
“When you come to Babylon, then see that you read all these words, <span
class="bibleverse">62</span> and say, ‘<span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, you have spoken concerning this place, to
cut it off, that no one will dwell in it, neither man nor animal, but
that it will be desolate forever.’ <span class="bibleverse">63</span> It
will be, when you have finished reading this book, that you shall bind a
stone to it, and cast it into the middle of the Euphrates. <span
class="bibleverse">64</span> Then you shall say, ‘Thus will Babylon
sink, and will not rise again because of the evil that I will bring on
her; and they will be weary.’” Thus far are the words of Jeremiah.</p>

desolation of Zedekiah; The Siege of Jerusalem; Escape and capture of

<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Zedekiah was twenty-one years old
when he began to reign. He reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. His
mother’s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> He did that which was evil in the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s sight, according to all that Jehoiakim
had done. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> For through the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s anger this happened in Jerusalem and
Judah, until he had cast them out from his presence. Zedekiah rebelled
against the king of Babylon. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> In the
ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the
month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against
Jerusalem, and encamped against it; and they built forts against it
round about. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> So the city was besieged
to the eleventh year of king Zedekiah. <span class="bibleverse">6</span>
In the fourth month, in the ninth day of the month, the famine was
severe in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the
land. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> Then a breach was made in the
city, and all the men of war fled, and went out of the city by night by
the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king’s
garden. Now the Chaldeans were against the city all around. The men of
war went towards the Arabah, <span class="bibleverse">8</span> but the
army of the Chaldeans pursued the king, and overtook Zedekiah in the
plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> Then they took the king, and carried him up
to the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; and he
pronounced judgement on him. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> The king
of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes. He also killed
all the princes of Judah in Riblah. <span class="bibleverse">11</span>
He put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him in
fetters, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison until the day
of his death.</p>

of inhabitants to Babylon; Executions in Ribla</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">12</span> Now in the fifth month, in the
tenth day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of king
Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard,
who stood before the king of Babylon, came into Jerusalem. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> He burnt the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s house, and the king’s house; and all the
houses of Jerusalem, even every great house, he burnt with fire. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> All the army of the Chaldeans, who were
with the captain of the guard, broke down all the walls of Jerusalem all
around. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> Then Nebuzaradan the captain
of the guard carried away captive of the poorest of the people, and the
rest of the people who were left in the city, and those who fell away,
who defected to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the multitude.
<span class="bibleverse">16</span> But Nebuzaradan the captain of the
guard left of the poorest of the land to be vineyard keepers and
farmers. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> The Chaldeans broke the
pillars of bronze that were in the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s
house and the bases and the bronze sea that were in the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s house in pieces, and carried all of
their bronze to Babylon. <span class="bibleverse">18</span> They also
took away the pots, the shovels, the snuffers, the basins, the spoons,
and all the vessels of bronze with which they ministered. <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> The captain of the guard took away the
cups, the fire pans, the basins, the pots, the lamp stands, the spoons,
and the bowls; that which was of gold, as gold, and that which was of
silver, as silver. <span class="bibleverse">20</span> They took the two
pillars, the one sea, and the twelve bronze bulls that were under the
bases, which king Solomon had made for the <span
class="smallcaps">Lord</span>’s house. The bronze of all these vessels
was without weight. <span class="bibleverse">21</span> As for the
pillars, the height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits;<a
href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> and a line of twelve cubits
encircled it; and its thickness was four fingers. It was hollow. <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> A capital of bronze was on it; and the
height of the one capital was five cubits,<a href="#fn11"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>
with network and pomegranates on the capital all around, all of bronze.
The second pillar also had the same, with pomegranates. <span
class="bibleverse">23</span> There were ninety-six pomegranates on the
sides; all the pomegranates were one hundred on the network all around.
<span class="bibleverse">24</span> The captain of the guard took Seraiah
the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers
of the threshold, <span class="bibleverse">25</span> and out of the city
he took an officer who was set over the men of war; and seven men of
those who saw the king’s face, who were found in the city; and the
scribe of the captain of the army, who mustered the people of the land;
and sixty men of the people of the land, who were found in the middle of
the city. <span class="bibleverse">26</span> Nebuzaradan the captain of
the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah.
<span class="bibleverse">27</span> The king of Babylon struck them, and
put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried
away captive out of his land.</p>
<h2 id="the-numbers-that-were-taken">The numbers that were taken</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">28</span> This is the number of the people
whom Nebuchadnezzar carried away captive: in the seventh year, three
thousand and twenty-three Jews; <span class="bibleverse">29</span> in
the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar, he carried away captive from
Jerusalem eight hundred and thirty-two persons; <span
class="bibleverse">30</span> in the twenty-third year of Nebuchadnezzar,
Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews
seven hundred and forty-five people. All the people numbered four
thousand and six hundred.</p>
<h2 id="johachín-pardoned-after-thirty-seven-years-in-prison">Johachín
pardoned after thirty-seven years in prison</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">31</span> In the thirty-seventh year of the
captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the
twenty-fifth day of the month, Evilmerodach king of Babylon, in the
first year of his reign, lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah,
and released him from prison. <span class="bibleverse">32</span> He
spoke kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings
who were with him in Babylon, <span class="bibleverse">33</span> and
changed his prison garments. Jehoiachin ate bread before him continually
all the days of his life. <span class="bibleverse">34</span> For his
allowance, there was a continual allowance given him by the king of
Babylon, every day a portion until the day of his death, all the days of
his life.</p>
