<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, to the
assembly of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus
Christ:<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Grace to you and peace from God our
Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">2</span> We always give thanks to God for
all of you, mentioning you in our prayers, <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> remembering without ceasing your work of
faith and labour of love and perseverance of hope in our Lord Jesus
Christ, before our God and Father. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> We
know, brothers<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> loved by God, that you are chosen,
<span class="bibleverse">5</span> and that our Good News came to you not
in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit and with much
assurance. You know what kind of men we showed ourselves to be amongst
you for your sake. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> You became
imitators of us and of the Lord, having received the word in much
affliction, with joy of the Holy Spirit, <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> so that you became an example to all who
believe in Macedonia and in Achaia. <span class="bibleverse">8</span>
For from you the word of the Lord has been declared, not only in
Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith towards God has
gone out, so that we need not to say anything. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> For they themselves report concerning us
what kind of a reception we had from you, and how you turned to God from
idols to serve a living and true God, <span class="bibleverse">10</span>
and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead:
Jesus, who delivers us from the wrath to come.</p>
<h1 id="section-1">2</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> For you yourselves know, brothers,
our visit to you wasn’t in vain, <span class="bibleverse">2</span> but
having suffered before and been shamefully treated, as you know, at
Philippi, we grew bold in our God to tell you the Good News of God in
much conflict. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> For our exhortation is
not of error, nor of uncleanness, nor in deception. <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> But even as we have been approved by God to
be entrusted with the Good News, so we speak—not as pleasing men, but
God, who tests our hearts. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> For neither
were we at any time found using words of flattery, as you know, nor a
cloak of covetousness (God is witness), <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> nor seeking glory from men (neither from you
nor from others), when we might have claimed authority as apostles of
Christ. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> But we were gentle amongst
you, like a nursing mother cherishes her own children.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">8</span> Even so, affectionately longing for
you, we were well pleased to impart to you not the Good News of God
only, but also our own souls, because you had become very dear to us.
<span class="bibleverse">9</span> For you remember, brothers, our labour
and travail; for working night and day, that we might not burden any of
you, we preached to you the Good News of God. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> You are witnesses with God how holy,
righteously, and blamelessly we behaved ourselves towards you who
believe. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> As you know, we exhorted,
comforted, and implored every one of you, as a father does his own
children, <span class="bibleverse">12</span> to the end that you should
walk worthily of God, who calls you into his own Kingdom and glory.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">13</span> For this cause we also thank God
without ceasing that when you received from us the word of the message
of God, you accepted it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth,
God’s word, which also works in you who believe. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> For you, brothers, became imitators of the
assemblies of God which are in Judea in Christ Jesus; for you also
suffered the same things from your own countrymen, even as they did from
the Jews <span class="bibleverse">15</span> who killed both the Lord
Jesus and their own prophets, and drove us out, and don’t please God,
and are contrary to all men, <span class="bibleverse">16</span>
forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they may be saved, to fill
up their sins always. But wrath has come on them to the uttermost.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">17</span> But we, brothers, being bereaved
of you for a short season in presence, not in heart, tried even harder
to see your face with great desire, <span class="bibleverse">18</span>
because we wanted to come to you—indeed, I, Paul, once and again—but
Satan hindered us. <span class="bibleverse">19</span> For what is our
hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Isn’t it even you, before our Lord
Jesus<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> at his coming? <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> For you are our glory and our joy.</p>
<h1 id="section-2">3</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Therefore when we couldn’t stand it
any longer, we thought it good to be left behind at Athens alone, <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> and sent Timothy, our brother and God’s
servant in the Good News of Christ, to establish you and to comfort you
concerning your faith, <span class="bibleverse">3</span> that no one
would be moved by these afflictions. For you know that we are appointed
to this task. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> For most certainly, when
we were with you, we told you beforehand that we are to suffer
affliction, even as it happened, and you know. <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> For this cause I also, when I couldn’t stand
it any longer, sent that I might know your faith, for fear that by any
means the tempter had tempted you, and our labour would have been in
vain.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">6</span> But Timothy just now come to us
from you, and brought us glad news of your faith and love, and that you
have good memories of us always, longing to see us, even as we also long
to see you. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> For this cause, brothers,
we were comforted over you in all our distress and affliction through
your faith. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> For now we live, if you
stand fast in the Lord. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> For what
thanksgiving can we render again to God for you, for all the joy with
which we rejoice for your sakes before our God, <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> night and day praying exceedingly that we
may see your face and may perfect that which is lacking in your
faith?</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">11</span> Now may our God and Father
himself, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way to you. <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> May the Lord make you to increase and
abound in love towards one another and towards all men, even as we also
do towards you, <span class="bibleverse">13</span> to the end he may
establish your hearts blameless in holiness before our God and Father at
the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints.</p>
<h1 id="section-3">4</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Finally then, brothers, we beg and
exhort you in the Lord Jesus, that as you received from us how you ought
to walk and to please God, that you abound more and more. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> For you know what instructions we gave you
through the Lord Jesus. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> For this is
the will of God: your sanctification, that you abstain from sexual
immorality, <span class="bibleverse">4</span> that each one of you know
how to control his own body<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> in sanctification and
honour, <span class="bibleverse">5</span> not in the passion of lust,
even as the Gentiles who don’t know God, <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> that no one should take advantage of and
wrong a brother or sister in this matter; because the Lord is an avenger
in all these things, as also we forewarned you and testified. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> For God called us not for uncleanness, but
in sanctification. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> Therefore he who
rejects this doesn’t reject man, but God, who has also given his Holy
Spirit to you.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">9</span> But concerning brotherly love, you
have no need that one write to you. For you yourselves are taught by God
to love one another, <span class="bibleverse">10</span> for indeed you
do it towards all the brothers who are in all Macedonia. But we exhort
you, brothers, that you abound more and more; <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> and that you make it your ambition to lead
a quiet life, and to do your own business, and to work with your own
hands, even as we instructed you, <span class="bibleverse">12</span>
that you may walk properly towards those who are outside, and may have
need of nothing.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">13</span> But we don’t want you to be
ignorant, brothers, concerning those who have fallen asleep, so that you
don’t grieve like the rest, who have no hope. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> For if we believe that Jesus died and rose
again, even so God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep in
Jesus. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> For this we tell you by the
word of the Lord, that we who are alive, who are left until the coming
of the Lord, will in no way precede those who have fallen asleep. <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> For the Lord himself will descend from
heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel and with God’s
trumpet. The dead in Christ will rise first, <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> then we who are alive, who are left, will
be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the
air. So we will be with the Lord forever. <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> Therefore comfort one another with these
words.</p>
<h1 id="section-4">5</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> But concerning the times and the
seasons, brothers, you have no need that anything be written to you.
<span class="bibleverse">2</span> For you yourselves know well that the
day of the Lord comes like a thief in the night. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> For when they are saying, “Peace and
safety,” then sudden destruction will come on them, like birth pains on
a pregnant woman. Then they will in no way escape. <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> But you, brothers, aren’t in darkness, that
the day should overtake you like a thief. <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> You are all children of light and children
of the day. We don’t belong to the night, nor to darkness, <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> so then let’s not sleep, as the rest do, but
let’s watch and be sober. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> For those
who sleep, sleep in the night; and those who are drunk are drunk in the
night. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> But since we belong to the day,
let’s be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and for a
helmet, the hope of salvation. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> For God
didn’t appoint us to wrath, but to the obtaining of salvation through
our Lord Jesus Christ, <span class="bibleverse">10</span> who died for
us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.
<span class="bibleverse">11</span> Therefore exhort one another, and
build each other up, even as you also do.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">12</span> But we beg you, brothers, to know
those who labour amongst you, and are over you in the Lord and admonish
you, <span class="bibleverse">13</span> and to respect and honour them
in love for their work’s sake.</p>
<p>Be at peace amongst yourselves. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> We
exhort you, brothers: Admonish the disorderly; encourage the
faint-hearted; support the weak; be patient towards all. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> See that no one returns evil for evil to
anyone, but always follow after that which is good for one another and
for all.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">16</span> Always rejoice. <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> Pray without ceasing. <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> In everything give thanks, for this is the
will of God in Christ Jesus towards you. <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> Don’t quench the Spirit. <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> Don’t despise prophecies. <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> Test all things, and hold firmly that which
is good. <span class="bibleverse">22</span> Abstain from every form of
evil.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">23</span> May the God of peace himself
sanctify you completely. May your whole spirit, soul, and body be
preserved blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">24</span> He who calls you is faithful, who
will also do it.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">25</span> Brothers, pray for us.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">26</span> Greet all the brothers with a holy
kiss. <span class="bibleverse">27</span> I solemnly command you by the
Lord that this letter be read to all the holy brothers.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">28</span> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ
be with you. Amen.</p>
