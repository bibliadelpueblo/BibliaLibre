^-1^
### Name of the sender and recipient of the letter and apostolic blessing to the congregation
^7^
### Thanksgiving of the Apostle to God for the state of faith of the community and expression of the desire to be able to preach the message of salvation also in Rome
^15^
### Indication of the topic: The justification
^17^
### The sin guilt of all paganism
^23^
### Divine judgment on the pagan world due to its ruin
       
## 2
^-1^
### The judgment of wrath is also before the Jews; judging others does not free them from God's judgment
^11^
### God's judgment is the same for Jews and Gentiles, determined solely by compliance with the law
^16^
### Better moral knowledge and the ability to teach do not make Jews righteous before God; his fame for the law is null because he transgresses it
^24^
### Circumcision has no value for the Jew if it breaks the law; Circumcision of the “heart” is necessary
         
## 3
^-1^
### However, the privileged position of the Jews remains; their unfaithfulness puts God's faithfulness in a brighter light
^8^
### Result: The corruption of sin extends to Gentiles and Jews and is confirmed by numerous scriptures
^20^
### The justice of God is granted to those who believe in Jesus
^26^
### God's righteousness by faith excludes all self fame and applies to Gentiles as well as Jews
        
## 4
^-1^
### Evidence of the righteousness of faith in Abraham and through a testimony of David
^8^
### Abraham as the father of all believers, including Gentiles
^12^
### The promise of salvation did not come to Abraham by law, but by faith
^17^
### The exemplary faith of Abraham
^22^
### Such faith also brings us justice and happiness
   
## 5
^-1^
### Future salvation is guaranteed to the justified despite all tribulations because of God's love demonstrated by Christ's sacrificial death
^11^
### Christ as the opposite of Adam; the grace that brings immortal life is more powerful than mortal sin
             
## 6
^-1^
### We were crucified with them, died with them, buried with them and rose with Christ Jesus
^7^
### Living with the Risen Christ
^11^
### The apostle's admonition to the faithful to abide in this knowledge of salvation and no longer serve sin
^14^
### The service of sin has given way to justice
        
## 7
^-1^
### When we have died and risen with Christ, we are legitimately free from the law and we are obligated to serve the risen Christ believing ourselves dead to sin
^6^
### The calamitous effect of the law, which familiarizes man with sin and gives life to sin in the flesh
^13^
### The impotence of the law and of good will in the face of sin as power in the flesh
         
## 8
^-1^
### The Christian is under the law of the Spirit
^4^
### The contrast between those who serve God in the Spirit and those who live by the instincts of the flesh
^8^
### The Christian as the abode of the Spirit
^11^
### The possession of the spirit guarantees the physical redemption of the children of God if they endure the sufferings of this time
^27^
### The beginning of our communion with God, God's work, guarantees its final completion
^30^
### Therefore our state of salvation is divinely assured against all powers and our certainty of faith and assurance of salvation is justified
            
## 9
^-1^
### Introduction: The deep sorrow of the apostle for the temporary exclusion of his people from salvation
^5^
### God's promises to Israel are unbreakable, but they do not apply to the whole body, but only to the spiritual descendants of Abraham
^13^
### Election to salvation is a free work of God's grace; the denial of salvation and grace does not allow man to fight with God
^29^
### The guilt of the Jews consisted in the rejection of the righteousness of faith and excessive persecution of the righteousness of works
     
## 10
^3^
### Israel's fault is even more serious since God has neglected nothing to bring Israel to the righteousness of faith since the time of Moses
^15^
### The inexcusability of the unbelieving part of Israel, which has rejected the salvation that was also offered
   
## 11
^-1^
### Most of the Jews are stubborn and rejected by God, but even now a small part is destined for salvation through God's grace
^10^
### The divine purpose of salvation in the calling of the Gentiles was to overcome the unbelief of the Jews by encouraging them to emulate them; your rejection is not final
^24^
### All the rest of the people of Israel will eventually come to faith after the Gentile choices are converted, and all will be used for the justification and glorification of God
