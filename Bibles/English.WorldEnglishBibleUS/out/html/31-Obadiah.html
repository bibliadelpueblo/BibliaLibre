<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> The vision of Obadiah. This is what
the Lord<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Yahweh<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>
says about Edom. We have heard news from Yahweh, and an ambassador is
sent among the nations, saying, “Arise, and let’s rise up against her in
battle. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> Behold,<a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> I
have made you small among the nations. You are greatly despised. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> The pride of your heart has deceived you,
you who dwell in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation is high, who
says in his heart, ‘Who will bring me down to the ground?’ <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> Though you mount on high as the eagle, and
though your nest is set among the stars, I will bring you down from
there,” says Yahweh. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> “If thieves came
to you, if robbers by night—oh, what disaster awaits you—wouldn’t they
only steal until they had enough? If grape pickers came to you, wouldn’t
they leave some gleaning grapes? <span class="bibleverse">6</span> How
Esau will be ransacked! How his hidden treasures are sought out! <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> All the men of your alliance have brought
you on your way, even to the border. The men who were at peace with you
have deceived you, and prevailed against you. Friends who eat your bread
lay a snare under you. There is no understanding in him.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">8</span> “Won’t I in that day”, says Yahweh,
“destroy the wise men out of Edom, and understanding out of the mountain
of Esau? <span class="bibleverse">9</span> Your mighty men, Teman, will
be dismayed, to the end that everyone may be cut off from the mountain
of Esau by slaughter. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> For the
violence done to your brother Jacob, shame will cover you, and you will
be cut off forever. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> In the day that
you stood on the other side, in the day that strangers carried away his
substance and foreigners entered into his gates and cast lots for
Jerusalem, even you were like one of them. <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> But don’t look down on your brother in the
day of his disaster, and don’t rejoice over the children of Judah in the
day of their destruction. Don’t speak proudly in the day of distress.
<span class="bibleverse">13</span> Don’t enter into the gate of my
people in the day of their calamity. Don’t look down on their affliction
in the day of their calamity, neither seize their wealth on the day of
their calamity. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> Don’t stand in the
crossroads to cut off those of his who escape. Don’t deliver up those of
his who remain in the day of distress. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> For the day of Yahweh is near all the
nations! As you have done, it will be done to you. Your deeds will
return upon your own head. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> For as you
have drunk on my holy mountain, so all the nations will drink
continually. Yes, they will drink, swallow down, and will be as though
they had not been. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> But in Mount Zion,
there will be those who escape, and it will be holy. The house of Jacob
will possess their possessions. <span class="bibleverse">18</span> The
house of Jacob will be a fire, the house of Joseph a flame, and the
house of Esau for stubble. They will burn among them and devour them.
There will not be any remaining to the house of Esau.” Indeed, Yahweh
has spoken.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">19</span> Those of the South will possess
the mountain of Esau, and those of the lowland, the Philistines. They
will possess the field of Ephraim, and the field of Samaria. Benjamin
will possess Gilead. <span class="bibleverse">20</span> The captives of
this army of the children of Israel, who are among the Canaanites, will
possess even to Zarephath; and the captives of Jerusalem, who are in
Sepharad, will possess the cities of the Negev. <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> Saviors will go up on Mount Zion to judge
the mountains of Esau, and the kingdom will be Yahweh’s.</p>
