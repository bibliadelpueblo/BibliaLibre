<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ<a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> through the will of God, according
to the promise of the life which is in Christ Jesus, <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> to Timothy, my beloved child: Grace, mercy,
and peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">3</span> I thank God, whom I serve as my
forefathers did, with a pure conscience. How unceasing is my memory of
you in my petitions, night and day <span class="bibleverse">4</span>
longing to see you, remembering your tears, that I may be filled with
joy; <span class="bibleverse">5</span> having been reminded of the
sincere faith that is in you, which lived first in your grandmother Lois
and your mother Eunice and, I am persuaded, in you also.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">6</span> For this cause, I remind you that
you should stir up the gift of God which is in you through the laying on
of my hands. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> For God didn’t give us a
spirit of fear, but of power, love, and self-control. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> Therefore don’t be ashamed of the testimony
of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner; but endure hardship for the Good
News according to the power of God, <span class="bibleverse">9</span>
who saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our
works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given to us
in Christ Jesus before times eternal, <span class="bibleverse">10</span>
but has now been revealed by the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus,
who abolished death, and brought life and immortality to light through
the Good News. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> For this I was
appointed as a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.
<span class="bibleverse">12</span> For this cause I also suffer these
things.</p>
<p>Yet I am not ashamed, for I know him whom I have believed, and I am
persuaded that he is able to guard that which I have committed to him
against that day.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">13</span> Hold the pattern of sound words
which you have heard from me, in faith and love which is in Christ
Jesus. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> That good thing which was
committed to you, guard through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">15</span> This you know, that all who are in
Asia turned away from me, of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes. <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> May the Lord grant mercy to the house of
Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain,
<span class="bibleverse">17</span> but when he was in Rome, he sought me
diligently and found me <span class="bibleverse">18</span> (the Lord
grant to him to find the Lord’s mercy in that day); and in how many
things he served at Ephesus, you know very well.</p>
<h1 id="section-1">2</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> You therefore, my child, be
strengthened in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> The things which you have heard from me
among many witnesses, commit the same things to faithful men who will be
able to teach others also. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> You
therefore must endure hardship as a good soldier of Christ Jesus. <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> No soldier on duty entangles himself in the
affairs of life, that he may please him who enrolled him as a soldier.
<span class="bibleverse">5</span> Also, if anyone competes in athletics,
he isn’t crowned unless he has competed by the rules. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> The farmer who labors must be the first to
get a share of the crops. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> Consider
what I say, and may the Lord give you understanding in all things.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">8</span> Remember Jesus Christ, risen from
the dead, of the offspring<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> of David, according to
my Good News, <span class="bibleverse">9</span> in which I suffer
hardship to the point of chains as a criminal. But God’s word isn’t
chained. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> Therefore I endure all
things for the chosen ones’ sake, that they also may obtain the
salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> This saying is trustworthy: “For if we died
with him, we will also live with him. <span class="bibleverse">12</span>
If we endure, we will also reign with him. If we deny him, he also will
deny us. <span class="bibleverse">13</span> If we are faithless, he
remains faithful; for he can’t deny himself.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">14</span> Remind them of these things,
charging them in the sight of the Lord that they don’t argue about words
to no profit, to the subverting of those who hear.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">15</span> Give diligence to present yourself
approved by God, a workman who doesn’t need to be ashamed, properly
handling the Word of Truth. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> But shun
empty chatter, for it will go further in ungodliness, <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> and those words will consume like gangrene,
of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus: <span class="bibleverse">18</span>
men who have erred concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection is
already past, and overthrowing the faith of some. <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> However, God’s firm foundation stands,
having this seal: “The Lord knows those who are his,”<a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>
and, “Let every one who names the name of the Lord<a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>
depart from unrighteousness.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">20</span> Now in a large house there are not
only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of clay. Some
are for honor and some for dishonor. <span class="bibleverse">21</span>
If anyone therefore purges himself from these, he will be a vessel for
honor, sanctified, and suitable for the master’s use, prepared for every
good work.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">22</span> Flee from youthful lusts; but
pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace with those who call on the
Lord out of a pure heart. <span class="bibleverse">23</span> But refuse
foolish and ignorant questionings, knowing that they generate strife.
<span class="bibleverse">24</span> The Lord’s servant must not quarrel,
but be gentle toward all, able to teach, patient, <span
class="bibleverse">25</span> in gentleness correcting those who oppose
him. Perhaps God may give them repentance leading to a full knowledge of
the truth, <span class="bibleverse">26</span> and they may recover
themselves out of the devil’s snare, having been taken captive by him to
do his will.</p>
<h1 id="section-2">3</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> But know this: that in the last
days, grievous times will come. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> For
men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant,
blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> without natural affection, unforgiving,
slanderers, without self-control, fierce, not lovers of good, <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> traitors, headstrong, conceited, lovers of
pleasure rather than lovers of God, <span class="bibleverse">5</span>
holding a form of godliness but having denied its power. Turn away from
these, also. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> For some of these are
people who creep into houses and take captive gullible women loaded down
with sins, led away by various lusts, <span class="bibleverse">7</span>
always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.
<span class="bibleverse">8</span> Even as Jannes and Jambres opposed
Moses, so these also oppose the truth, men corrupted in mind, who
concerning the faith are rejected. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> But
they will proceed no further. For their folly will be evident to all
men, as theirs also came to be.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">10</span> But you followed my teaching,
conduct, purpose, faith, patience, love, steadfastness, <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> persecutions, and sufferings—those things
that happened to me at Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. I endured those
persecutions. The Lord delivered me out of them all. <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> Yes, and all who desire to live godly in
Christ Jesus will suffer persecution. <span class="bibleverse">13</span>
But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving and
being deceived. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> But you remain in the
things which you have learned and have been assured of, knowing from
whom you have learned them. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> From
infancy, you have known the holy Scriptures which are able to make you
wise for salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> Every Scripture is God-breathed and<a
href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> profitable for teaching, for
reproof, for correction, and for instruction in righteousness, <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> that each person who belongs to God may be
complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work.</p>
<h1 id="section-3">4</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> I command you therefore before God
and the Lord Jesus Christ, who will judge the living and the dead at his
appearing and his Kingdom: <span class="bibleverse">2</span> preach the
word; be urgent in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and exhort
with all patience and teaching. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> For
the time will come when they will not listen to the sound doctrine, but
having itching ears, will heap up for themselves teachers after their
own lusts, <span class="bibleverse">4</span> and will turn away their
ears from the truth, and turn away to fables. <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> But you be sober in all things, suffer
hardship, do the work of an evangelist, and fulfill your ministry.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">6</span> For I am already being offered, and
the time of my departure has come. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> I
have fought the good fight. I have finished the course. I have kept the
faith. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> From now on, the crown of
righteousness is stored up for me, which the Lord, the righteous judge,
will give to me on that day; and not to me only, but also to all those
who have loved his appearing.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">9</span> Be diligent to come to me soon,
<span class="bibleverse">10</span> for Demas left me, having loved this
present world, and went to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia; and Titus
to Dalmatia. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> Only Luke is with me.
Take Mark and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for service.
<span class="bibleverse">12</span> But I sent Tychicus to Ephesus. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> Bring the cloak that I left at Troas with
Carpus when you come—and the books, especially the parchments. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> Alexander the coppersmith did much evil to
me. The Lord will repay him according to his deeds. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> Beware of him, for he greatly opposed our
words.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">16</span> At my first defense, no one came
to help me, but all left me. May it not be held against them. <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> But the Lord stood by me and strengthened
me, that through me the message might be fully proclaimed, and that all
the Gentiles might hear. So I was delivered out of the mouth of the
lion. <span class="bibleverse">18</span> And the Lord will deliver me
from every evil work and will preserve me for his heavenly Kingdom. To
him be the glory forever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">19</span> Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the
house of Onesiphorus. <span class="bibleverse">20</span> Erastus
remained at Corinth, but I left Trophimus at Miletus sick. <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> Be diligent to come before winter. Eubulus
salutes you, as do Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">22</span> The Lord Jesus Christ be with your
spirit. Grace be with you. Amen.</p>
