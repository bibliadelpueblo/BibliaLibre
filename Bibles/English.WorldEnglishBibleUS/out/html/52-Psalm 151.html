<p>151This Psalm is a genuine one of David, though extra,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> composed when he fought in single combat with Goliath. <sup>1</sup> I was small among my brothers, and youngest in my father’s house. I tended my father’s sheep. <sup>2</sup> My hands formed a musical instrument, and my fingers tuned a lyre. <sup>3</sup> Who shall tell my Lord? The Lord himself, he himself hears. <sup>4</sup> He sent forth his angel and took me from my father’s sheep, and he anointed me with his anointing oil. <sup>5</sup> My brothers were handsome and tall; but the Lord didn’t take pleasure in them. <sup>6</sup> I went out to meet the Philistine, and he cursed me by his idols. <sup>7</sup> But I drew his own sword and beheaded him, and removed reproach from the children of Israel.</p>
