<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Now in the days of Ahasuerus (this
is Ahasuerus who reigned from India even to Ethiopia, over one hundred
twenty-seven provinces), <span class="bibleverse">2</span> in those
days, when the King Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which
was in Susa the palace, <span class="bibleverse">3</span> in the third
year of his reign, he made a feast for all his princes and his servants;
the army of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes of the provinces
being before him. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> He displayed the

many days, even one hundred eighty days.</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">6</span> There were hangings of white and
blue material, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver
rings and marble pillars. The couches were of gold and silver, on a
pavement of red, white, yellow, and black marble. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> They gave them drinks in golden vessels of
various kinds, including royal wine in abundance, according to the
bounty of the king. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> In accordance with
the law, the drinking was not compulsory; for so the king had instructed
all the officials of his house, that they should do according to every
man’s pleasure. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> Also Vashti the queen
made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to King
Ahasuerus.</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">10</span> On the seventh day, when the heart
of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona,
Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcass, the seven eunuchs who served
in the presence of Ahasuerus the king, <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> to bring Vashti the queen before the king
wearing the royal crown, to show the people and the princes her beauty;
for she was beautiful. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> But the queen
Vashti refused to come at the king’s commandment by the eunuchs.
Therefore the king was very angry, and his anger burned in him.</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">13</span> Then the king said to the wise
men, who knew the times (for it was the king’s custom to consult those
who knew law and judgment; <span class="bibleverse">14</span> and next
to him were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and
Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, who saw the king’s face,
and sat first in the kingdom), <span class="bibleverse">15</span> “What
shall we do to Queen Vashti according to law, because she has not done
the bidding of the King Ahasuerus by the eunuchs?” <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> Memucan answered before the king and the
princes, “Vashti the queen has not done wrong to just the king, but also
to all the princes, and to all the people who are in all the provinces
of the King Ahasuerus. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> For this deed
of the queen will become known to all women, causing them to show
contempt for their husbands when it is reported, ‘King Ahasuerus
commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she didn’t
come.’ <span class="bibleverse">18</span> Today, the princesses of
Persia and Media who have heard of the queen’s deed will tell all the
king’s princes. This will cause much contempt and wrath. <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> “If it pleases the king, let a royal
commandment go from him, and let it be written among the laws of the
Persians and the Medes, so that it cannot be altered, that Vashti may
never again come before King Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal
estate to another who is better than she. <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> When the king’s decree which he shall make
is published throughout all his kingdom (for it is great), all the wives
will give their husbands honor, both great and small.” <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> This advice pleased the king and the
princes, and the king did according to the word of Memucan: <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> for he sent letters into all the king’s
provinces, into every province according to its writing, and to every
people in their language, that every man should rule his own house,
speaking in the language of his own people.</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> After these things, when the wrath
of King Ahasuerus was pacified, he remembered Vashti, and what she had
done, and what was decreed against her. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> Then the king’s servants who served him
said, “Let beautiful young virgins be sought for the king. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> Let the king appoint officers in all the
provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather together all the
beautiful young virgins to the citadel of Susa, to the women’s house, to
the custody of Hegai the king’s eunuch, keeper of the women. Let
cosmetics be given them; <span class="bibleverse">4</span> and let the
maiden who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti.” The thing
pleased the king, and he did so.</p>
<h2 id="information-on-the-prehistory-of-esther">Information on the
prehistory of Esther</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">5</span> There was a certain Jew in the
citadel of Susa whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of
Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite, <span class="bibleverse">6</span>
who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captives who had been
carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king
of Babylon had carried away.</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">7</span> He brought up Hadassah, that is,
Esther, his uncle’s daughter; for she had neither father nor mother. The
maiden was fair and beautiful; and when her father and mother were dead,
Mordecai took her for his own daughter.</p>
<h2
id="esthers-year-of-preparation-in-the-royal-palace-and-her-elevation-to-queen">Esther's

<p><span class="bibleverse">8</span> So, when the king’s commandment and
his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together to
the citadel of Susa, to the custody of Hegai, Esther was taken into the
king’s house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> The maiden pleased him, and she obtained
kindness from him. He quickly gave her cosmetics and her portions of
food, and the seven choice maidens who were to be given her out of the
king’s house. He moved her and her maidens to the best place in the
women’s house. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> Esther had not made
known her people nor her relatives, because Mordecai had instructed her
that she should not make it known.</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">11</span> Mordecai walked every day in front
of the court of the women’s house, to find out how Esther was doing, and
what would become of her. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> Each young
woman’s turn came to go in to King Ahasuerus after her purification for
twelve months (for so were the days of their purification accomplished,
six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet fragrances and
with preparations for beautifying women). <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> The young woman then came to the king like
this: whatever she desired was given her to go with her out of the
women’s house to the king’s house. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> In
the evening she went, and on the next day she returned into the second
women’s house, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king’s eunuch, who kept
the concubines. She came in to the king no more, unless the king
delighted in her, and she was called by name. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter
of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter,
came to go in to the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the
king’s eunuch, the keeper of the women, advised. Esther obtained favor
in the sight of all those who looked at her. <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> So Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus into
his royal house in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the
seventh year of his reign. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> The king
loved Esther more than all the women, and she obtained favor and
kindness in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the
royal crown on her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti. <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> Then the king made a great feast for all
his princes and his servants, even Esther’s feast; and he proclaimed a
holiday in the provinces, and gave gifts according to the king’s
bounty.</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">19</span> When the virgins were gathered
together the second time, Mordecai was sitting in the king’s gate. <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> Esther had not yet made known her relatives
nor her people, as Mordecai had commanded her; for Esther obeyed
Mordecai, like she did when she was brought up by him. <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> In those days, while Mordecai was sitting
in the king’s gate, two of the king’s eunuchs, Bigthan and Teresh, who
were doorkeepers, were angry, and sought to lay hands on the King
Ahasuerus. <span class="bibleverse">22</span> This thing became known to
Mordecai, who informed Esther the queen; and Esther informed the king in
Mordecai’s name. <span class="bibleverse">23</span> When this matter was
investigated, and it was found to be so, they were both hanged on a
gallows; and it was written in the book of the chronicles in the king’s
presence.</p>

<h2 id="jobs-desperate-lament">Job's desperate lament</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> After these things King Ahasuerus
promoted Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and
set his seat above all the princes who were with him. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> All the king’s servants who were in the
king’s gate bowed down and paid homage to Haman, for the king had so
commanded concerning him. But Mordecai didn’t bow down or pay him
homage. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> Then the king’s servants who
were in the king’s gate said to Mordecai, “Why do you disobey the king’s
commandment?” <span class="bibleverse">4</span> Now it came to pass,
when they spoke daily to him, and he didn’t listen to them, that they
told Haman, to see whether Mordecai’s reason would stand; for he had
told them that he was a Jew. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> When
Haman saw that Mordecai didn’t bow down nor pay him homage, Haman was
full of wrath. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> But he scorned the
thought of laying hands on Mordecai alone, for they had made known to
him Mordecai’s people. Therefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews
who were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even Mordecai’s
people.</p>
<h2 id="haman-enforces-his-resolution-with-the-king">Haman enforces his
resolution with the king</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">7</span> In the first month, which is the
month Nisan, in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that
is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, and
chose the twelfth month, which is the month Adar. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> Haman said to King Ahasuerus, “There is a
certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples in all
the provinces of your kingdom, and their laws are different from other
people’s. They don’t keep the king’s laws. Therefore it is not for the
king’s profit to allow them to remain. <span class="bibleverse">9</span>
If it pleases the king, let it be written that they be destroyed; and I
will pay ten thousand talents<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> of silver into the hands
of those who are in charge of the king’s business, to bring it into the
king’s treasuries.” <span class="bibleverse">10</span> The king took his
ring from his hand, and gave it to Haman the son of Hammedatha the
Agagite, the Jews’ enemy. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> The king
said to Haman, “The silver is given to you, the people also, to do with
them as it seems good to you.”</p>
<h2
id="the-extermination-of-the-jews-throughout-the-empire-ordered-by-the-king">The

<p><span class="bibleverse">12</span> Then the king’s scribes were
called in on the first month, on the thirteenth day of the month; and
all that Haman commanded was written to the king’s local governors, and
to the governors who were over every province, and to the princes of
every people, to every province according to its writing, and to every
people in their language. It was written in the name of King Ahasuerus,
and it was sealed with the king’s ring. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> Letters were sent by couriers into all the
king’s provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews,
both young and old, little children and women, in one day, even on the
thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to
plunder their possessions. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> A copy of
the letter, that the decree should be given out in every province, was
published to all the peoples, that they should be ready against that
day. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> The couriers went out in haste
by the king’s commandment, and the decree was given out in the citadel
of Susa. The king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city of Susa was
perplexed.</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Now when Mordecai found out all
that was done, Mordecai tore his clothes and put on sackcloth with
ashes, and went out into the middle of the city, and wailed loudly and
bitterly. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> He came even before the
king’s gate, for no one is allowed inside the king’s gate clothed with
sackcloth. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> In every province, wherever
the king’s commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning
among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in
sackcloth and ashes.</p>
<h2

<p><span class="bibleverse">4</span> Esther’s maidens and her eunuchs
came and told her this, and the queen was exceedingly grieved. She sent
clothing to Mordecai, to replace his sackcloth, but he didn’t receive
it. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> Then Esther called for Hathach,
one of the king’s eunuchs, whom he had appointed to attend her, and
commanded him to go to Mordecai, to find out what this was, and why it
was.</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">6</span> So Hathach went out to Mordecai, to
the city square which was before the king’s gate. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> Mordecai told him of all that had happened
to him, and the exact sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to
the king’s treasuries for the destruction of the Jews. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> He also gave him the copy of the writing of
the decree that was given out in Susa to destroy them, to show it to
Esther, and to declare it to her, and to urge her to go in to the king

<p><span class="bibleverse">9</span> Hathach came and told Esther the
words of Mordecai. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> Then Esther spoke
to Hathach, and gave him a message to Mordecai: <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> “All the king’s servants and the people of
the king’s provinces know that whoever, whether man or woman, comes to
the king into the inner court without being called, there is one law for
him, that he be put to death, except those to whom the king might hold
out the golden scepter, that he may live. I have not been called to come
in to the king these thirty days.”</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">12</span> They told Esther’s words to
Mordecai. <span class="bibleverse">13</span> Then Mordecai asked them to
return this answer to Esther: “Don’t think to yourself that you will
escape in the king’s house any more than all the Jews. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> For if you remain silent now, then relief
and deliverance will come to the Jews from another place, but you and
your father’s house will perish. Who knows if you haven’t come to the
kingdom for such a time as this?” <span class="bibleverse">15</span>
Then Esther asked them to answer Mordecai, <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> “Go, gather together all the Jews who are
present in Susa, and fast for me, and neither eat nor drink three days,
night or day. I and my maidens will also fast the same way. Then I will
go in to the king, which is against the law; and if I perish, I perish.”
<span class="bibleverse">17</span> So Mordecai went his way, and did
according to all that Esther had commanded him.</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Now on the third day, Esther put on
her royal clothing and stood in the inner court of the king’s house,
next to the king’s house. The king sat on his royal throne in the royal
house, next to the entrance of the house. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> When the king saw Esther the queen standing
in the court, she obtained favor in his sight; and the king held out to
Esther the golden scepter that was in his hand. So Esther came near and
touched the top of the scepter. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> Then
the king asked her, “What would you like, queen Esther? What is your
request? It shall be given you even to the half of the kingdom.” <span

let the king and Haman come today to the banquet that I have prepared

Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared. <span

wine, “What is your petition? It shall be granted you. What is your
request? Even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.” <span

<p><span class="bibleverse">9</span> Then Haman went out that day joyful
and glad of heart, but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king’s gate, that
he didn’t stand up nor move for him, he was filled with wrath against
Mordecai. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> Nevertheless Haman
restrained himself, and went home. There, he sent and called for his
friends and Zeresh his wife. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> Haman
recounted to them the glory of his riches, the multitude of his
children, all the things in which the king had promoted him, and how he
had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king. <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> Haman also said, “Yes, Esther the queen let
no man come in with the king to the banquet that she had prepared but
myself; and tomorrow I am also invited by her together with the king.
<span class="bibleverse">13</span> Yet all this avails me nothing, so
long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king’s gate.” <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> Then Zeresh his wife and all his friends
said to him, “Let a gallows be made fifty cubits<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>
high, and in the morning speak to the king about hanging Mordecai on it.
Then go in merrily with the king to the banquet.” This pleased Haman, so
he had the gallows made.</p>
<h1 id="section-5">6</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> On that night, the king couldn’t
sleep. He commanded the book of records of the chronicles to be brought,
and they were read to the king. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> It was
found written that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the
king’s eunuchs, who were doorkeepers, who had tried to lay hands on the
King Ahasuerus. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> The king said, “What
honor and dignity has been given to Mordecai for this?” Then the king’s
servants who attended him said, “Nothing has been done for him.” <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> The king said, “Who is in the court?” Now
Haman had come into the outer court of the king’s house, to speak to the
king about hanging Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him.
<span class="bibleverse">5</span> The king’s servants said to him,
“Behold,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> Haman stands in the court.” The king
said, “Let him come in.” <span class="bibleverse">6</span> So Haman came
in. The king said to him, “What shall be done to the man whom the king
delights to honor?” Now Haman said in his heart, “Who would the king
delight to honor more than myself?” <span class="bibleverse">7</span>
Haman said to the king, “For the man whom the king delights to honor,
<span class="bibleverse">8</span> let royal clothing be brought which
the king uses to wear, and the horse that the king rides on, and on the
head of which a royal crown is set. <span class="bibleverse">9</span>
Let the clothing and the horse be delivered to the hand of one of the
king’s most noble princes, that they may array the man whom the king
delights to honor with them, and have him ride on horseback through the
city square, and proclaim before him, ‘Thus it shall be done to the man
whom the king delights to honor!’” <span class="bibleverse">10</span>
Then the king said to Haman, “Hurry and take the clothing and the horse,
as you have said, and do this for Mordecai the Jew, who sits at the
king’s gate. Let nothing fail of all that you have spoken.” <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> Then Haman took the clothing and the horse,
and arrayed Mordecai, and had him ride through the city square, and
proclaimed before him, “Thus it shall be done to the man whom the king
delights to honor!” <span class="bibleverse">12</span> Mordecai came
back to the king’s gate, but Haman hurried to his house, mourning and
having his head covered. <span class="bibleverse">13</span> Haman
recounted to Zeresh his wife and all his friends everything that had
happened to him. Then his wise men and Zeresh his wife said to him, “If
Mordecai, before whom you have begun to fall, is of Jewish descent, you
will not prevail against him, but you will surely fall before him.”
<span class="bibleverse">14</span> While they were yet talking with him,
the king’s eunuchs came, and hurried to bring Haman to the banquet that
Esther had prepared.</p>
<h1 id="section-6">7</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> So the king and Haman came to
banquet with Esther the queen. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> The
king said again to Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine,
“What is your petition, queen Esther? It shall be granted you. What is
your request? Even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.”
<span class="bibleverse">3</span> Then Esther the queen answered, “If I
have found favor in your sight, O king, and if it pleases the king, let
my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request. <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> For we are sold, I and my people, to be
destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for male
and female slaves, I would have held my peace, although the adversary
could not have compensated for the king’s loss.” <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> Then King Ahasuerus said to Esther the
queen, “Who is he, and where is he who dared presume in his heart to do
so?” <span class="bibleverse">6</span> Esther said, “An adversary and an
enemy, even this wicked Haman!” Then Haman was afraid before the king
and the queen. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> The king arose in his
wrath from the banquet of wine and went into the palace garden. Haman
stood up to make request for his life to Esther the queen, for he saw
that there was evil determined against him by the king. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> Then the king returned out of the palace
garden into the place of the banquet of wine; and Haman had fallen on
the couch where Esther was. Then the king said, “Will he even assault
the queen in front of me in the house?” As the word went out of the
king’s mouth, they covered Haman’s face. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> Then Harbonah, one of the eunuchs who were
with the king, said, “Behold, the gallows fifty cubits<a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>
high, which Haman has made for Mordecai, who spoke good for the king, is
standing at Haman’s house.” The king said, “Hang him on it!” <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he
had prepared for Mordecai. Then the king’s wrath was pacified.</p>
<h1 id="section-7">8</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> On that day, King Ahasuerus gave
the house of Haman, the Jews’ enemy, to Esther the queen. Mordecai came
before the king; for Esther had told what he was to her. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> The king took off his ring, which he had
taken from Haman, and gave it to Mordecai. Esther set Mordecai over the
house of Haman. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> Esther spoke yet again
before the king, and fell down at his feet and begged him with tears to
put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite, and his plan that he had
planned against the Jews. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> Then the
king held out to Esther the golden scepter. So Esther arose, and stood
before the king. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> She said, “If it
pleases the king, and if I have found favor in his sight, and the thing
seems right to the king, and I am pleasing in his eyes, let it be
written to reverse the letters devised by Haman, the son of Hammedatha
the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews who are in all the
king’s provinces. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> For how can I endure
to see the evil that would come to my people? How can I endure to see
the destruction of my relatives?” <span class="bibleverse">7</span> Then
King Ahasuerus said to Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew, “See, I
have given Esther the house of Haman, and they have hanged him on the
gallows because he laid his hand on the Jews. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> Write also to the Jews as it pleases you, in
the king’s name, and seal it with the king’s ring; for the writing which
is written in the king’s name, and sealed with the king’s ring, may not
be reversed by any man.” <span class="bibleverse">9</span> Then the
king’s scribes were called at that time, in the third month, which is
the month Sivan, on the twenty-third day of the month; and it was
written according to all that Mordecai commanded to the Jews, and to the
local governors, and the governors and princes of the provinces which
are from India to Ethiopia, one hundred twenty-seven provinces, to every
province according to its writing, and to every people in their
language, and to the Jews in their writing, and in their language. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> He wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus, and
sealed it with the king’s ring, and sent letters by courier on
horseback, riding on royal horses that were bred from swift steeds.
<span class="bibleverse">11</span> In those letters, the king granted
the Jews who were in every city to gather themselves together and to
defend their lives—to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish all the
power of the people and province that would assault them, their little
ones and women, and to plunder their possessions, <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> on one day in all the provinces of King
Ahasuerus, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the
month Adar. <span class="bibleverse">13</span> A copy of the letter,
that the decree should be given out in every province, was published to
all the peoples, that the Jews should be ready for that day to avenge
themselves on their enemies. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> So the
couriers who rode on royal horses went out, hastened and pressed on by
the king’s commandment. The decree was given out in the citadel of Susa.
<span class="bibleverse">15</span> Mordecai went out of the presence of
the king in royal clothing of blue and white, and with a great crown of
gold, and with a robe of fine linen and purple; and the city of Susa
shouted and was glad. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> The Jews had
light, gladness, joy, and honor.</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">17</span> In every province and in every
city, wherever the king’s commandment and his decree came, the Jews had
gladness, joy, a feast and a holiday. Many from among the peoples of the
land became Jews, for the fear of the Jews had fallen on them.</p>
<h1 id="section-8">9</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Now in the twelfth month, which is
the month Adar, on the thirteenth day of the month, when the king’s
commandment and his decree came near to be put in execution, on the day
that the enemies of the Jews hoped to conquer them, (but it turned out
that the opposite happened, that the Jews conquered those who hated
them), <span class="bibleverse">2</span> the Jews gathered themselves
together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the King
Ahasuerus, to lay hands on those who wanted to harm them. No one could
withstand them, because the fear of them had fallen on all the people.
<span class="bibleverse">3</span> All the princes of the provinces, the
local governors, the governors, and those who did the king’s business
helped the Jews, because the fear of Mordecai had fallen on them. <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> For Mordecai was great in the king’s house,
and his fame went out throughout all the provinces, for the man Mordecai
grew greater and greater. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> The Jews
struck all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, and with
slaughter and destruction, and did what they wanted to those who hated
them. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> In the citadel of Susa, the Jews
killed and destroyed five hundred men. <span class="bibleverse">7</span>
They killed Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha, <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha, <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vaizatha,
<span class="bibleverse">10</span> the ten sons of Haman the son of
Hammedatha, the Jews’ enemy, but they didn’t lay their hand on the
plunder. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> On that day, the number of
those who were slain in the citadel of Susa was brought before the king.
<span class="bibleverse">12</span> The king said to Esther the queen,
“The Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in the citadel of
Susa, including the ten sons of Haman; what then have they done in the
rest of the king’s provinces! Now what is your petition? It shall be
granted you. What is your further request? It shall be done.” <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> Then Esther said, “If it pleases the king,
let it be granted to the Jews who are in Susa to do tomorrow also
according to today’s decree, and let Haman’s ten sons be hanged on the
gallows.” <span class="bibleverse">14</span> The king commanded this to
be done. A decree was given out in Susa; and they hanged Haman’s ten
sons. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> The Jews who were in Susa
gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month
Adar, and killed three hundred men in Susa; but they didn’t lay their
hand on the plunder. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> The other Jews
who were in the king’s provinces gathered themselves together, defended
their lives, had rest from their enemies, and killed seventy-five
thousand of those who hated them; but they didn’t lay their hand on the
plunder. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> This was done on the
thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth day of that
month they rested and made it a day of feasting and gladness. <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> But the Jews who were in Susa assembled
together on the thirteenth and on the fourteenth days of the month; and
on the fifteenth day of that month, they rested, and made it a day of
feasting and gladness. <span class="bibleverse">19</span> Therefore the
Jews of the villages, who live in the unwalled towns, make the
fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of gladness and feasting, a
holiday, and a day of sending presents of food to one another. <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> Mordecai wrote these things, and sent
letters to all the Jews who were in all the provinces of the King
Ahasuerus, both near and far, <span class="bibleverse">21</span> to
enjoin them that they should keep the fourteenth and fifteenth days of
the month Adar yearly, <span class="bibleverse">22</span> as the days in
which the Jews had rest from their enemies, and the month which was
turned to them from sorrow to gladness, and from mourning into a
holiday; that they should make them days of feasting and gladness, and
of sending presents of food to one another, and gifts to the needy.
<span class="bibleverse">23</span> The Jews accepted the custom that
they had begun, as Mordecai had written to them,</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">24</span> because Haman the son of
Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted against
the Jews to destroy them, and had cast “Pur”, that is the lot, to
consume them and to destroy them; <span class="bibleverse">25</span> but
when this became known to the king, he commanded by letters that his
wicked plan, which he had planned against the Jews, should return on his
own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.
<span class="bibleverse">26</span> Therefore they called these days
“Purim”,<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> from the word “Pur.” Therefore
because of all the words of this letter, and of that which they had seen
concerning this matter, and that which had come to them, <span
class="bibleverse">27</span> the Jews established and imposed on
themselves, on their descendants, and on all those who joined themselves
to them, so that it should not fail that they would keep these two days
according to what was written and according to its appointed time every
year; <span class="bibleverse">28</span> and that these days should be
remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every
province, and every city; and that these days of Purim should not fail

confirm this second letter of Purim. <span class="bibleverse">30</span>
He sent letters to all the Jews in the hundred twenty-seven provinces of
the kingdom of Ahasuerus with words of peace and truth, <span

appointed times, as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had decreed,
and as they had imposed upon themselves and their descendants in the
