<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> The elder, to the chosen lady and
her children, whom I love in truth, and not I only, but also all those
who know the truth, <span class="bibleverse">2</span> for the truth’s
sake, which remains in us, and it will be with us forever: <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us,
from God the Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ,<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> the
Son of the Father, in truth and love.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">4</span> I rejoice greatly that I have found
some of your children walking in truth, even as we have been commanded
by the Father. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> Now I beg you, dear
lady, not as though I wrote to you a new commandment, but that which we
had from the beginning, that we love one another. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> This is love, that we should walk according
to his commandments. This is the commandment, even as you heard from the
beginning, that you should walk in it.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">7</span> For many deceivers have gone out
into the world, those who don’t confess that Jesus Christ came in the
flesh. This is the deceiver and the Antichrist. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> Watch yourselves, that we don’t lose the
things which we have accomplished, but that we receive a full reward.
<span class="bibleverse">9</span> Whoever transgresses and doesn’t
remain in the teaching of Christ doesn’t have God. He who remains in the
teaching has both the Father and the Son. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> If anyone comes to you and doesn’t bring
this teaching, don’t receive him into your house, and don’t welcome him,
<span class="bibleverse">11</span> for he who welcomes him participates
in his evil deeds.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">12</span> Having many things to write to
you, I don’t want to do so with paper and ink, but I hope to come to you
and to speak face to face, that our joy may be made full. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> The children of your chosen sister greet
you. Amen.</p>
