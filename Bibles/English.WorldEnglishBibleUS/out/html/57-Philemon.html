<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Paul, a prisoner of Christ<a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to
Philemon, our beloved fellow worker, <span class="bibleverse">2</span>
to the beloved Apphia, to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the
assembly in your house: <span class="bibleverse">3</span> Grace to you
and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<h2 id="thank-god-and-intercession-for-filemon">Thank God and
intercession for Filemon</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">4</span> I thank my God always, making
mention of you in my prayers, <span class="bibleverse">5</span> hearing
of your love and of the faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and
toward all the saints, <span class="bibleverse">6</span> that the
fellowship of your faith may become effective in the knowledge of every
good thing which is in us in Christ Jesus. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> For we have much joy and comfort in your
love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you,
brother.</p>
<h2 id="defense-of-onesimus">Defense of Onesimus</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">8</span> Therefore though I have all
boldness in Christ to command you that which is appropriate, <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> yet for love’s sake I rather appeal to you,
being such a one as Paul, the aged, but also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.
<span class="bibleverse">10</span> I appeal to you for my child
Onesimus, whom I have become the father of in my chains,<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>
<span class="bibleverse">11</span> who once was useless to you, but now
is useful to you and to me. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> I am
sending him back. Therefore receive him, that is, my own heart, <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> whom I desired to keep with me, that on
your behalf he might serve me in my chains for the Good News. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> But I was willing to do nothing without
your consent, that your goodness would not be as of necessity, but of
free will. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> For perhaps he was
therefore separated from you for a while that you would have him
forever, <span class="bibleverse">16</span> no longer as a slave, but
more than a slave, a beloved brother—especially to me, but how much
rather to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord. <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> If then you count me a partner, receive him
as you would receive me. <span class="bibleverse">18</span> But if he
has wronged you at all or owes you anything, put that to my account.
<span class="bibleverse">19</span> I, Paul, write this with my own hand:
I will repay it (not to mention to you that you owe to me even your own
self besides). <span class="bibleverse">20</span> Yes, brother, let me
have joy from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in the Lord.</p>
<h2
id="closing-letters-announcement-of-visit-greetings-and-blessings">Closing
letters, announcement of visit, greetings and blessings</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">21</span> Having confidence in your
obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even beyond what I
say. <span class="bibleverse">22</span> Also, prepare a guest room for
me, for I hope that through your prayers I will be restored to you.
<span class="bibleverse">23</span> Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in
Christ Jesus, greets you, <span class="bibleverse">24</span> as do Mark,
Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers. <span
class="bibleverse">25</span> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with
your spirit. Amen.</p>
