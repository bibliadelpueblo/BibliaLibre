Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus
Christ.</p>
<h2
id="thanksgiving-trust-and-intercession-of-the-apostle-for-the-church">Thanksgiving,
trust and intercession of the apostle for the church</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">3</span> I thank my God whenever I remember
you, <span class="bibleverse">4</span> always in every request of mine
on behalf of you all, making my requests with joy, <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> for your partnership<a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> in
furtherance of the Good News from the first day until now; <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> being confident of this very thing, that he
who began a good work in you will complete it until the day of Jesus
Christ. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> It is even right for me to
think this way on behalf of all of you, because I have you in my heart,
because both in my bonds and in the defense and confirmation of the Good
News, you all are partakers with me of grace. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> For God is my witness, how I long after all
of you in the tender mercies of Christ Jesus. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> This I pray, that your love may abound yet
more and more in knowledge and all discernment, <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> so that you may approve the things that are
excellent, that you may be sincere and without offense to the day of
Christ, <span class="bibleverse">11</span> being filled with the fruits
of righteousness which are through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise
of God.</p>
<h2 id="the-pains-of-the-apostle-and-the-overwhelming-joys-in-rome">The
pains of the apostle and the overwhelming joys in Rome</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">12</span> Now I desire to have you know,
brothers,<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> that the things which happened to me
have turned out rather to the progress of the Good News, <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> so that it became evident to the whole
palace<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> guard, and to all the rest, that my
bonds are in Christ, <span class="bibleverse">14</span> and that most of
the brothers in the Lord, being confident through my bonds, are more
abundantly bold to speak the word of God without fear. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> Some indeed preach Christ even out of envy
and strife, and some also out of good will. <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> The former insincerely preach Christ from
selfish ambition, thinking that they add affliction to my chains; <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> but the latter out of love, knowing that I
am appointed for the defense of the Good News.</p>
<h2
id="both-the-testimony-of-pauls-death-and-his-continued-life-will-serve-to-glorify-christ">Both
the testimony of Paul's death and his continued life will serve to
glorify Christ</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">18</span> What does it matter? Only that in
every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed. I
rejoice in this, yes, and will rejoice. <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> For I know that this will turn out to my
salvation through your prayers and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus
Christ, <span class="bibleverse">20</span> according to my earnest
expectation and hope, that I will in no way be disappointed, but with
all boldness, as always, now also Christ will be magnified in my body,
whether by life or by death. <span class="bibleverse">21</span> For to
me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> But if I live on in the flesh, this will
bring fruit from my work; yet I don’t know what I will choose. <span
class="bibleverse">23</span> But I am hard pressed between the two,
having the desire to depart and be with Christ, which is far better.
<span class="bibleverse">24</span> Yet to remain in the flesh is more
needful for your sake. <span class="bibleverse">25</span> Having this
confidence, I know that I will remain, yes, and remain with you all for
your progress and joy in the faith, <span class="bibleverse">26</span>
that your boasting<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> may abound in Christ Jesus in me
through my presence with you again.</p>
<h2
id="reminder-to-walk-with-dignity-and-fight-unanimously-for-the-message-of-salvation-under-all-external-hostility">Reminder
to walk with dignity and fight unanimously for the message of salvation
under all external hostility</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">27</span> Only let your way of life be
worthy of the Good News of Christ, that whether I come and see you or am
absent, I may hear of your state, that you stand firm in one spirit,
with one soul striving for the faith of the Good News; <span
class="bibleverse">28</span> and in nothing frightened by the
adversaries, which is for them a proof of destruction, but to you of
salvation, and that from God. <span class="bibleverse">29</span> Because
it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ, not only to believe in
him, but also to suffer on his behalf, <span
class="bibleverse">30</span> having the same conflict which you saw in
me and now hear is in me.</p>
<h1 id="section-1">2</h1>
<h2
id="reminder-of-unity-within-the-community-of-self-sacrifice-and-willingness-to-suffer-according-to-the-example-of-christ">Reminder
of unity within the community, of self-sacrifice and willingness to
suffer according to the example of Christ</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> If therefore there is any
exhortation in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship of
the Spirit, if any tender mercies and compassion, <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> make my joy full by being like-minded,
having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind; <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> doing nothing through rivalry or through
conceit, but in humility, each counting others better than himself;
<span class="bibleverse">4</span> each of you not just looking to his
own things, but each of you also to the things of others. <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> Have this in your mind, which was also in
Christ Jesus, <span class="bibleverse">6</span> who, existing in the
form of God, didn’t consider equality with God a thing to be grasped,
<span class="bibleverse">7</span> but emptied himself, taking the form
of a servant, being made in the likeness of men. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> And being found in human form, he humbled
himself, becoming obedient to the point of death, yes, the death of the
cross. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> Therefore God also highly
exalted him, and gave to him the name which is above every name, <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> that at the name of Jesus every knee should
bow, of those in heaven, those on earth, and those under the earth,
<span class="bibleverse">11</span> and that every tongue should confess
that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</p>
<h2
id="admonishment-to-willing-obedience-and-to-be-completely-serious-about-christianity">Admonishment
to willing obedience and to be completely serious about
Christianity</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">12</span> So then, my beloved, even as you
have always obeyed, not only in my presence, but now much more in my
absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> For it is God who works in you both to will
and to work for his good pleasure. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> Do
all things without complaining and arguing, <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> that you may become blameless and harmless,
children of God without defect in the middle of a crooked and perverse
generation, among whom you are seen as lights in the world, <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> holding up the word of life, that I may
have something to boast in the day of Christ that I didn’t run in vain
nor labor in vain. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> Yes, and if I am
poured out on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I am glad and
rejoice with you all. <span class="bibleverse">18</span> In the same
way, you also should be glad and rejoice with me.</p>
<h2
id="information-on-timothys-intended-mission-and-epaphrodituss-return">Information
on Timothy's intended mission and Epaphroditus's return</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">19</span> But I hope in the Lord Jesus to
send Timothy to you soon, that I also may be cheered up when I know how
you are doing. <span class="bibleverse">20</span> For I have no one else
like-minded, who will truly care about you. <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> For they all seek their own, not the things
of Jesus Christ. <span class="bibleverse">22</span> But you know that he
has proved himself. As a child serves a father, so he served with me in
furtherance of the Good News. <span class="bibleverse">23</span>
Therefore I hope to send him at once, as soon as I see how it will go
with me. <span class="bibleverse">24</span> But I trust in the Lord that
I myself also will come shortly. <span class="bibleverse">25</span> But
I thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, fellow
worker, fellow soldier, and your apostle and servant of my need, <span
class="bibleverse">26</span> since he longed for you all, and was very
troubled because you had heard that he was sick. <span
class="bibleverse">27</span> For indeed he was sick nearly to death, but
God had mercy on him, and not on him only, but on me also, that I might
not have sorrow on sorrow. <span class="bibleverse">28</span> I have
sent him therefore the more diligently, that when you see him again, you
may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful. <span
class="bibleverse">29</span> Receive him therefore in the Lord with all
joy, and hold such people in honor, <span class="bibleverse">30</span>
because for the work of Christ he came near to death, risking his life
to supply that which was lacking in your service toward me.</p>

out for joy in the Lord; Invalidity of the external virtues and justice
of the law in comparison with the knowledge of salvation in Christ;
Warning Against Judaist False Teachers</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Finally, my brothers, rejoice in
the Lord! To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not tiresome,
but for you it is safe. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> Beware of the
dogs; beware of the evil workers; beware of the false circumcision.
<span class="bibleverse">3</span> For we are the circumcision, who
worship God in the Spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no
confidence in the flesh; <span class="bibleverse">4</span> though I
myself might have confidence even in the flesh. If any other man thinks
that he has confidence in the flesh, I yet more: <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of
Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; concerning the
law, a Pharisee; <span class="bibleverse">6</span> concerning zeal,
persecuting the assembly; concerning the righteousness which is in the
law, found blameless. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> However, I
consider those things that were gain to me as a loss for Christ. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> Yes most certainly, and I count all things
to be a loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus, my
Lord, for whom I suffered the loss of all things, and count them nothing
but refuse, that I may gain Christ <span class="bibleverse">9</span> and
be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own, that which is of
the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness
which is from God by faith, <span class="bibleverse">10</span> that I
may know him and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of
his sufferings, becoming conformed to his death, <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> if by any means I may attain to the
resurrection from the dead.</p>
<h2
id="the-apostle-strives-for-this-perfection-encouragement-to-continue-walking-successfully-in-firm-fidelity">The
apostle strives for this perfection; Encouragement to continue walking
successfully in firm fidelity</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">12</span> Not that I have already obtained,
or am already made perfect; but I press on, that I may take hold of that
for which also I was taken hold of by Christ Jesus. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> Brothers, I don’t regard myself as yet
having taken hold, but one thing I do: forgetting the things which are
behind and stretching forward to the things which are before, <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> I press on toward the goal for the prize of
the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> Let us therefore, as many as are perfect,
think this way. If in anything you think otherwise, God will also reveal
that to you. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> Nevertheless, to the
extent that we have already attained, let’s walk by the same rule. Let’s
be of the same mind.</p>
<h2 id="admonitions-to-switch-to-the-sky">Admonitions to switch to the
sky</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">17</span> Brothers, be imitators together of
me, and note those who walk this way, even as you have us for an
example. <span class="bibleverse">18</span> For many walk, of whom I
told you often, and now tell you even weeping, as the enemies of the
cross of Christ, <span class="bibleverse">19</span> whose end is
destruction, whose god is the belly, and whose glory is in their shame,
who think about earthly things. <span class="bibleverse">20</span> For
our citizenship is in heaven, from where we also wait for a Savior, the
Lord Jesus Christ, <span class="bibleverse">21</span> who will change
the body of our humiliation to be conformed to the body of his glory,
according to the working by which he is able even to subject all things
to himself.</p>
<h1 id="section-3">4</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Therefore, my brothers, beloved and
longed for, my joy and crown, stand firm in the Lord in this way, my
beloved.</p>
<h2
id="warning-to-individual-parishioners-invitation-to-joy-in-the-lord-promise-of-gods-peace-as-a-reward-for-continuous-prayer-and-virtuous-walk">Warning
to individual parishioners; Invitation to joy in the Lord; Promise of
God's peace as a reward for continuous prayer and virtuous walk</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">2</span> I exhort Euodia, and I exhort
Syntyche, to think the same way in the Lord. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> Yes, I beg you also, true partner, help
these women, for they labored with me in the Good News with Clement
also, and the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the book of
life. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> Rejoice in the Lord always!
Again I will say, “Rejoice!” <span class="bibleverse">5</span> Let your
gentleness be known to all men. The Lord is at hand. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> In nothing be anxious, but in everything, by
prayer and petition with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known
to God. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> And the peace of God, which
surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your thoughts in
Christ Jesus. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> Finally, brothers,
whatever things are true, whatever things are honorable, whatever things
are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever
things are of good report: if there is any virtue and if there is
anything worthy of praise, think about these things. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> Do the things which you learned, received,
heard, and saw in me, and the God of peace will be with you.</p>
<h2
id="expression-of-joy-and-gratitude-for-the-gift-of-love-sent-by-the-congregation">Expression
of joy and gratitude for the gift of love sent by the congregation</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">10</span> But I rejoice in the Lord greatly
that now at length you have revived your thought for me; in which you
did indeed take thought, but you lacked opportunity. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> Not that I speak because of lack, for I
have learned in whatever state I am, to be content in it. <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> I know how to be humbled, and I also know
how to abound. In any and all circumstances I have learned the secret
both to be filled and to be hungry, both to abound and to be in need.
<span class="bibleverse">13</span> I can do all things through Christ
who strengthens me. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> However you did
well that you shared in my affliction. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> You yourselves also know, you Philippians,
that in the beginning of the Good News, when I departed from Macedonia,
no assembly shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving but you
only. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> For even in Thessalonica you
sent once and again to my need. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> Not
that I seek for the gift, but I seek for the fruit that increases to
your account. <span class="bibleverse">18</span> But I have all things
and abound. I am filled, having received from Epaphroditus the things
that came from you, a sweet-smelling fragrance, an acceptable and
well-pleasing sacrifice to God. <span class="bibleverse">19</span> My
God will supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in
Christ Jesus. <span class="bibleverse">20</span> Now to our God and
Father be the glory forever and ever! Amen.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-greetings-and-blessing">Conclusion: greetings and
blessing</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">21</span> Greet every saint in Christ Jesus.
The brothers who are with me greet you. <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> All the saints greet you, especially those
who are of Caesar’s household. <span class="bibleverse">23</span> The
grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.</p>
