as cupbearer to King Artaxerxes in Susa; his sorrow for the misfortune
of his country</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> The words of Nehemiah the son of
Hacaliah. Now in the month Chislev, in the twentieth year, as I was in
Susa the palace, <span class="bibleverse">2</span> Hanani, one of my
brothers, came, he and certain men out of Judah; and I asked them about
the Jews who had escaped, who were left of the captivity, and concerning
Jerusalem. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> They said to me, “The
remnant who are left of the captivity there in the province are in great
affliction and reproach. The wall of Jerusalem is also broken down, and
its gates are burned with fire.” <span class="bibleverse">4</span> When
I heard these words, I sat down and wept, and mourned several days; and
I fasted and prayed before the God<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> of heaven,</p>
<h2 id="nehemiahs-penance-and-supplication">Nehemiah's penance and
supplication</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">5</span> and said, “I beg you, Yahweh,<a
href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> the God of heaven, the great and
awesome God who keeps covenant and loving kindness with those who love
him and keep his commandments, <span class="bibleverse">6</span> let
your ear now be attentive and your eyes open, that you may listen to the
prayer of your servant which I pray before you at this time, day and
night, for the children of Israel your servants, while I confess the
sins of the children of Israel which we have sinned against you. Yes, I
and my father’s house have sinned. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> We
have dealt very corruptly against you, and have not kept the
commandments, nor the statutes, nor the ordinances, which you commanded
your servant Moses. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> “Remember, I beg
you, the word that you commanded your servant Moses, saying, ‘If you
trespass, I will scatter you among the peoples; <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> but if you return to me, and keep my
commandments and do them, though your outcasts were in the uttermost
part of the heavens, yet I will gather them from there, and will bring
them to the place that I have chosen, to cause my name to dwell there.’
<span class="bibleverse">10</span> “Now these are your servants and your
people, whom you have redeemed by your great power and by your strong
hand. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> Lord,<a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> I
beg you, let your ear be attentive now to the prayer of your servant,
and to the prayer of your servants who delight to fear your name; and
please prosper your servant today, and grant him mercy in the sight of
this man.” Now I was cup bearer to the king.</p>

restore Jerusalem</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> In the month Nisan, in the
twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, when wine was before him, I
picked up the wine, and gave it to the king. Now I had not been sad
before in his presence. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> The king said
to me, “Why is your face sad, since you are not sick? This is nothing
else but sorrow of heart.” Then I was very much afraid. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> I said to the king, “Let the king live
forever! Why shouldn’t my face be sad, when the city, the place of my
fathers’ tombs, lies waste, and its gates have been consumed with fire?”
<span class="bibleverse">4</span> Then the king said to me, “What is
your request?” So I prayed to the God of heaven. <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> I said to the king, “If it pleases the king,
and if your servant has found favor in your sight, I ask that you would
send me to Judah, to the city of my fathers’ tombs, that I may build
it.” <span class="bibleverse">6</span> The king said to me (the queen
was also sitting by him), “How long will your journey be? When will you
return?” So it pleased the king to send me, and I set a time for him.
<span class="bibleverse">7</span> Moreover I said to the king, “If it
pleases the king, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the
River, that they may let me pass through until I come to Judah; <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> and a letter to Asaph the keeper of the
king’s forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of
the citadel by the temple, for the wall of the city, and for the house
that I will occupy.” The king granted my requests, because of the good
hand of my God on me. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> Then I came to
the governors beyond the River, and gave them the king’s letters. Now
the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the
Ammonite servant heard of it, it grieved them exceedingly, because a man
had come to seek the welfare of the children of Israel.</p>

night tour of the city walls; his call to the national comrades to

<p><span class="bibleverse">11</span> So I came to Jerusalem, and was
there three days. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> I arose in the
night, I and a few men with me. I didn’t tell anyone what my God put
into my heart to do for Jerusalem. There wasn’t any animal with me
except the animal that I rode on. <span class="bibleverse">13</span> I
went out by night by the valley gate toward the jackal’s well, then to
the dung gate; and I inspected the walls of Jerusalem, which were broken
down, and its gates were consumed with fire. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> Then I went on to the spring gate and to
the king’s pool, but there was no place for the animal that was under me
to pass. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> Then I went up in the night
by the brook and inspected the wall; and I turned back, and entered by
the valley gate, and so returned. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> The
rulers didn’t know where I went, or what I did. I had not as yet told it
to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers,
nor to the rest who did the work. <span class="bibleverse">17</span>
Then I said to them, “You see the bad situation that we are in, how
Jerusalem lies waste, and its gates are burned with fire. Come, let’s
build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we won’t be disgraced.”</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">18</span> I told them about the hand of my
God which was good on me, and also about the king’s words that he had
spoken to me. They said, “Let’s rise up and build.” So they strengthened
their hands for the good work. <span class="bibleverse">19</span> But
when Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the Ammonite servant, and Geshem the
Arabian, heard it, they ridiculed us and despised us, and said, “What is
this thing that you are doing? Will you rebel against the king?” <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> Then I answered them, and said to them,
“The God of heaven will prosper us. Therefore we, his servants, will
arise and build; but you have no portion, nor right, nor memorial in
Jerusalem.”</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Then Eliashib the high priest rose
up with his brothers the priests, and they built the sheep gate. They
sanctified it, and set up its doors. They sanctified it even to the

the stairs that go down from David’s city. <span

them, Azariah the son of Maaseiah the son of Ananiah made repairs beside
his own house. <span class="bibleverse">24</span> After him, Binnui the

house of the king, which is by the court of the guard. After him Pedaiah
the son of Parosh made repairs. <span class="bibleverse">26</span> (Now
the temple servants lived in Ophel, to the place opposite the water gate

of wall construction despite ridicule and hostility from pagan
opponents</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> But when Sanballat heard that we
were building the wall, he was angry, and was very indignant, and mocked
the Jews. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> He spoke before his brothers
and the army of Samaria, and said, “What are these feeble Jews doing?
Will they fortify themselves? Will they sacrifice? Will they finish in a
day? Will they revive the stones out of the heaps of rubbish, since they
are burned?” <span class="bibleverse">3</span> Now Tobiah the Ammonite
was by him, and he said, “What they are building, if a fox climbed up
it, he would break down their stone wall.” <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> “Hear, our God, for we are despised. Turn
back their reproach on their own head. Give them up for a plunder in a
land of captivity. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> Don’t cover their
iniquity. Don’t let their sin be blotted out from before you; for they
have insulted the builders.” <span class="bibleverse">6</span> So we
built the wall; and all the wall was joined together to half its height,
for the people had a mind to work.</p>
<h2

attacks by opponents on the building; Nehemia's successful measures

<p><span class="bibleverse">7</span> But when Sanballat, Tobiah, the
Arabians, the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites heard that the repairing of
the walls of Jerusalem went forward, and that the breaches began to be
filled, they were very angry; <span class="bibleverse">8</span> and they
all conspired together to come and fight against Jerusalem, and to cause
confusion among us. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> But we made our
prayer to our God, and set a watch against them day and night because of
them. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> Judah said, “The strength of
the bearers of burdens is fading and there is much rubble, so that we
are not able to build the wall.” <span class="bibleverse">11</span> Our
adversaries said, “They will not know or see, until we come in among
them and kill them, and cause the work to cease.” <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> When the Jews who lived by them came, they
said to us ten times from all places, “Wherever you turn, they will
attack us.” <span class="bibleverse">13</span> Therefore I set guards in
the lowest parts of the space behind the wall, in the open places. I set
the people by family groups with their swords, their spears, and their
bows. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> I looked, and rose up, and said
to the nobles, to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, “Don’t be
afraid of them! Remember the Lord, who is great and awesome, and fight
for your brothers, your sons, your daughters, your wives, and your
houses.” <span class="bibleverse">15</span> When our enemies heard that
it was known to us, and God had brought their counsel to nothing, all of
us returned to the wall, everyone to his work. <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> From that time forth, half of my servants
did the work, and half of them held the spears, the shields, the bows,
and the coats of mail; and the rulers were behind all the house of
Judah. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> Those who built the wall, and
those who bore burdens loaded themselves; everyone with one of his hands
did the work, and with the other held his weapon. <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> Among the builders, everyone wore his sword
at his side, and so built. He who sounded the trumpet was by me. <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> I said to the nobles, and to the rulers and
to the rest of the people, “The work is great and widely spread out, and
we are separated on the wall, far from one another. <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> Wherever you hear the sound of the trumpet,
rally there to us. Our God will fight for us.” <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> So we did the work. Half of the people held
the spears from the rising of the morning until the stars appeared.
<span class="bibleverse">22</span> Likewise at the same time I said to
the people, “Let everyone with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that
in the night they may be a guard to us, and may labor in the day.” <span
class="bibleverse">23</span> So neither I, nor my brothers, nor my
servants, nor the men of the guard who followed me took off our clothes.
Everyone took his weapon to the water.</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Then there arose a great cry of the
people and of their wives against their brothers the Jews. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> For there were some who said, “We, our sons
and our daughters, are many. Let us get grain, that we may eat and
live.” <span class="bibleverse">3</span> There were also some who said,
“We are mortgaging our fields, our vineyards, and our houses. Let us get
grain, because of the famine.” <span class="bibleverse">4</span> There
were also some who said, “We have borrowed money for the king’s tribute
using our fields and our vineyards as collateral. <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our
brothers, our children as their children. Behold,<a href="#fn5"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> we
bring our sons and our daughters into bondage to be servants, and some
of our daughters have been brought into bondage. It is also not in our

vineyards.”</p>
<h2

<p><span class="bibleverse">6</span> I was very angry when I heard their
cry and these words. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> Then I consulted
with myself, and contended with the nobles and the rulers, and said to
them, “You exact usury, everyone of his brother.” I held a great
assembly against them. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> I said to them,
“We, after our ability, have redeemed our brothers the Jews that were
sold to the nations; and would you even sell your brothers, and should
they be sold to us?” Then they held their peace, and found not a word to
say. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> Also I said, “The thing that you
do is not good. Shouldn’t you walk in the fear of our God because of the
reproach of the nations, our enemies? <span class="bibleverse">10</span>
I likewise, my brothers and my servants, lend them money and grain.
Please let us stop this usury. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> Please
restore to them, even today, their fields, their vineyards, their olive
groves, and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money, and of
the grain, the new wine, and the oil, that you are charging them.” <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> Then they said, “We will restore them, and
will require nothing of them. We will do so, even as you say.” Then I
called the priests, and took an oath of them, that they would do
according to this promise. <span class="bibleverse">13</span> Also I
shook out my lap, and said, “So may God shake out every man from his
house, and from his labor, that doesn’t perform this promise; even may
he be shaken out and emptied like this.” All the assembly said, “Amen,”
and praised Yahweh. The people did according to this promise.</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">14</span> Moreover from the time that I was
appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth
year even to the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes the king, that is,
twelve years, I and my brothers have not eaten the bread of the
governor. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> But the former governors
who were before me were supported by the people, and took bread and wine
from them, plus forty shekels<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> of silver; yes, even
their servants ruled over the people, but I didn’t do so, because of the
fear of God. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> Yes, I also continued in
the work of this wall. We didn’t buy any land. All my servants were
gathered there to the work. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> Moreover
there were at my table, of the Jews and the rulers, one hundred fifty
men, in addition to those who came to us from among the nations that
were around us. <span class="bibleverse">18</span> Now that which was
prepared for one day was one ox and six choice sheep. Also fowls were
prepared for me, and once in ten days a store of all sorts of wine. Yet
for all this, I didn’t demand the governor’s pay, because the bondage
was heavy on this people. <span class="bibleverse">19</span> Remember

<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Now when it was reported to
Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arabian, and to the rest of our enemies
that I had built the wall, and that there was no breach left in it
(though even to that time I had not set up the doors in the gates),
<span class="bibleverse">2</span> Sanballat and Geshem sent to me,
saying, “Come! Let’s meet together in the villages in the plain of Ono.”
But they intended to harm me. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> I sent
messengers to them, saying, “I am doing a great work, so that I can’t
come down. Why should the work cease while I leave it and come down to
you?” <span class="bibleverse">4</span> They sent to me four times like
this; and I answered them the same way. <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> Then Sanballat sent his servant to me the
same way the fifth time with an open letter in his hand, <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> in which was written, “It is reported among
the nations, and Gashmu says it, that you and the Jews intend to rebel.
Because of that, you are building the wall. You would be their king,
according to these words. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> You have
also appointed prophets to proclaim of you at Jerusalem, saying, ‘There
is a king in Judah!’ Now it will be reported to the king according to
these words. Come now therefore, and let’s take counsel together.” <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> Then I sent to him, saying, “There are no
such things done as you say, but you imagine them out of your own
heart.” <span class="bibleverse">9</span> For they all would have made
us afraid, saying, “Their hands will be weakened from the work, that it
not be done.” But now, strengthen my hands.</p>
<h2 id="exposing-a-false-prophet">Exposing a false prophet</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">10</span> I went to the house of Shemaiah
the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabel, who was shut in at his home;
and he said, “Let us meet together in God’s house, within the temple,
and let’s shut the doors of the temple; for they will come to kill you.
Yes, in the night they will come to kill you.” <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> I said, “Should a man like me flee? Who is
there that, being such as I, would go into the temple to save his life?
I will not go in.” <span class="bibleverse">12</span> I discerned, and
behold, God had not sent him, but he pronounced this prophecy against
me. Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> He was hired so that I would be afraid, do
so, and sin, and that they might have material for an evil report, that
they might reproach me. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> “Remember, my
God, Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and also the
prophetess Noadiah and the rest of the prophets that would have put me
in fear.”</p>

nations that were around us were afraid, and they lost their confidence;
for they perceived that this work was done by our God. <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah
sent many letters to Tobiah, and Tobiah’s letters came to them. <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> For there were many in Judah sworn to him
because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah the son of Arah; and his son
Jehohanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah as
wife. <span class="bibleverse">19</span> Also they spoke of his good
deeds before me, and reported my words to him. Tobiah sent letters to

<span class="bibleverse">60</span> All the temple servants and the

Melah, Tel Harsha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer; but they could not show
their fathers’ houses, nor their offspring,<a href="#fn7"

whether they were of Israel: <span class="bibleverse">62</span> The

the children of Hobaiah, the children of Hakkoz, the children of
Barzillai, who took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite,
and was called after their name. <span class="bibleverse">64</span>
These searched for their genealogical records, but couldn’t find them.
Therefore they were deemed disqualified and removed from the priesthood.
<span class="bibleverse">65</span> The governor told them not to eat of
the most holy things until a priest stood up to minister with Urim and
Thummim. <span class="bibleverse">66</span> The whole assembly together
was forty-two thousand three hundred sixty, <span
class="bibleverse">67</span> in addition to their male servants and
their female servants, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred
thirty-seven. They had two hundred forty-five singing men and singing
women. <span class="bibleverse">68</span> Their horses were seven
hundred thirty-six; their mules, two hundred forty-five; <span
class="bibleverse">69</span> their camels, four hundred thirty-five;
their donkeys, six thousand seven hundred twenty. <span
class="bibleverse">70</span> Some from among the heads of fathers’
households gave to the work. The governor gave to the treasury one
thousand darics of gold,<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> fifty basins, and five hundred
thirty priests’ garments. <span class="bibleverse">71</span> Some of the

class="bibleverse">72</span> That which the rest of the people gave was
twenty thousand darics of gold, plus two thousand minas of silver, and
sixty-seven priests’ garments. <span class="bibleverse">73</span> So the
priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers, some of the people,
the temple servants, and all Israel lived in their cities. When the
seventh month had come, the children of Israel were in their cities.</p>

of the law by Ezra and celebration of the Feast of Tabernacles</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> All the people gathered themselves
together as one man into the wide place that was in front of the water
gate; and they spoke to Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of
Moses, which Yahweh had commanded to Israel. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> Ezra the priest brought the law before the
assembly, both men and women, and all who could hear with understanding,
on the first day of the seventh month. <span class="bibleverse">3</span>
He read from it before the wide place that was in front of the water
gate from early morning until midday, in the presence of the men and the
women, and of those who could understand. The ears of all the people
were attentive to the book of the law. <span class="bibleverse">4</span>
Ezra the scribe stood on a pulpit of wood, which they had made for the
purpose; and beside him stood Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Uriah, Hilkiah,
and Maaseiah, on his right hand; and on his left hand, Pedaiah, Mishael,
Malchijah, Hashum, Hashbaddanah, Zechariah, and Meshullam. <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the
people (for he was above all the people), and when he opened it, all the
people stood up. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> Then Ezra blessed
Yahweh, the great God. All the people answered, “Amen, Amen,” with the
lifting up of their hands. They bowed their heads, and worshiped Yahweh
with their faces to the ground. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> Also
Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah,
Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites, caused the
people to understand the law; and the people stayed in their place.
<span class="bibleverse">8</span> They read in the book, in the law of
God, distinctly; and they gave the sense, so that they understood the
reading.</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">9</span> Nehemiah, who was the governor,
Ezra the priest and scribe, and the Levites who taught the people said
to all the people, “Today is holy to Yahweh your God. Don’t mourn, nor
weep.” For all the people wept when they heard the words of the law.
<span class="bibleverse">10</span> Then he said to them, “Go your way.
Eat the fat, drink the sweet, and send portions to him for whom nothing
is prepared, for today is holy to our Lord. Don’t be grieved, for the
joy of Yahweh is your strength.” <span class="bibleverse">11</span> So
the Levites calmed all the people, saying, “Hold your peace, for the day
is holy. Don’t be grieved.” <span class="bibleverse">12</span> All the
people went their way to eat, to drink, to send portions, and to
celebrate, because they had understood the words that were declared to
them.</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">13</span> On the second day, the heads of
fathers’ households of all the people, the priests, and the Levites were
gathered together to Ezra the scribe, to study the words of the law.
<span class="bibleverse">14</span> They found written in the law how
Yahweh had commanded by Moses that the children of Israel should dwell
in booths in the feast of the seventh month; <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> and that they should publish and proclaim
in all their cities and in Jerusalem, saying, “Go out to the mountain,
and get olive branches, branches of wild olive, myrtle branches, palm
branches, and branches of thick trees, to make temporary shelters,<a
href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> as it is written.” <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> So the people went out and brought them,
and made themselves temporary shelters,<a href="#fn11"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>
everyone on the roof of his house, in their courts, in the courts of
God’s house, in the wide place of the water gate, and in the wide place
of Ephraim’s gate. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> All the assembly
of those who had come back out of the captivity made temporary
shelters<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> and lived in the temporary
shelters, for since the days of Joshua the son of Nun to that day the
children of Israel had not done so. There was very great gladness. <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> Also day by day, from the first day to the
last day, he read in the book of the law of God. They kept the feast
seven days; and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly, according to
the ordinance.</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Now in the twenty-fourth day of
this month the children of Israel were assembled with fasting, with
sackcloth, and dirt on them. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> The
offspring of Israel separated themselves from all foreigners and stood
and confessed their sins and the iniquities of their fathers. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> They stood up in their place, and read in
the book of the law of Yahweh their God a fourth part of the day; and a
fourth part they confessed and worshiped Yahweh their God. <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> Then Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah,
Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani of the Levites stood up on the
stairs, and cried with a loud voice to Yahweh their God.</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">5</span> Then the Levites, Jeshua, and
Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah,
said, “Stand up and bless Yahweh your God from everlasting to
everlasting! Blessed be your glorious name, which is exalted above all
blessing and praise! <span class="bibleverse">6</span> You are Yahweh,
even you alone. You have made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all
their army, the earth and all things that are on it, the seas and all
that is in them, and you preserve them all. The army of heaven worships
you. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> You are Yahweh, the God who chose
Abram, brought him out of Ur of the Chaldees, gave him the name of
Abraham, <span class="bibleverse">8</span> found his heart faithful
before you, and made a covenant with him to give the land of the
Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Perizzite, the Jebusite, and
the Girgashite, to give it to his offspring, and have performed your
words, for you are righteous. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> “You saw
the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heard their cry by the Red
Sea, <span class="bibleverse">10</span> and showed signs and wonders
against Pharaoh, against all his servants, and against all the people of
his land, for you knew that they dealt proudly against them, and made a
name for yourself, as it is today. <span class="bibleverse">11</span>
You divided the sea before them, so that they went through the middle of
the sea on the dry land; and you cast their pursuers into the depths, as
a stone into the mighty waters. <span class="bibleverse">12</span>
Moreover, in a pillar of cloud you led them by day; and in a pillar of
fire by night, to give them light in the way in which they should go.
<span class="bibleverse">13</span> “You also came down on Mount Sinai,
and spoke with them from heaven, and gave them right ordinances and true
laws, good statutes and commandments, <span class="bibleverse">14</span>
and made known to them your holy Sabbath, and commanded them
commandments, statutes, and a law, by Moses your servant, <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> and gave them bread from the sky for their
hunger, and brought water out of the rock for them for their thirst, and
commanded them that they should go in to possess the land which you had
sworn to give them. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> “But they and our
fathers behaved proudly, hardened their neck, didn’t listen to your
commandments, <span class="bibleverse">17</span> and refused to obey.
They weren’t mindful of your wonders that you did among them, but
hardened their neck, and in their rebellion appointed a captain to
return to their bondage. But you are a God ready to pardon, gracious and
merciful, slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness, and didn’t
forsake them. <span class="bibleverse">18</span> Yes, when they had made
themselves a molded calf, and said, ‘This is your God who brought you up
out of Egypt,’ and had committed awful blasphemies, <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> yet you in your manifold mercies didn’t
forsake them in the wilderness. The pillar of cloud didn’t depart from
over them by day, to lead them in the way; neither did the pillar of
fire by night, to show them light, and the way in which they should go.
<span class="bibleverse">20</span> You gave also your good Spirit to
instruct them, and didn’t withhold your manna from their mouth, and gave
them water for their thirst. <span class="bibleverse">21</span> “Yes,
forty years you sustained them in the wilderness. They lacked nothing.
Their clothes didn’t grow old, and their feet didn’t swell. <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> Moreover you gave them kingdoms and
peoples, which you allotted according to their portions. So they
possessed the land of Sihon, even the land of the king of Heshbon, and
the land of Og king of Bashan. <span class="bibleverse">23</span> You
also multiplied their children as the stars of the sky, and brought them
into the land concerning which you said to their fathers that they
should go in to possess it. <span class="bibleverse">24</span> “So the
children went in and possessed the land; and you subdued before them the
inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gave them into their hands,
with their kings and the peoples of the land, that they might do with
them as they pleased. <span class="bibleverse">25</span> They took
fortified cities and a rich land, and possessed houses full of all good
things, cisterns dug out, vineyards, olive groves, and fruit trees in
abundance. So they ate, were filled, became fat, and delighted
themselves in your great goodness.</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">26</span> “Nevertheless they were
disobedient and rebelled against you, cast your law behind their back,
killed your prophets that testified against them to turn them again to
you, and they committed awful blasphemies. <span
class="bibleverse">27</span> Therefore you delivered them into the hand
of their adversaries, who distressed them. In the time of their trouble,
when they cried to you, you heard from heaven; and according to your
manifold mercies you gave them saviors who saved them out of the hands
of their adversaries. <span class="bibleverse">28</span> But after they
had rest, they did evil again before you; therefore you left them in the
hands of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over them; yet
when they returned and cried to you, you heard from heaven; and many
times you delivered them according to your mercies, <span
class="bibleverse">29</span> and testified against them, that you might
bring them again to your law. Yet they were arrogant, and didn’t listen
to your commandments, but sinned against your ordinances (which if a man
does, he shall live in them), turned their backs, stiffened their neck,
and would not hear. <span class="bibleverse">30</span> Yet many years
you put up with them, and testified against them by your Spirit through
your prophets. Yet they would not listen. Therefore you gave them into
the hand of the peoples of the lands. <span class="bibleverse">31</span>
“Nevertheless in your manifold mercies you didn’t make a full end of
them, nor forsake them; for you are a gracious and merciful God.</p>

wickedly. <span class="bibleverse">34</span> Also our kings, our

listened to your commandments and your testimonies with which you
testified against them. <span class="bibleverse">35</span> For they have
not served you in their kingdom, and in your great goodness that you
gave them, and in the large and rich land which you gave before them.
They didn’t turn from their wicked works. <span

lived in his possession in their cities—Israel, the priests, the
Levites, the temple servants, and the children of Solomon’s servants.
<span class="bibleverse">4</span> Some of the children of Judah and of
the children of Benjamin lived in Jerusalem. Of the children of Judah:
Athaiah the son of Uzziah, the son of Zechariah, the son of Amariah, the

Kolaiah, the son of Maaseiah, the son of Ithiel, the son of Jeshaiah.
<span class="bibleverse">8</span> After him Gabbai and Sallai, nine

oversight of the outward business of God’s house; <span

Zabdi, the son of Asaph, who was the chief to begin the thanksgiving in
prayer, and Bakbukiah, the second among his brothers; and Abda the son
of Shammua, the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun. <span

hundred eighty-four. <span class="bibleverse">19</span> Moreover the
gatekeepers, Akkub, Talmon, and their brothers, who kept watch at the
gates, were one hundred seventy-two. <span class="bibleverse">20</span>
The residue of Israel, of the priests, and the Levites were in all the
cities of Judah, everyone in his inheritance. <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> But the temple servants lived in Ophel; and
Ziha and Gishpa were over the temple servants. <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> The overseer also of the Levites at
Jerusalem was Uzzi the son of Bani, the son of Hashabiah, the son of
Mattaniah, the son of Mica, of the sons of Asaph, the singers, was over
the business of God’s house. <span class="bibleverse">23</span> For
there was a commandment from the king concerning them, and a settled
provision for the singers, as every day required. <span

fathers’ households; also the priests, in the reign of Darius the
Persian. <span class="bibleverse">23</span> The sons of Levi, heads of
fathers’ households, were written in the book of the chronicles, even
until the days of Johanan the son of Eliashib. <span
class="bibleverse">24</span> The chiefs of the Levites: Hashabiah,
Sherebiah, and Jeshua the son of Kadmiel, with their brothers close to
them, to praise and give thanks according to the commandment of David
the man of God, section next to section. <span
class="bibleverse">25</span> Mattaniah, Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam,

Nehemiah the governor, and of Ezra the priest and scribe.</p>
<h2 id="inauguration-of-the-city-wall">Inauguration of the city
wall</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">27</span> At the dedication of the wall of
Jerusalem, they sought the Levites out of all their places, to bring
them to Jerusalem to keep the dedication with gladness, both with giving
thanks and with singing, with cymbals, stringed instruments, and with
harps. <span class="bibleverse">28</span> The sons of the singers
gathered themselves together, both out of the plain around Jerusalem and
from the villages of the Netophathites; <span
class="bibleverse">29</span> also from Beth Gilgal and out of the fields
of Geba and Azmaveth, for the singers had built themselves villages
around Jerusalem. <span class="bibleverse">30</span> The priests and the
Levites purified themselves; and they purified the people, the gates,
and the wall. <span class="bibleverse">31</span> Then I brought the
princes of Judah up on the wall, and appointed two great companies who
gave thanks and went in procession. One went on the right hand on the
wall toward the dung gate; <span class="bibleverse">32</span> and after
them went Hoshaiah, with half of the princes of Judah, <span
class="bibleverse">33</span> and Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam, <span
class="bibleverse">34</span> Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, Jeremiah, <span
class="bibleverse">35</span> and some of the priests’ sons with
trumpets: Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of
Mattaniah, the son of Micaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph;
<span class="bibleverse">36</span> and his brothers, Shemaiah, Azarel,
Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah, and Hanani, with the musical
instruments of David the man of God; and Ezra the scribe was before
them. <span class="bibleverse">37</span> By the spring gate, and
straight before them, they went up by the stairs of David’s city, at the
ascent of the wall, above David’s house, even to the water gate
eastward. <span class="bibleverse">38</span> The other company of those
who gave thanks went to meet them, and I after them, with the half of
the people on the wall above the tower of the furnaces, even to the wide
wall, <span class="bibleverse">39</span> and above the gate of Ephraim,
and by the old gate, and by the fish gate, the tower of Hananel, and the
tower of Hammeah, even to the sheep gate; and they stood still in the
gate of the guard. <span class="bibleverse">40</span> So the two
companies of those who gave thanks in God’s house stood, and I and the
half of the rulers with me; <span class="bibleverse">41</span> and the
priests, Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and
Hananiah, with trumpets; <span class="bibleverse">42</span> and
Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malchijah, Elam, and Ezer.
The singers sang loud, with Jezrahiah their overseer. <span
class="bibleverse">43</span> They offered great sacrifices that day, and
rejoiced, for God had made them rejoice with great joy; and the women
and the children also rejoiced, so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard
even far away.</p>
<h2

of officials to supervise the income of the priests and Levites</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">44</span> On that day, men were appointed
over the rooms for the treasures, for the wave offerings, for the first
fruits, and for the tithes, to gather into them according to the fields
of the cities the portions appointed by the law for the priests and
Levites; for Judah rejoiced for the priests and for the Levites who
served. <span class="bibleverse">45</span> They performed the duty of
their God and the duty of the purification, and so did the singers and
the gatekeepers, according to the commandment of David and of Solomon
his son. <span class="bibleverse">46</span> For in the days of David and
Asaph of old there was a chief of the singers, and songs of praise and
thanksgiving to God. <span class="bibleverse">47</span> All Israel in
the days of Zerubbabel and in the days of Nehemiah gave the portions of
the singers and the gatekeepers, as every day required; and they set
apart that which was for the Levites; and the Levites set apart that
which was for the sons of Aaron.</p>
<h1 id="section-12">13</h1>
<h2
id="elimination-of-pagan-components-especially-ammonites-and-moabites-from-the-community">Elimination
of pagan components (especially Ammonites and Moabites) from the
community</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> On that day they read in the book
of Moses in the hearing of the people; and it was found written in it
that an Ammonite and a Moabite should not enter into the assembly of God
forever, <span class="bibleverse">2</span> because they didn’t meet the
children of Israel with bread and with water, but hired Balaam against
them to curse them; however, our God turned the curse into a blessing.
<span class="bibleverse">3</span> It came to pass, when they had heard
the law, that they separated all the mixed multitude from Israel.</p>
<h2 id="removal-of-tobijas-cell-in-the-temple">Removal of Tobija's cell
in the temple</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">4</span> Now before this, Eliashib the
priest, who was appointed over the rooms of the house of our God, being
allied to Tobiah, <span class="bibleverse">5</span> had prepared for him
a great room, where before they laid the meal offerings, the
frankincense, the vessels, and the tithes of the grain, the new wine,
and the oil, which were given by commandment to the Levites, the
singers, and the gatekeepers; and the wave offerings for the priests.
<span class="bibleverse">6</span> But in all this, I was not at
Jerusalem; for in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I
went to the king; and after some days I asked leave of the king, <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> and I came to Jerusalem, and understood the
evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah, in preparing him a room in the
courts of God’s house. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> It grieved me
severely. Therefore I threw all Tobiah’s household stuff out of the
room. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> Then I commanded, and they
cleansed the rooms. I brought into them the vessels of God’s house, with
the meal offerings and the frankincense again.</p>
<h2
id="ensuring-the-proper-delivery-of-tributes-to-the-levites">Ensuring
the proper delivery of tributes to the Levites</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">10</span> I perceived that the portions of
the Levites had not been given them, so that the Levites and the
singers, who did the work, had each fled to his field. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> Then I contended with the rulers, and said,
“Why is God’s house forsaken?” I gathered them together, and set them in
their place. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> Then all Judah brought
the tithe of the grain, the new wine, and the oil to the treasuries.
<span class="bibleverse">13</span> I made treasurers over the
treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the
Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son
of Mattaniah; for they were counted faithful, and their business was to
distribute to their brothers. <span class="bibleverse">14</span>
Remember me, my God, concerning this, and don’t wipe out my good deeds
that I have done for the house of my God, and for its observances.</p>
<h2
id="eliminate-the-desecration-of-the-sabbath-by-businessmen-and-merchants">Eliminate
the desecration of the Sabbath by businessmen and merchants</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">15</span> In those days I saw some men
treading wine presses on the Sabbath in Judah, bringing in sheaves, and
loading donkeys with wine, grapes, figs, and all kinds of burdens which
they brought into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day; and I testified against
them in the day in which they sold food. <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> Some men of Tyre also lived there, who
brought in fish and all kinds of wares, and sold on the Sabbath to the
children of Judah, and in Jerusalem. <span class="bibleverse">17</span>
Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said to them, “What evil
thing is this that you do, and profane the Sabbath day? <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> Didn’t your fathers do this, and didn’t our
God bring all this evil on us and on this city? Yet you bring more wrath
on Israel by profaning the Sabbath.” <span class="bibleverse">19</span>
It came to pass that when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before
the Sabbath, I commanded that the doors should be shut, and commanded
that they should not be opened until after the Sabbath. I set some of my
servants over the gates, so that no burden should be brought in on the
Sabbath day. <span class="bibleverse">20</span> So the merchants and
sellers of all kinds of wares camped outside of Jerusalem once or twice.
<span class="bibleverse">21</span> Then I testified against them, and
said to them, “Why do you stay around the wall? If you do so again, I
will lay hands on you.” From that time on, they didn’t come on the
Sabbath. <span class="bibleverse">22</span> I commanded the Levites that
they should purify themselves, and that they should come and keep the
gates, to sanctify the Sabbath day. Remember me for this also, my God,
and spare me according to the greatness of your loving kindness.</p>
<h2
id="measures-against-mixed-marriages-rejection-of-the-son-of-a-high-priest">Measures
against mixed marriages; Rejection of the son of a high priest</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">23</span> In those days I also saw the Jews
who had married women of Ashdod, of Ammon, and of Moab; <span
class="bibleverse">24</span> and their children spoke half in the speech
of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews’ language, but according to
the language of each people. <span class="bibleverse">25</span> I
contended with them, cursed them, struck certain of them, plucked off
their hair, and made them swear by God, “You shall not give your
daughters to their sons, nor take their daughters for your sons, or for
yourselves. <span class="bibleverse">26</span> Didn’t Solomon king of
Israel sin by these things? Yet among many nations there was no king
like him, and he was loved by his God, and God made him king over all
Israel. Nevertheless foreign women caused even him to sin. <span
class="bibleverse">27</span> Shall we then listen to you to do all this
great evil, to trespass against our God in marrying foreign women?”
<span class="bibleverse">28</span> One of the sons of Joiada, the son of
Eliashib the high priest, was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite;
therefore I chased him from me. <span class="bibleverse">29</span>
Remember them, my God, because they have defiled the priesthood and the
covenant of the priesthood and of the Levites.</p>
<h2 id="end-of-memo">End of memo</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">30</span> Thus I cleansed them from all
foreigners and appointed duties for the priests and for the Levites,
everyone in his work; <span class="bibleverse">31</span> and for the
wood offering, at appointed times, and for the first fruits. Remember
me, my God, for good.</p>
