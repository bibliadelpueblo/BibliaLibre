<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> The beginning of the Good News of
Jesus Christ, the Son of God.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">2</span> As it is written in the prophets,
“Behold,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> I send my messenger before your
face, who will prepare your way before you:<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>
<span class="bibleverse">3</span> the voice of one crying in the
wilderness, ‘Make ready the way of the Lord! Make his paths
straight!’”<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">4</span> John came baptizing<a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> in
the wilderness and preaching the baptism of repentance for forgiveness
of sins. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> All the country of Judea and
all those of Jerusalem went out to him. They were baptized by him in the
Jordan river, confessing their sins. <span class="bibleverse">6</span>
John was clothed with camel’s hair and a leather belt around his waist.
He ate locusts and wild honey. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> He
preached, saying, “After me comes he who is mightier than I, the thong
of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and loosen. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> I baptized you in<a href="#fn5"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>
water, but he will baptize you in the Holy Spirit.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">9</span> In those days, Jesus came from
Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> Immediately coming up from the water, he
saw the heavens parting and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.
<span class="bibleverse">11</span> A voice came out of the sky, “You are
my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">12</span> Immediately the Spirit drove him
out into the wilderness. <span class="bibleverse">13</span> He was there
in the wilderness forty days, tempted by Satan. He was with the wild
animals; and the angels were serving him.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">14</span> Now after John was taken into
custody, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the Good News of God’s
Kingdom, <span class="bibleverse">15</span> and saying, “The time is
fulfilled, and God’s Kingdom is at hand! Repent, and believe in the Good
News.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">16</span> Passing along by the sea of
Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew, the brother of Simon, casting a net
into the sea, for they were fishermen. <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> Jesus said to them, “Come after me, and I
will make you into fishers for men.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">18</span> Immediately they left their nets,
and followed him.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">19</span> Going on a little further from
there, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who were
also in the boat mending the nets. <span class="bibleverse">20</span>
Immediately he called them, and they left their father, Zebedee, in the
boat with the hired servants, and went after him.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">21</span> They went into Capernaum, and
immediately on the Sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught.
<span class="bibleverse">22</span> They were astonished at his teaching,
for he taught them as having authority, and not as the scribes. <span
class="bibleverse">23</span> Immediately there was in their synagogue a
man with an unclean spirit, and he cried out, <span
class="bibleverse">24</span> saying, “Ha! What do we have to do with
you, Jesus, you Nazarene? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you
are: the Holy One of God!”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">25</span> Jesus rebuked him, saying, “Be
quiet, and come out of him!”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">26</span> The unclean spirit, convulsing him
and crying with a loud voice, came out of him. <span
class="bibleverse">27</span> They were all amazed, so that they
questioned among themselves, saying, “What is this? A new teaching? For
with authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him!”
<span class="bibleverse">28</span> The report of him went out
immediately everywhere into all the region of Galilee and its
surrounding area.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">29</span> Immediately, when they had come
out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with
James and John. <span class="bibleverse">30</span> Now Simon’s wife’s
mother lay sick with a fever, and immediately they told him about her.
<span class="bibleverse">31</span> He came and took her by the hand and
raised her up. The fever left her immediately,<a href="#fn6"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> and
she served them.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">32</span> At evening, when the sun had set,
they brought to him all who were sick and those who were possessed by
demons. <span class="bibleverse">33</span> All the city was gathered
together at the door. <span class="bibleverse">34</span> He healed many
who were sick with various diseases and cast out many demons. He didn’t
allow the demons to speak, because they knew him.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">35</span> Early in the morning, while it was
still dark, he rose up and went out, and departed into a deserted place,
and prayed there. <span class="bibleverse">36</span> Simon and those who
were with him searched for him. <span class="bibleverse">37</span> They
found him and told him, “Everyone is looking for you.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">38</span> He said to them, “Let’s go
elsewhere into the next towns, that I may preach there also, because I
came out for this reason.” <span class="bibleverse">39</span> He went
into their synagogues throughout all Galilee, preaching and casting out
demons.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">40</span> A leper came to him, begging him,
kneeling down to him, and saying to him, “If you want to, you can make
me clean.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">41</span> Being moved with compassion, he
stretched out his hand, and touched him, and said to him, “I want to. Be
made clean.” <span class="bibleverse">42</span> When he had said this,
immediately the leprosy departed from him and he was made clean. <span
class="bibleverse">43</span> He strictly warned him and immediately sent
him out, <span class="bibleverse">44</span> and said to him, “See that
you say nothing to anybody, but go show yourself to the priest and offer
for your cleansing the things which Moses commanded, for a testimony to
them.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">45</span> But he went out, and began to
proclaim it much, and to spread about the matter, so that Jesus could no
more openly enter into a city, but was outside in desert places. People
came to him from everywhere.</p>
<h1 id="section-1">2</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> When he entered again into
Capernaum after some days, it was heard that he was at home. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> Immediately many were gathered together, so
that there was no more room, not even around the door; and he spoke the
word to them. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> Four people came,
carrying a paralytic to him. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> When they
could not come near to him for the crowd, they removed the roof where he
was. When they had broken it up, they let down the mat that the
paralytic was lying on. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> Jesus, seeing
their faith, said to the paralytic, “Son, your sins are forgiven
you.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">6</span> But there were some of the scribes
sitting there and reasoning in their hearts, <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> “Why does this man speak blasphemies like
that? Who can forgive sins but God alone?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">8</span> Immediately Jesus, perceiving in
his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, said to them, “Why
do you reason these things in your hearts? <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> Which is easier, to tell the paralytic,
‘Your sins are forgiven;’ or to say, ‘Arise, and take up your bed, and
walk?’ <span class="bibleverse">10</span> But that you may know that the
Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins”—he said to the
paralytic— <span class="bibleverse">11</span> “I tell you, arise, take
up your mat, and go to your house.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">12</span> He arose, and immediately took up
the mat and went out in front of them all, so that they were all amazed
and glorified God, saying, “We never saw anything like this!”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">13</span> He went out again by the seaside.
All the multitude came to him, and he taught them. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> As he passed by, he saw Levi the son of
Alphaeus sitting at the tax office. He said to him, “Follow me.” And he
arose and followed him.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">15</span> He was reclining at the table in
his house, and many tax collectors and sinners sat down with Jesus and
his disciples, for there were many, and they followed him. <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> The scribes and the Pharisees, when they
saw that he was eating with the sinners and tax collectors, said to his
disciples, “Why is it that he eats and drinks with tax collectors and
sinners?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">17</span> When Jesus heard it, he said to
them, “Those who are healthy have no need for a physician, but those who
are sick. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to
repentance.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">18</span> John’s disciples and the Pharisees
were fasting, and they came and asked him, “Why do John’s disciples and
the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples don’t fast?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">19</span> Jesus said to them, “Can the
groomsmen fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have
the bridegroom with them, they can’t fast. <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> But the days will come when the bridegroom
will be taken away from them, and then they will fast in that day. <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> No one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an
old garment, or else the patch shrinks and the new tears away from the
old, and a worse hole is made. <span class="bibleverse">22</span> No one
puts new wine into old wineskins; or else the new wine will burst the
skins, and the wine pours out, and the skins will be destroyed; but they
put new wine into fresh wineskins.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">23</span> He was going on the Sabbath day
through the grain fields; and his disciples began, as they went, to
pluck the ears of grain. <span class="bibleverse">24</span> The
Pharisees said to him, “Behold, why do they do that which is not lawful
on the Sabbath day?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">25</span> He said to them, “Did you never
read what David did when he had need and was hungry—he, and those who
were with him? <span class="bibleverse">26</span> How he entered into
God’s house at the time of Abiathar the high priest, and ate the show
bread, which is not lawful to eat except for the priests, and gave also
to those who were with him?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">27</span> He said to them, “The Sabbath was
made for man, not man for the Sabbath. <span
class="bibleverse">28</span> Therefore the Son of Man is lord even of
the Sabbath.”</p>
<h1 id="section-2">3</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> He entered again into the
synagogue, and there was a man there whose hand was withered. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> They watched him, whether he would heal him
on the Sabbath day, that they might accuse him. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> He said to the man whose hand was withered,
“Stand up.” <span class="bibleverse">4</span> He said to them, “Is it
lawful on the Sabbath day to do good or to do harm? To save a life or to
kill?” But they were silent. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> When he
had looked around at them with anger, being grieved at the hardening of
their hearts, he said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” He stretched
it out, and his hand was restored as healthy as the other. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> The Pharisees went out, and immediately
conspired with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy
him.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">7</span> Jesus withdrew to the sea with his
disciples; and a great multitude followed him from Galilee, from Judea,
<span class="bibleverse">8</span> from Jerusalem, from Idumaea, beyond
the Jordan, and those from around Tyre and Sidon. A great multitude,
hearing what great things he did, came to him. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> He spoke to his disciples that a little boat
should stay near him because of the crowd, so that they wouldn’t press
on him. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> For he had healed many, so
that as many as had diseases pressed on him that they might touch him.
<span class="bibleverse">11</span> The unclean spirits, whenever they
saw him, fell down before him and cried, “You are the Son of God!” <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> He sternly warned them that they should not
make him known.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">13</span> He went up into the mountain and
called to himself those whom he wanted, and they went to him. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> He appointed twelve, that they might be
with him, and that he might send them out to preach <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> and to have authority to heal sicknesses
and to cast out demons: <span class="bibleverse">16</span> Simon (to
whom he gave the name Peter); <span class="bibleverse">17</span> James
the son of Zebedee; and John, the brother of James, (whom he called
Boanerges, which means, Sons of Thunder); <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> Andrew; Philip; Bartholomew; Matthew;
Thomas; James, the son of Alphaeus; Thaddaeus; Simon the Zealot; <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed
him.</p>
<p>Then he came into a house. <span class="bibleverse">20</span> The
multitude came together again, so that they could not so much as eat
bread. <span class="bibleverse">21</span> When his friends heard it,
they went out to seize him; for they said, “He is insane.” <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> The scribes who came down from Jerusalem
said, “He has Beelzebul,” and, “By the prince of the demons he casts out
the demons.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">23</span> He summoned them and said to them
in parables, “How can Satan cast out Satan? <span
class="bibleverse">24</span> If a kingdom is divided against itself,
that kingdom cannot stand. <span class="bibleverse">25</span> If a house
is divided against itself, that house cannot stand. <span
class="bibleverse">26</span> If Satan has risen up against himself, and
is divided, he can’t stand, but has an end. <span
class="bibleverse">27</span> But no one can enter into the house of the
strong man to plunder unless he first binds the strong man; then he will
plunder his house.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">28</span> “Most certainly I tell you, all
sins of the descendants of man will be forgiven, including their
blasphemies with which they may blaspheme; <span
class="bibleverse">29</span> but whoever may blaspheme against the Holy
Spirit never has forgiveness, but is subject to eternal condemnation.”<a
href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> <span class="bibleverse">30</span>
—because they said, “He has an unclean spirit.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">31</span> His mother and his brothers came,
and standing outside, they sent to him, calling him. <span
class="bibleverse">32</span> A multitude was sitting around him, and
they told him, “Behold, your mother, your brothers, and your sisters<a
href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> are outside looking for you.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">33</span> He answered them, “Who are my
mother and my brothers?” <span class="bibleverse">34</span> Looking
around at those who sat around him, he said, “Behold, my mother and my
brothers! <span class="bibleverse">35</span> For whoever does the will
of God is my brother, my sister, and mother.”</p>
<h1 id="section-3">4</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Again he began to teach by the
seaside. A great multitude was gathered to him, so that he entered into
a boat in the sea and sat down. All the multitude were on the land by
the sea. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> He taught them many things in
parables, and told them in his teaching, <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> “Listen! Behold, the farmer went out to sow.
<span class="bibleverse">4</span> As he sowed, some seed fell by the
road, and the birds<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> came and devoured it. <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> Others fell on the rocky ground, where it
had little soil, and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth
of soil. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> When the sun had risen, it
was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> Others fell among the thorns, and the thorns
grew up and choked it, and it yielded no fruit. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> Others fell into the good ground and yielded
fruit, growing up and increasing. Some produced thirty times, some sixty
times, and some one hundred times as much.” <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> He said, “Whoever has ears to hear, let him
hear.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">10</span> When he was alone, those who were
around him with the twelve asked him about the parables. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> He said to them, “To you is given the
mystery of God’s Kingdom, but to those who are outside, all things are
done in parables, <span class="bibleverse">12</span> that ‘seeing they
may see and not perceive, and hearing they may hear and not understand,
lest perhaps they should turn again, and their sins should be forgiven
them.’”<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">13</span> He said to them, “Don’t you
understand this parable? How will you understand all of the parables?
<span class="bibleverse">14</span> The farmer sows the word. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> The ones by the road are the ones where the
word is sown; and when they have heard, immediately Satan comes and
takes away the word which has been sown in them. <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> These in the same way are those who are
sown on the rocky places, who, when they have heard the word,
immediately receive it with joy. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> They
have no root in themselves, but are short-lived. When oppression or
persecution arises because of the word, immediately they stumble. <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> Others are those who are sown among the
thorns. These are those who have heard the word, <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> and the cares of this age, and the
deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in choke
the word, and it becomes unfruitful. <span class="bibleverse">20</span>
Those which were sown on the good ground are those who hear the word,
accept it, and bear fruit, some thirty times, some sixty times, and some
one hundred times.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">21</span> He said to them, “Is a lamp
brought to be put under a basket <a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> or under a bed? Isn’t
it put on a stand? <span class="bibleverse">22</span> For there is
nothing hidden except that it should be made known, neither was anything
made secret but that it should come to light. <span
class="bibleverse">23</span> If any man has ears to hear, let him
hear.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">24</span> He said to them, “Take heed what
you hear. With whatever measure you measure, it will be measured to you;
and more will be given to you who hear. <span
class="bibleverse">25</span> For whoever has, to him more will be given;
and he who doesn’t have, even that which he has will be taken away from
him.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">26</span> He said, “God’s Kingdom is as if a
man should cast seed on the earth, <span class="bibleverse">27</span>
and should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should spring up
and grow, though he doesn’t know how. <span class="bibleverse">28</span>
For the earth bears fruit by itself: first the blade, then the ear, then
the full grain in the ear. <span class="bibleverse">29</span> But when
the fruit is ripe, immediately he puts in the sickle, because the
harvest has come.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">30</span> He said, “How will we liken God’s
Kingdom? Or with what parable will we illustrate it? <span
class="bibleverse">31</span> It’s like a grain of mustard seed, which,
when it is sown in the earth, though it is less than all the seeds that
are on the earth, <span class="bibleverse">32</span> yet when it is
sown, grows up and becomes greater than all the herbs, and puts out
great branches, so that the birds of the sky can lodge under its
shadow.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">33</span> With many such parables he spoke
the word to them, as they were able to hear it. <span
class="bibleverse">34</span> Without a parable he didn’t speak to them;
but privately to his own disciples he explained everything.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">35</span> On that day, when evening had
come, he said to them, “Let’s go over to the other side.” <span
class="bibleverse">36</span> Leaving the multitude, they took him with
them, even as he was, in the boat. Other small boats were also with him.
<span class="bibleverse">37</span> A big wind storm arose, and the waves
beat into the boat, so much that the boat was already filled. <span
class="bibleverse">38</span> He himself was in the stern, asleep on the
cushion; and they woke him up and asked him, “Teacher, don’t you care
that we are dying?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">39</span> He awoke and rebuked the wind, and
said to the sea, “Peace! Be still!” The wind ceased and there was a
great calm. <span class="bibleverse">40</span> He said to them, “Why are
you so afraid? How is it that you have no faith?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">41</span> They were greatly afraid and said
to one another, “Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey
him?”</p>
<h1 id="section-4">5</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> They came to the other side of the
sea, into the country of the Gadarenes. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> When he had come out of the boat,
immediately a man with an unclean spirit met him out of the tombs. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> He lived in the tombs. Nobody could bind him
any more, not even with chains, <span class="bibleverse">4</span>
because he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains
had been torn apart by him, and the fetters broken in pieces. Nobody had
the strength to tame him. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> Always,
night and day, in the tombs and in the mountains, he was crying out, and
cutting himself with stones. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> When he
saw Jesus from afar, he ran and bowed down to him, <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> and crying out with a loud voice, he said,
“What have I to do with you, Jesus, you Son of the Most High God? I
adjure you by God, don’t torment me.” <span class="bibleverse">8</span>
For he said to him, “Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">9</span> He asked him, “What is your
name?”</p>
<p>He said to him, “My name is Legion, for we are many.” <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> He begged him much that he would not send
them away out of the country. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> Now on
the mountainside there was a great herd of pigs feeding. <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> All the demons begged him, saying, “Send us
into the pigs, that we may enter into them.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">13</span> At once Jesus gave them
permission. The unclean spirits came out and entered into the pigs. The
herd of about two thousand rushed down the steep bank into the sea, and
they were drowned in the sea. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> Those
who fed the pigs fled, and told it in the city and in the country.</p>
<p>The people came to see what it was that had happened. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> They came to Jesus, and saw him who had
been possessed by demons sitting, clothed, and in his right mind, even
him who had the legion; and they were afraid. <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> Those who saw it declared to them what
happened to him who was possessed by demons, and about the pigs. <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> They began to beg him to depart from their
region.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">18</span> As he was entering into the boat,
he who had been possessed by demons begged him that he might be with
him. <span class="bibleverse">19</span> He didn’t allow him, but said to
him, “Go to your house, to your friends, and tell them what great things
the Lord has done for you and how he had mercy on you.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">20</span> He went his way, and began to
proclaim in Decapolis how Jesus had done great things for him, and
everyone marveled.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">21</span> When Jesus had crossed back over
in the boat to the other side, a great multitude was gathered to him;
and he was by the sea. <span class="bibleverse">22</span> Behold, one of
the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name, came; and seeing him, he
fell at his feet <span class="bibleverse">23</span> and begged him much,
saying, “My little daughter is at the point of death. Please come and
lay your hands on her, that she may be made healthy, and live.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">24</span> He went with him, and a great
multitude followed him, and they pressed upon him on all sides. <span
class="bibleverse">25</span> A certain woman who had a discharge of
blood for twelve years, <span class="bibleverse">26</span> and had
suffered many things by many physicians, and had spent all that she had,
and was no better, but rather grew worse, <span
class="bibleverse">27</span> having heard the things concerning Jesus,
came up behind him in the crowd and touched his clothes. <span
class="bibleverse">28</span> For she said, “If I just touch his clothes,
I will be made well.” <span class="bibleverse">29</span> Immediately the
flow of her blood was dried up, and she felt in her body that she was
healed of her affliction.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">30</span> Immediately Jesus, perceiving in
himself that the power had gone out from him, turned around in the crowd
and asked, “Who touched my clothes?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">31</span> His disciples said to him, “You
see the multitude pressing against you, and you say, ‘Who touched
me?’”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">32</span> He looked around to see her who
had done this thing. <span class="bibleverse">33</span> But the woman,
fearing and trembling, knowing what had been done to her, came and fell
down before him, and told him all the truth.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">34</span> He said to her, “Daughter, your
faith has made you well. Go in peace, and be cured of your disease.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">35</span> While he was still speaking,
people came from the synagogue ruler’s house, saying, “Your daughter is
dead. Why bother the Teacher any more?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">36</span> But Jesus, when he heard the
message spoken, immediately said to the ruler of the synagogue, “Don’t
be afraid, only believe.” <span class="bibleverse">37</span> He allowed
no one to follow him except Peter, James, and John the brother of James.
<span class="bibleverse">38</span> He came to the synagogue ruler’s
house, and he saw an uproar, weeping, and great wailing. <span
class="bibleverse">39</span> When he had entered in, he said to them,
“Why do you make an uproar and weep? The child is not dead, but is
asleep.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">40</span> They ridiculed him. But he, having
put them all out, took the father of the child, her mother, and those
who were with him, and went in where the child was lying. <span
class="bibleverse">41</span> Taking the child by the hand, he said to
her, “Talitha cumi!” which means, being interpreted, “Girl, I tell you,
get up!” <span class="bibleverse">42</span> Immediately the girl rose up
and walked, for she was twelve years old. They were amazed with great
amazement. <span class="bibleverse">43</span> He strictly ordered them
that no one should know this, and commanded that something should be
given to her to eat.</p>
<h1 id="section-5">6</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> He went out from there. He came
into his own country, and his disciples followed him. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> When the Sabbath had come, he began to teach
in the synagogue, and many hearing him were astonished, saying, “Where
did this man get these things?” and, “What is the wisdom that is given
to this man, that such mighty works come about by his hands? <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> Isn’t this the carpenter, the son of Mary
and brother of James, Joses, Judah, and Simon? Aren’t his sisters here
with us?” So they were offended at him.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">4</span> Jesus said to them, “A prophet is
not without honor, except in his own country, and among his own
relatives, and in his own house.” <span class="bibleverse">5</span> He
could do no mighty work there, except that he laid his hands on a few
sick people and healed them. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> He
marveled because of their unbelief.</p>
<p>He went around the villages teaching. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> He called to himself the twelve, and began
to send them out two by two; and he gave them authority over the unclean
spirits. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> He commanded them that they
should take nothing for their journey, except a staff only: no bread, no
wallet, no money in their purse, <span class="bibleverse">9</span> but
to wear sandals, and not put on two tunics. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> He said to them, “Wherever you enter into a
house, stay there until you depart from there. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> Whoever will not receive you nor hear you,
as you depart from there, shake off the dust that is under your feet for
a testimony against them. Assuredly, I tell you, it will be more
tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that
city!”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">12</span> They went out and preached that
people should repent. <span class="bibleverse">13</span> They cast out
many demons, and anointed many with oil who were sick and healed them.
<span class="bibleverse">14</span> King Herod heard this, for his name
had become known, and he said, “John the Baptizer has risen from the
dead, and therefore these powers are at work in him.” <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> But others said, “He is Elijah.” Others
said, “He is a prophet, or like one of the prophets.” <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> But Herod, when he heard this, said, “This
is John, whom I beheaded. He has risen from the dead.” <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> For Herod himself had sent out and arrested
John and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother
Philip’s wife, for he had married her. <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> For John had said to Herod, “It is not
lawful for you to have your brother’s wife.” <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> Herodias set herself against him and
desired to kill him, but she couldn’t, <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> for Herod feared John, knowing that he was
a righteous and holy man, and kept him safe. When he heard him, he did
many things, and he heard him gladly.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">21</span> Then a convenient day came when
Herod on his birthday made a supper for his nobles, the high officers,
and the chief men of Galilee. <span class="bibleverse">22</span> When
the daughter of Herodias herself came in and danced, she pleased Herod
and those sitting with him. The king said to the young lady, “Ask me
whatever you want, and I will give it to you.” <span
class="bibleverse">23</span> He swore to her, “Whatever you ask of me, I
will give you, up to half of my kingdom.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">24</span> She went out and said to her
mother, “What shall I ask?”</p>
<p>She said, “The head of John the Baptizer.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">25</span> She came in immediately with haste
to the king and requested, “I want you to give me right now the head of
John the Baptizer on a platter.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">26</span> The king was exceedingly sorry,
but for the sake of his oaths and of his dinner guests, he didn’t wish
to refuse her. <span class="bibleverse">27</span> Immediately the king
sent out a soldier of his guard and commanded to bring John’s head; and
he went and beheaded him in the prison, <span
class="bibleverse">28</span> and brought his head on a platter, and gave
it to the young lady; and the young lady gave it to her mother.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">29</span> When his disciples heard this,
they came and took up his corpse and laid it in a tomb.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">30</span> The apostles gathered themselves
together to Jesus, and they told him all things, whatever they had done,
and whatever they had taught. <span class="bibleverse">31</span> He said
to them, “Come away into a deserted place, and rest awhile.” For there
were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat.
<span class="bibleverse">32</span> They went away in the boat to a
deserted place by themselves. <span class="bibleverse">33</span> They<a
href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> saw them going, and many recognized
him and ran there on foot from all the cities. They arrived before them
and came together to him. <span class="bibleverse">34</span> Jesus came
out, saw a great multitude, and he had compassion on them because they
were like sheep without a shepherd; and he began to teach them many
things. <span class="bibleverse">35</span> When it was late in the day,
his disciples came to him and said, “This place is deserted, and it is
late in the day. <span class="bibleverse">36</span> Send them away, that
they may go into the surrounding country and villages and buy themselves
bread, for they have nothing to eat.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">37</span> But he answered them, “You give
them something to eat.”</p>
<p>They asked him, “Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii<a
href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> worth of bread and give them
something to eat?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">38</span> He said to them, “How many loaves
do you have? Go see.”</p>
<p>When they knew, they said, “Five, and two fish.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">39</span> He commanded them that everyone
should sit down in groups on the green grass. <span
class="bibleverse">40</span> They sat down in ranks, by hundreds and by
fifties. <span class="bibleverse">41</span> He took the five loaves and
the two fish; and looking up to heaven, he blessed and broke the loaves,
and he gave to his disciples to set before them, and he divided the two
fish among them all. <span class="bibleverse">42</span> They all ate and
were filled. <span class="bibleverse">43</span> They took up twelve
baskets full of broken pieces and also of the fish. <span
class="bibleverse">44</span> Those who ate the loaves were<a
href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> five thousand men.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">45</span> Immediately he made his disciples
get into the boat and go ahead to the other side, to Bethsaida, while he
himself sent the multitude away. <span class="bibleverse">46</span>
After he had taken leave of them, he went up the mountain to pray.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">47</span> When evening had come, the boat
was in the middle of the sea, and he was alone on the land. <span
class="bibleverse">48</span> Seeing them distressed in rowing, for the
wind was contrary to them, about the fourth watch of the night he came
to them, walking on the sea; <a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> and he would have
passed by them, <span class="bibleverse">49</span> but they, when they
saw him walking on the sea, supposed that it was a ghost, and cried out;
<span class="bibleverse">50</span> for they all saw him and were
troubled. But he immediately spoke with them and said to them, “Cheer
up! It is I!<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> Don’t be afraid.” <span
class="bibleverse">51</span> He got into the boat with them; and the
wind ceased, and they were very amazed among themselves, and marveled;
<span class="bibleverse">52</span> for they hadn’t understood about the
loaves, but their hearts were hardened.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">53</span> When they had crossed over, they
came to land at Gennesaret and moored to the shore. <span
class="bibleverse">54</span> When they had come out of the boat,
immediately the people recognized him, <span
class="bibleverse">55</span> and ran around that whole region, and began
to bring those who were sick on their mats to where they heard he was.
<span class="bibleverse">56</span> Wherever he entered—into villages, or
into cities, or into the country—they laid the sick in the marketplaces
and begged him that they might just touch the fringe<a href="#fn17"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a>
of his garment; and as many as touched him were made well.</p>
<h1 id="section-6">7</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Then the Pharisees and some of the
scribes gathered together to him, having come from Jerusalem. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> Now when they saw some of his disciples
eating bread with defiled, that is unwashed, hands, they found fault.
<span class="bibleverse">3</span> (For the Pharisees and all the Jews
don’t eat unless they wash their hands and forearms, holding to the
tradition of the elders. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> They don’t
eat when they come from the marketplace unless they bathe themselves,
and there are many other things which they have received to hold to:
washings of cups, pitchers, bronze vessels, and couches.) <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> The Pharisees and the scribes asked him,
“Why don’t your disciples walk according to the tradition of the elders,
but eat their bread with unwashed hands?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">6</span> He answered them, “Well did Isaiah
prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written, ‘This people honors me
with their lips, but their heart is far from me. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> They worship me in vain, teaching as
doctrines the commandments of men.’<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">8</span> “For you set aside the commandment
of God, and hold tightly to the tradition of men—the washing of pitchers
and cups, and you do many other such things.” <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> He said to them, “Full well do you reject
the commandment of God, that you may keep your tradition. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> For Moses said, ‘Honor your father and your
mother;’<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> and, ‘He who speaks evil of father
or mother, let him be put to death.’<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> But you say, ‘If a man tells his father or
his mother, “Whatever profit you might have received from me is
Corban,”’”<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> that is to say, given to God, <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> “then you no longer allow him to do
anything for his father or his mother, <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> making void the word of God by your
tradition which you have handed down. You do many things like this.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">14</span> He called all the multitude to
himself and said to them, “Hear me, all of you, and understand. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> There is nothing from outside of the man
that going into him can defile him; but the things which proceed out of
the man are those that defile the man. <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> If anyone has ears to hear, let him
hear!”<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">17</span> When he had entered into a house
away from the multitude, his disciples asked him about the parable.
<span class="bibleverse">18</span> He said to them, “Are you also
without understanding? Don’t you perceive that whatever goes into the
man from outside can’t defile him, <span class="bibleverse">19</span>
because it doesn’t go into his heart, but into his stomach, then into
the latrine, making all foods clean?”<a href="#fn23"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a>
<span class="bibleverse">20</span> He said, “That which proceeds out of
the man, that defiles the man. <span class="bibleverse">21</span> For
from within, out of the hearts of men, proceed evil thoughts,
adulteries, sexual sins, murders, thefts, <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> covetings, wickedness, deceit, lustful
desires, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, and foolishness. <span
class="bibleverse">23</span> All these evil things come from within and
defile the man.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">24</span> From there he arose and went away
into the borders of Tyre and Sidon. He entered into a house and didn’t
want anyone to know it, but he couldn’t escape notice. <span
class="bibleverse">25</span> For a woman whose little daughter had an
unclean spirit, having heard of him, came and fell down at his feet.
<span class="bibleverse">26</span> Now the woman was a Greek, a
Syrophoenician by race. She begged him that he would cast the demon out
of her daughter. <span class="bibleverse">27</span> But Jesus said to
her, “Let the children be filled first, for it is not appropriate to
take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">28</span> But she answered him, “Yes, Lord.
Yet even the dogs under the table eat the children’s crumbs.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">29</span> He said to her, “For this saying,
go your way. The demon has gone out of your daughter.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">30</span> She went away to her house, and
found the child having been laid on the bed, with the demon gone
out.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">31</span> Again he departed from the borders
of Tyre and Sidon, and came to the sea of Galilee through the middle of
the region of Decapolis. <span class="bibleverse">32</span> They brought
to him one who was deaf and had an impediment in his speech. They begged
him to lay his hand on him. <span class="bibleverse">33</span> He took
him aside from the multitude privately and put his fingers into his
ears; and he spat and touched his tongue. <span
class="bibleverse">34</span> Looking up to heaven, he sighed, and said
to him, “Ephphatha!” that is, “Be opened!” <span
class="bibleverse">35</span> Immediately his ears were opened, and the
impediment of his tongue was released, and he spoke clearly. <span
class="bibleverse">36</span> He commanded them that they should tell no
one, but the more he commanded them, so much the more widely they
proclaimed it. <span class="bibleverse">37</span> They were astonished
beyond measure, saying, “He has done all things well. He makes even the
deaf hear and the mute speak!”</p>
<h1 id="section-7">8</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> In those days, when there was a
very great multitude, and they had nothing to eat, Jesus called his
disciples to himself and said to them, <span class="bibleverse">2</span>
“I have compassion on the multitude, because they have stayed with me
now three days and have nothing to eat. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> If I send them away fasting to their home,
they will faint on the way, for some of them have come a long way.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">4</span> His disciples answered him, “From
where could one satisfy these people with bread here in a deserted
place?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">5</span> He asked them, “How many loaves do
you have?”</p>
<p>They said, “Seven.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">6</span> He commanded the multitude to sit
down on the ground, and he took the seven loaves. Having given thanks,
he broke them and gave them to his disciples to serve, and they served
the multitude. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> They also had a few
small fish. Having blessed them, he said to serve these also. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> They ate and were filled. They took up seven
baskets of broken pieces that were left over. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> Those who had eaten were about four
thousand. Then he sent them away.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">10</span> Immediately he entered into the
boat with his disciples and came into the region of Dalmanutha. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> The Pharisees came out and began to
question him, seeking from him a sign from heaven and testing him. <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> He sighed deeply in his spirit and said,
“Why does this generation<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> seek a sign? Most
certainly I tell you, no sign will be given to this generation.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">13</span> He left them, and again entering
into the boat, departed to the other side. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> They forgot to take bread; and they didn’t
have more than one loaf in the boat with them. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> He warned them, saying, “Take heed: beware
of the yeast of the Pharisees and the yeast of Herod.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">16</span> They reasoned with one another,
saying, “It’s because we have no bread.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">17</span> Jesus, perceiving it, said to
them, “Why do you reason that it’s because you have no bread? Don’t you
perceive yet or understand? Is your heart still hardened? <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> Having eyes, don’t you see? Having ears,
don’t you hear? Don’t you remember? <span class="bibleverse">19</span>
When I broke the five loaves among the five thousand, how many baskets
full of broken pieces did you take up?”</p>
<p>They told him, “Twelve.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">20</span> “When the seven loaves fed the
four thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take
up?”</p>
<p>They told him, “Seven.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">21</span> He asked them, “Don’t you
understand yet?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">22</span> He came to Bethsaida. They brought
a blind man to him and begged him to touch him. <span
class="bibleverse">23</span> He took hold of the blind man by the hand,
and brought him out of the village. When he had spat on his eyes, and
laid his hands on him, he asked him if he saw anything.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">24</span> He looked up, and said, “I see
men, but I see them like walking trees.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">25</span> Then again he laid his hands on
his eyes. He looked intently, and was restored, and saw everyone
clearly. <span class="bibleverse">26</span> He sent him away to his
house, saying, “Don’t enter into the village, nor tell anyone in the
village.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">27</span> Jesus went out, with his
disciples, into the villages of Caesarea Philippi. On the way he asked
his disciples, “Who do men say that I am?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">28</span> They told him, “John the Baptizer,
and others say Elijah, but others, one of the prophets.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">29</span> He said to them, “But who do you
say that I am?”</p>
<p>Peter answered, “You are the Christ.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">30</span> He commanded them that they should
tell no one about him. <span class="bibleverse">31</span> He began to
teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected
by the elders, the chief priests, and the scribes, and be killed, and
after three days rise again. <span class="bibleverse">32</span> He spoke
to them openly. Peter took him and began to rebuke him. <span
class="bibleverse">33</span> But he, turning around and seeing his
disciples, rebuked Peter, and said, “Get behind me, Satan! For you have
in mind not the things of God, but the things of men.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">34</span> He called the multitude to himself
with his disciples and said to them, “Whoever wants to come after me,
let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. <span
class="bibleverse">35</span> For whoever wants to save his life will
lose it; and whoever will lose his life for my sake and the sake of the
Good News will save it. <span class="bibleverse">36</span> For what does
it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his life? <span
class="bibleverse">37</span> For what will a man give in exchange for
his life? <span class="bibleverse">38</span> For whoever will be ashamed
of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son
of Man also will be ashamed of him when he comes in his Father’s glory
with the holy angels.”</p>
<h1 id="section-8">9</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> He said to them, “Most certainly I
tell you, there are some standing here who will in no way taste death
until they see God’s Kingdom come with power.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">2</span> After six days Jesus took with him
Peter, James, and John, and brought them up onto a high mountain
privately by themselves, and he was changed into another form in front
of them. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> His clothing became
glistening, exceedingly white, like snow, such as no launderer on earth
can whiten them. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> Elijah and Moses
appeared to them, and they were talking with Jesus.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">5</span> Peter answered Jesus, “Rabbi, it is
good for us to be here. Let’s make three tents: one for you, one for
Moses, and one for Elijah.” <span class="bibleverse">6</span> For he
didn’t know what to say, for they were very afraid.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">7</span> A cloud came, overshadowing them,
and a voice came out of the cloud, “This is my beloved Son. Listen to
him.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">8</span> Suddenly looking around, they saw
no one with them any more, except Jesus only.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">9</span> As they were coming down from the
mountain, he commanded them that they should tell no one what things
they had seen, until after the Son of Man had risen from the dead. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> They kept this saying to themselves,
questioning what the “rising from the dead” meant.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">11</span> They asked him, saying, “Why do
the scribes say that Elijah must come first?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">12</span> He said to them, “Elijah indeed
comes first, and restores all things. How is it written about the Son of
Man, that he should suffer many things and be despised? <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> But I tell you that Elijah has come, and
they have also done to him whatever they wanted to, even as it is
written about him.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">14</span> Coming to the disciples, he saw a
great multitude around them, and scribes questioning them. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> Immediately all the multitude, when they
saw him, were greatly amazed, and running to him, greeted him. <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> He asked the scribes, “What are you asking
them?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">17</span> One of the multitude answered,
“Teacher, I brought to you my son, who has a mute spirit; <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> and wherever it seizes him, it throws him
down; and he foams at the mouth, grinds his teeth, and becomes rigid. I
asked your disciples to cast it out, and they weren’t able.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">19</span> He answered him, “Unbelieving
generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with
you? Bring him to me.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">20</span> They brought him to him, and when
he saw him, immediately the spirit convulsed him and he fell on the
ground, wallowing and foaming at the mouth.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">21</span> He asked his father, “How long has
it been since this has been happening to him?”</p>
<p>He said, “From childhood. <span class="bibleverse">22</span> Often it
has cast him both into the fire and into the water to destroy him. But
if you can do anything, have compassion on us and help us.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">23</span> Jesus said to him, “If you can
believe, all things are possible to him who believes.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">24</span> Immediately the father of the
child cried out with tears, “I believe. Help my unbelief!”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">25</span> When Jesus saw that a multitude
came running together, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to him,
“You mute and deaf spirit, I command you, come out of him, and never
enter him again!”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">26</span> After crying out and convulsing
him greatly, it came out of him. The boy became like one dead, so much
that most of them said, “He is dead.” <span class="bibleverse">27</span>
But Jesus took him by the hand and raised him up; and he arose.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">28</span> When he had come into the house,
his disciples asked him privately, “Why couldn’t we cast it out?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">29</span> He said to them, “This kind can
come out by nothing but by prayer and fasting.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">30</span> They went out from there and
passed through Galilee. He didn’t want anyone to know it, <span
class="bibleverse">31</span> for he was teaching his disciples, and said
to them, “The Son of Man is being handed over to the hands of men, and
they will kill him; and when he is killed, on the third day he will rise
again.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">32</span> But they didn’t understand the
saying, and were afraid to ask him.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">33</span> He came to Capernaum, and when he
was in the house he asked them, “What were you arguing among yourselves
on the way?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">34</span> But they were silent, for they had
disputed with one another on the way about who was the greatest.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">35</span> He sat down and called the twelve;
and he said to them, “If any man wants to be first, he shall be last of
all, and servant of all.” <span class="bibleverse">36</span> He took a
little child and set him in the middle of them. Taking him in his arms,
he said to them, <span class="bibleverse">37</span> “Whoever receives
one such little child in my name receives me; and whoever receives me,
doesn’t receive me, but him who sent me.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">38</span> John said to him, “Teacher, we saw
someone who doesn’t follow us casting out demons in your name; and we
forbade him, because he doesn’t follow us.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">39</span> But Jesus said, “Don’t forbid him,
for there is no one who will do a mighty work in my name and be able
quickly to speak evil of me. <span class="bibleverse">40</span> For
whoever is not against us is on our side. <span
class="bibleverse">41</span> For whoever will give you a cup of water to
drink in my name because you are Christ’s, most certainly I tell you, he
will in no way lose his reward.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">42</span> “Whoever will cause one of these
little ones who believe in me to stumble, it would be better for him if
he were thrown into the sea with a millstone hung around his neck. <span
class="bibleverse">43</span> If your hand causes you to stumble, cut it
off. It is better for you to enter into life maimed, rather than having
your two hands to go into Gehenna, <a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref"

<h1 id="section-9">10</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> He arose from there and came into
the borders of Judea and beyond the Jordan. Multitudes came together to
him again. As he usually did, he was again teaching them.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">2</span> Pharisees came to him testing him,
and asked him, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">3</span> He answered, “What did Moses
command you?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">4</span> They said, “Moses allowed a
certificate of divorce to be written, and to divorce her.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">5</span> But Jesus said to them, “For your
hardness of heart, he wrote you this commandment. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> But from the beginning of the creation, God
made them male and female.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a> <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> For this cause a man will leave his father
and mother, and will join to his wife, <span class="bibleverse">8</span>
and the two will become one flesh,<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a> so that they are no
longer two, but one flesh. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> What
therefore God has joined together, let no man separate.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">10</span> In the house, his disciples asked
him again about the same matter. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> He
said to them, “Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits
adultery against her. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> If a woman
herself divorces her husband and marries another, she commits
adultery.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">13</span> They were bringing to him little
children, that he should touch them, but the disciples rebuked those who
were bringing them. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> But when Jesus
saw it, he was moved with indignation and said to them, “Allow the
little children to come to me! Don’t forbid them, for God’s Kingdom
belongs to such as these. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> Most
certainly I tell you, whoever will not receive God’s Kingdom like a
little child, he will in no way enter into it.” <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> He took them in his arms and blessed them,
laying his hands on them.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">17</span> As he was going out into the way,
one ran to him, knelt before him, and asked him, “Good Teacher, what
shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">18</span> Jesus said to him, “Why do you
call me good? No one is good except one—God. <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> You know the commandments: ‘Do not murder,’
‘Do not commit adultery,’ ‘Do not steal,’ ‘Do not give false testimony,’
‘Do not defraud,’ ‘Honor your father and mother.’”<a href="#fn34"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">20</span> He said to him, “Teacher, I have
observed all these things from my youth.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">21</span> Jesus looking at him loved him,
and said to him, “One thing you lack. Go, sell whatever you have and
give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow
me, taking up the cross.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">22</span> But his face fell at that saying,
and he went away sorrowful, for he was one who had great
possessions.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">23</span> Jesus looked around and said to
his disciples, “How difficult it is for those who have riches to enter
into God’s Kingdom!”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">24</span> The disciples were amazed at his
words. But Jesus answered again, “Children, how hard it is for those who
trust in riches to enter into God’s Kingdom! <span
class="bibleverse">25</span> It is easier for a camel to go through a
needle’s eye than for a rich man to enter into God’s Kingdom.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">26</span> They were exceedingly astonished,
saying to him, “Then who can be saved?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">27</span> Jesus, looking at them, said,
“With men it is impossible, but not with God, for all things are
possible with God.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">28</span> Peter began to tell him, “Behold,
we have left all and have followed you.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">29</span> Jesus said, “Most certainly I tell
you, there is no one who has left house, or brothers, or sisters, or
father, or mother, or wife, or children, or land, for my sake, and for
the sake of the Good News, <span class="bibleverse">30</span> but he
will receive one hundred times more now in this time: houses, brothers,
sisters, mothers, children, and land, with persecutions; and in the age
to come eternal life. <span class="bibleverse">31</span> But many who
are first will be last, and the last first.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">32</span> They were on the way, going up to
Jerusalem; and Jesus was going in front of them, and they were amazed;
and those who followed were afraid. He again took the twelve, and began
to tell them the things that were going to happen to him. <span
class="bibleverse">33</span> “Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem. The
Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and the scribes. They
will condemn him to death, and will deliver him to the Gentiles. <span
class="bibleverse">34</span> They will mock him, spit on him, scourge
him, and kill him. On the third day he will rise again.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">35</span> James and John, the sons of
Zebedee, came near to him, saying, “Teacher, we want you to do for us
whatever we will ask.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">36</span> He said to them, “What do you want
me to do for you?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">37</span> They said to him, “Grant to us
that we may sit, one at your right hand and one at your left hand, in
your glory.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">38</span> But Jesus said to them, “You don’t
know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink,
and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">39</span> They said to him, “We are
able.”</p>
<p>Jesus said to them, “You shall indeed drink the cup that I drink, and
you shall be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with; <span
class="bibleverse">40</span> but to sit at my right hand and at my left
hand is not mine to give, but for whom it has been prepared.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">41</span> When the ten heard it, they began
to be indignant toward James and John.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">42</span> Jesus summoned them and said to
them, “You know that they who are recognized as rulers over the nations
lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them.
<span class="bibleverse">43</span> But it shall not be so among you, but
whoever wants to become great among you shall be your servant. <span
class="bibleverse">44</span> Whoever of you wants to become first among
you shall be bondservant of all. <span class="bibleverse">45</span> For
the Son of Man also came not to be served but to serve, and to give his
life as a ransom for many.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">46</span> They came to Jericho. As he went
out from Jericho with his disciples and a great multitude, the son of
Timaeus, Bartimaeus, a blind beggar, was sitting by the road. <span
class="bibleverse">47</span> When he heard that it was Jesus the
Nazarene, he began to cry out and say, “Jesus, you son of David, have
mercy on me!” <span class="bibleverse">48</span> Many rebuked him, that
he should be quiet, but he cried out much more, “You son of David, have
mercy on me!”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">49</span> Jesus stood still and said, “Call
him.”</p>
<p>They called the blind man, saying to him, “Cheer up! Get up. He is
calling you!”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">50</span> He, casting away his cloak, sprang
up, and came to Jesus.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">51</span> Jesus asked him, “What do you want
me to do for you?”</p>
<p>The blind man said to him, “Rabboni,<a href="#fn35"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a>
that I may see again.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">52</span> Jesus said to him, “Go your way.
Your faith has made you well.” Immediately he received his sight and
followed Jesus on the way.</p>
<h1 id="section-10">11</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> When they came near to Jerusalem,
to Bethsphage<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a> and Bethany, at the Mount of
Olives, he sent two of his disciples <span class="bibleverse">2</span>
and said to them, “Go your way into the village that is opposite you.
Immediately as you enter into it, you will find a young donkey tied, on
which no one has sat. Untie him and bring him. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> If anyone asks you, ‘Why are you doing
this?’ say, ‘The Lord needs him;’ and immediately he will send him back
here.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">4</span> They went away, and found a young
donkey tied at the door outside in the open street, and they untied him.
<span class="bibleverse">5</span> Some of those who stood there asked
them, “What are you doing, untying the young donkey?” <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> They said to them just as Jesus had said,
and they let them go.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">7</span> They brought the young donkey to
Jesus and threw their garments on it, and Jesus sat on it. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> Many spread their garments on the way, and
others were cutting down branches from the trees and spreading them on
the road. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> Those who went in front and
those who followed cried out, “Hosanna!<a href="#fn37"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37" role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a>
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!<a href="#fn38"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38" role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a>
<span class="bibleverse">10</span> Blessed is the kingdom of our father
David that is coming in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the
highest!”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">11</span> Jesus entered into the temple in
Jerusalem. When he had looked around at everything, it being now
evening, he went out to Bethany with the twelve.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">12</span> The next day, when they had come
out from Bethany, he was hungry. <span class="bibleverse">13</span>
Seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came to see if perhaps he
might find anything on it. When he came to it, he found nothing but
leaves, for it was not the season for figs. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> Jesus told it, “May no one ever eat fruit
from you again!” and his disciples heard it.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">15</span> They came to Jerusalem, and Jesus
entered into the temple and began to throw out those who sold and those
who bought in the temple, and overthrew the money changers’ tables and
the seats of those who sold the doves. <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> He would not allow anyone to carry a
container through the temple. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> He
taught, saying to them, “Isn’t it written, ‘My house will be called a
house of prayer for all the nations?’<a href="#fn39"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39" role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a>
But you have made it a den of robbers!”<a href="#fn40"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">18</span> The chief priests and the scribes
heard it, and sought how they might destroy him. For they feared him,
because all the multitude was astonished at his teaching.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">19</span> When evening came, he went out of
the city. <span class="bibleverse">20</span> As they passed by in the
morning, they saw the fig tree withered away from the roots. <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> Peter, remembering, said to him, “Rabbi,
look! The fig tree which you cursed has withered away.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">22</span> Jesus answered them, “Have faith
in God. <span class="bibleverse">23</span> For most certainly I tell
you, whoever may tell this mountain, ‘Be taken up and cast into the
sea,’ and doesn’t doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says is
happening, he shall have whatever he says. <span
class="bibleverse">24</span> Therefore I tell you, all things whatever
you pray and ask for, believe that you have received them, and you shall
have them. <span class="bibleverse">25</span> Whenever you stand
praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone; so that your
Father, who is in heaven, may also forgive you your transgressions.
<span class="bibleverse">26</span> But if you do not forgive, neither
will your Father in heaven forgive your transgressions.”<a href="#fn41"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">27</span> They came again to Jerusalem, and
as he was walking in the temple, the chief priests, the scribes, and the
elders came to him, <span class="bibleverse">28</span> and they began
saying to him, “By what authority do you do these things? Or who gave
you this authority to do these things?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">29</span> Jesus said to them, “I will ask
you one question. Answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do
these things. <span class="bibleverse">30</span> The baptism of John—was
it from heaven, or from men? Answer me.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">31</span> They reasoned with themselves,
saying, “If we should say, ‘From heaven;’ he will say, ‘Why then did you
not believe him?’ <span class="bibleverse">32</span> If we should say,
‘From men’”—they feared the people, for all held John to really be a
prophet. <span class="bibleverse">33</span> They answered Jesus, “We
don’t know.”</p>
<p>Jesus said to them, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I do
these things.”</p>
<h1 id="section-11">12</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> He began to speak to them in
parables. “A man planted a vineyard, put a hedge around it, dug a pit
for the wine press, built a tower, rented it out to a farmer, and went
into another country. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> When it was
time, he sent a servant to the farmer to get from the farmer his share
of the fruit of the vineyard. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> They
took him, beat him, and sent him away empty. <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> Again, he sent another servant to them; and
they threw stones at him, wounded him in the head, and sent him away
shamefully treated. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> Again he sent
another, and they killed him, and many others, beating some, and killing
some. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> Therefore still having one, his
beloved son, he sent him last to them, saying, ‘They will respect my
son.’ <span class="bibleverse">7</span> But those farmers said among
themselves, ‘This is the heir. Come, let’s kill him, and the inheritance
will be ours.’ <span class="bibleverse">8</span> They took him, killed
him, and cast him out of the vineyard. <span class="bibleverse">9</span>
What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do? He will come and
destroy the farmers, and will give the vineyard to others. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> Haven’t you even read this Scripture: ‘The
stone which the builders rejected was made the head of the corner. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> This was from the Lord. It is marvelous in
our eyes’?”<a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">12</span> They tried to seize him, but they
feared the multitude; for they perceived that he spoke the parable
against them. They left him and went away. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> They sent some of the Pharisees and the
Herodians to him, that they might trap him with words. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> When they had come, they asked him,
“Teacher, we know that you are honest, and don’t defer to anyone; for
you aren’t partial to anyone, but truly teach the way of God. Is it
lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not? <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> Shall we give, or shall we not give?”</p>
<p>But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, “Why do you test me?
Bring me a denarius, that I may see it.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">16</span> They brought it.</p>
<p>He said to them, “Whose is this image and inscription?”</p>
<p>They said to him, “Caesar’s.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">17</span> Jesus answered them, “Render to
Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are
God’s.”</p>
<p>They marveled greatly at him.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">18</span> Some Sadducees, who say that there
is no resurrection, came to him. They asked him, saying, <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> “Teacher, Moses wrote to us, ‘If a man’s
brother dies and leaves a wife behind him, and leaves no children, that
his brother should take his wife and raise up offspring for his
brother.’ <span class="bibleverse">20</span> There were seven brothers.
The first took a wife, and dying left no offspring. <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> The second took her, and died, leaving no
children behind him. The third likewise; <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> and the seven took her and left no
children. Last of all the woman also died. <span
class="bibleverse">23</span> In the resurrection, when they rise, whose
wife will she be of them? For the seven had her as a wife.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">24</span> Jesus answered them, “Isn’t this
because you are mistaken, not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of
God? <span class="bibleverse">25</span> For when they will rise from the
dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels
in heaven. <span class="bibleverse">26</span> But about the dead, that
they are raised, haven’t you read in the book of Moses about the Bush,
how God spoke to him, saying, ‘I am the God of Abraham, the God of
Isaac, and the God of Jacob’?<a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref43" role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a> <span
class="bibleverse">27</span> He is not the God of the dead, but of the
living. You are therefore badly mistaken.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">28</span> One of the scribes came and heard
them questioning together, and knowing that he had answered them well,
asked him, “Which commandment is the greatest of all?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">29</span> Jesus answered, “The greatest is:
‘Hear, Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one. <span
class="bibleverse">30</span> You shall love the Lord your God with all
your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your
strength.’<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a> This is the first commandment.
<span class="bibleverse">31</span> The second is like this: ‘You shall
love your neighbor as yourself.’<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref45" role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a> There is no other
commandment greater than these.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">32</span> The scribe said to him, “Truly,
teacher, you have said well that he is one, and there is none other but
he; <span class="bibleverse">33</span> and to love him with all the
heart, with all the understanding, all the soul, and with all the
strength, and to love his neighbor as himself, is more important than
all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">34</span> When Jesus saw that he answered
wisely, he said to him, “You are not far from God’s Kingdom.”</p>
<p>No one dared ask him any question after that. <span
class="bibleverse">35</span> Jesus responded, as he taught in the
temple, “How is it that the scribes say that the Christ is the son of
David? <span class="bibleverse">36</span> For David himself said in the
Holy Spirit, ‘The Lord said to my Lord, “Sit at my right hand, until I
make your enemies the footstool of your feet.”’<a href="#fn46"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">37</span> Therefore David himself calls him
Lord, so how can he be his son?”</p>
<p>The common people heard him gladly. <span
class="bibleverse">38</span> In his teaching he said to them, “Beware of
the scribes, who like to walk in long robes, and to get greetings in the
marketplaces, <span class="bibleverse">39</span> and to get the best
seats in the synagogues and the best places at feasts, <span
class="bibleverse">40</span> those who devour widows’ houses, and for a
pretense make long prayers. These will receive greater
condemnation.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">41</span> Jesus sat down opposite the
treasury and saw how the multitude cast money into the treasury. Many
who were rich cast in much. <span class="bibleverse">42</span> A poor
widow came and she cast in two small brass coins,<a href="#fn47"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47" role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a>
which equal a quadrans coin.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref48" role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a> <span
class="bibleverse">43</span> He called his disciples to himself and said
to them, “Most certainly I tell you, this poor widow gave more than all
those who are giving into the treasury, <span
class="bibleverse">44</span> for they all gave out of their abundance,
but she, out of her poverty, gave all that she had to live on.”</p>
<h1 id="section-12">13</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> As he went out of the temple, one
of his disciples said to him, “Teacher, see what kind of stones and what
kind of buildings!”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">2</span> Jesus said to him, “Do you see
these great buildings? There will not be left here one stone on another,
which will not be thrown down.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">3</span> As he sat on the Mount of Olives
opposite the temple, Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked him privately,
<span class="bibleverse">4</span> “Tell us, when will these things be?
What is the sign that these things are all about to be fulfilled?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">5</span> Jesus, answering, began to tell
them, “Be careful that no one leads you astray. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> For many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am
he!’<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a> and will lead many astray.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">7</span> “When you hear of wars and rumors
of wars, don’t be troubled. For those must happen, but the end is not
yet. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> For nation will rise against
nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in
various places. There will be famines and troubles. These things are the
beginning of birth pains.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">9</span> “But watch yourselves, for they
will deliver you up to councils. You will be beaten in synagogues. You
will stand before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony to them.
<span class="bibleverse">10</span> The Good News must first be preached
to all the nations. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> When they lead
you away and deliver you up, don’t be anxious beforehand or premeditate
what you will say, but say whatever will be given you in that hour. For
it is not you who speak, but the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">12</span> “Brother will deliver up brother
to death, and the father his child. Children will rise up against
parents and cause them to be put to death. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> You will be hated by all men for my name’s
sake, but he who endures to the end will be saved.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">14</span> “But when you see the abomination
of desolation,<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>50</sup></a> spoken of by Daniel the prophet,
standing where it ought not” (let the reader understand), “then let
those who are in Judea flee to the mountains, <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> and let him who is on the housetop not go
down, nor enter in, to take anything out of his house. <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> Let him who is in the field not return back
to take his cloak. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> But woe to those
who are with child and to those who nurse babies in those days! <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> Pray that your flight won’t be in the
winter. <span class="bibleverse">19</span> For in those days there will
be oppression, such as there has not been the like from the beginning of
the creation which God created until now, and never will be. <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> Unless the Lord had shortened the days, no
flesh would have been saved; but for the sake of the chosen ones, whom
he picked out, he shortened the days. <span class="bibleverse">21</span>
Then if anyone tells you, ‘Look, here is the Christ!’ or, ‘Look, there!’
don’t believe it. <span class="bibleverse">22</span> For false christs
and false prophets will arise and will show signs and wonders, that they
may lead astray, if possible, even the chosen ones. <span
class="bibleverse">23</span> But you watch.</p>
<p>“Behold, I have told you all things beforehand. <span
class="bibleverse">24</span> But in those days, after that oppression,
the sun will be darkened, the moon will not give its light, <span
class="bibleverse">25</span> the stars will be falling from the sky, and
the powers that are in the heavens will be shaken.<a href="#fn51"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51" role="doc-noteref"><sup>51</sup></a>
<span class="bibleverse">26</span> Then they will see the Son of Man
coming in clouds with great power and glory. <span
class="bibleverse">27</span> Then he will send out his angels, and will
gather together his chosen ones from the four winds, from the ends of
the earth to the ends of the sky.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">28</span> “Now from the fig tree, learn this
parable. When the branch has now become tender and produces its leaves,
you know that the summer is near; <span class="bibleverse">29</span>
even so you also, when you see these things coming to pass, know that it
is near, at the doors. <span class="bibleverse">30</span> Most certainly
I say to you, this generation<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref52" role="doc-noteref"><sup>52</sup></a> will not pass away
until all these things happen. <span class="bibleverse">31</span> Heaven
and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">32</span> “But of that day or that hour no
one knows—not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the
Father. <span class="bibleverse">33</span> Watch, keep alert, and pray;
for you don’t know when the time is.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">34</span> “It is like a man traveling to
another country, having left his house and given authority to his
servants, and to each one his work, and also commanded the doorkeeper to
keep watch. <span class="bibleverse">35</span> Watch therefore, for you
don’t know when the lord of the house is coming—whether at evening, or
at midnight, or when the rooster crows, or in the morning; <span
class="bibleverse">36</span> lest, coming suddenly, he might find you
sleeping. <span class="bibleverse">37</span> What I tell you, I tell
all: Watch!”</p>
<h1 id="section-13">14</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> It was now two days before the
Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread, and the chief priests and
the scribes sought how they might seize him by deception and kill him.
<span class="bibleverse">2</span> For they said, “Not during the feast,
because there might be a riot among the people.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">3</span> While he was at Bethany, in the
house of Simon the leper, as he sat at the table, a woman came having an
alabaster jar of ointment of pure nard—very costly. She broke the jar
and poured it over his head. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> But there
were some who were indignant among themselves, saying, “Why has this
ointment been wasted? <span class="bibleverse">5</span> For this might
have been sold for more than three hundred denarii<a href="#fn53"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53" role="doc-noteref"><sup>53</sup></a>
and given to the poor.” So they grumbled against her.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">6</span> But Jesus said, “Leave her alone.
Why do you trouble her? She has done a good work for me. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> For you always have the poor with you, and
whenever you want to, you can do them good; but you will not always have
me. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> She has done what she could. She
has anointed my body beforehand for the burying. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> Most certainly I tell you, wherever this
Good News may be preached throughout the whole world, that which this
woman has done will also be spoken of for a memorial of her.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">10</span> Judas Iscariot, who was one of the
twelve, went away to the chief priests, that he might deliver him to
them. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> They, when they heard it, were
glad, and promised to give him money. He sought how he might
conveniently deliver him.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">12</span> On the first day of unleavened
bread, when they sacrificed the Passover, his disciples asked him,
“Where do you want us to go and prepare that you may eat the
Passover?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">13</span> He sent two of his disciples and
said to them, “Go into the city, and there a man carrying a pitcher of
water will meet you. Follow him, <span class="bibleverse">14</span> and
wherever he enters in, tell the master of the house, ‘The Teacher says,
“Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my
disciples?”’ <span class="bibleverse">15</span> He will himself show you
a large upper room furnished and ready. Get ready for us there.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">16</span> His disciples went out, and came
into the city, and found things as he had said to them, and they
prepared the Passover.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">17</span> When it was evening he came with
the twelve. <span class="bibleverse">18</span> As they sat and were
eating, Jesus said, “Most certainly I tell you, one of you will betray
me—he who eats with me.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">19</span> They began to be sorrowful, and to
ask him one by one, “Surely not I?” And another said, “Surely not
I?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">20</span> He answered them, “It is one of
the twelve, he who dips with me in the dish. <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> For the Son of Man goes as it is written
about him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It
would be better for that man if he had not been born.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">22</span> As they were eating, Jesus took
bread, and when he had blessed it, he broke it and gave to them, and
said, “Take, eat. This is my body.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">23</span> He took the cup, and when he had
given thanks, he gave to them. They all drank of it. <span
class="bibleverse">24</span> He said to them, “This is my blood of the
new covenant, which is poured out for many. <span
class="bibleverse">25</span> Most certainly I tell you, I will no more
drink of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it anew in
God’s Kingdom.” <span class="bibleverse">26</span> When they had sung a
hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">27</span> Jesus said to them, “All of you
will be made to stumble because of me tonight, for it is written, ‘I
will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.’<a
href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>54</sup></a> <span class="bibleverse">28</span>
However, after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">29</span> But Peter said to him, “Although
all will be offended, yet I will not.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">30</span> Jesus said to him, “Most certainly
I tell you that you today, even this night, before the rooster crows
twice, you will deny me three times.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">31</span> But he spoke all the more, “If I
must die with you, I will not deny you.” They all said the same
thing.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">32</span> They came to a place which was
named Gethsemane. He said to his disciples, “Sit here while I pray.”
<span class="bibleverse">33</span> He took with him Peter, James, and
John, and began to be greatly troubled and distressed. <span
class="bibleverse">34</span> He said to them, “My soul is exceedingly
sorrowful, even to death. Stay here and watch.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">35</span> He went forward a little, and fell
on the ground, and prayed that if it were possible, the hour might pass
away from him. <span class="bibleverse">36</span> He said, “Abba,<a
href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>55</sup></a> Father, all things are possible to
you. Please remove this cup from me. However, not what I desire, but
what you desire.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">37</span> He came and found them sleeping,
and said to Peter, “Simon, are you sleeping? Couldn’t you watch one
hour? <span class="bibleverse">38</span> Watch and pray, that you may
not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh
is weak.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">39</span> Again he went away and prayed,
saying the same words. <span class="bibleverse">40</span> Again he
returned and found them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy; and
they didn’t know what to answer him. <span class="bibleverse">41</span>
He came the third time and said to them, “Sleep on now, and take your
rest. It is enough. The hour has come. Behold, the Son of Man is
betrayed into the hands of sinners. <span class="bibleverse">42</span>
Arise! Let’s get going. Behold, he who betrays me is at hand.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">43</span> Immediately, while he was still
speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, came—and with him a multitude with
swords and clubs, from the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders.
<span class="bibleverse">44</span> Now he who betrayed him had given
them a sign, saying, “Whomever I will kiss, that is he. Seize him, and
lead him away safely.” <span class="bibleverse">45</span> When he had
come, immediately he came to him and said, “Rabbi! Rabbi!” and kissed
him. <span class="bibleverse">46</span> They laid their hands on him and
seized him. <span class="bibleverse">47</span> But a certain one of
those who stood by drew his sword and struck the servant of the high
priest, and cut off his ear.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">48</span> Jesus answered them, “Have you
come out, as against a robber, with swords and clubs to seize me? <span
class="bibleverse">49</span> I was daily with you in the temple
teaching, and you didn’t arrest me. But this is so that the Scriptures
might be fulfilled.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">50</span> They all left him, and fled. <span
class="bibleverse">51</span> A certain young man followed him, having a
linen cloth thrown around himself over his naked body. The young men
grabbed him, <span class="bibleverse">52</span> but he left the linen
cloth and fled from them naked. <span class="bibleverse">53</span> They
led Jesus away to the high priest. All the chief priests, the elders,
and the scribes came together with him.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">54</span> Peter had followed him from a
distance, until he came into the court of the high priest. He was
sitting with the officers, and warming himself in the light of the fire.
<span class="bibleverse">55</span> Now the chief priests and the whole
council sought witnesses against Jesus to put him to death, and found
none. <span class="bibleverse">56</span> For many gave false testimony
against him, and their testimony didn’t agree with each other. <span
class="bibleverse">57</span> Some stood up and gave false testimony
against him, saying, <span class="bibleverse">58</span> “We heard him
say, ‘I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three
days I will build another made without hands.’” <span
class="bibleverse">59</span> Even so, their testimony didn’t agree.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">60</span> The high priest stood up in the
middle, and asked Jesus, “Have you no answer? What is it which these
testify against you?” <span class="bibleverse">61</span> But he stayed
quiet, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, “Are you
the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">62</span> Jesus said, “I am. You will see
the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming with the
clouds of the sky.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">63</span> The high priest tore his clothes
and said, “What further need have we of witnesses? <span
class="bibleverse">64</span> You have heard the blasphemy! What do you
think?” They all condemned him to be worthy of death. <span
class="bibleverse">65</span> Some began to spit on him, and to cover his
face, and to beat him with fists, and to tell him, “Prophesy!” The
officers struck him with the palms of their hands.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">66</span> As Peter was in the courtyard
below, one of the maids of the high priest came, <span
class="bibleverse">67</span> and seeing Peter warming himself, she
looked at him and said, “You were also with the Nazarene, Jesus!”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">68</span> But he denied it, saying, “I
neither know nor understand what you are saying.” He went out on the
porch, and the rooster crowed.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">69</span> The maid saw him and began again
to tell those who stood by, “This is one of them.” <span
class="bibleverse">70</span> But he again denied it. After a little
while again those who stood by said to Peter, “You truly are one of
them, for you are a Galilean, and your speech shows it.” <span
class="bibleverse">71</span> But he began to curse and to swear, “I
don’t know this man of whom you speak!”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">72</span> The rooster crowed the second
time. Peter remembered the words that Jesus said to him, “Before the
rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times.” When he thought
about that, he wept.</p>
<h1 id="section-14">15</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Immediately in the morning the
chief priests, with the elders, scribes, and the whole council, held a
consultation, bound Jesus, carried him away, and delivered him up to
Pilate. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> Pilate asked him, “Are you the
King of the Jews?”</p>
<p>He answered, “So you say.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">3</span> The chief priests accused him of
many things. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> Pilate again asked him,
“Have you no answer? See how many things they testify against you!”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">5</span> But Jesus made no further answer,
so that Pilate marveled.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">6</span> Now at the feast he used to release
to them one prisoner, whomever they asked of him. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> There was one called Barabbas, bound with
his fellow insurgents, men who in the insurrection had committed murder.
<span class="bibleverse">8</span> The multitude, crying aloud, began to
ask him to do as he always did for them. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> Pilate answered them, saying, “Do you want
me to release to you the King of the Jews?” <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> For he perceived that for envy the chief
priests had delivered him up. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> But the
chief priests stirred up the multitude, that he should release Barabbas
to them instead. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> Pilate again asked
them, “What then should I do to him whom you call the King of the
Jews?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">13</span> They cried out again, “Crucify
him!”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">14</span> Pilate said to them, “Why, what
evil has he done?”</p>
<p>But they cried out exceedingly, “Crucify him!”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">15</span> Pilate, wishing to please the
multitude, released Barabbas to them, and handed over Jesus, when he had
flogged him, to be crucified.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">16</span> The soldiers led him away within
the court, which is the Praetorium; and they called together the whole
cohort. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> They clothed him with purple;
and weaving a crown of thorns, they put it on him. <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> They began to salute him, “Hail, King of
the Jews!” <span class="bibleverse">19</span> They struck his head with
a reed and spat on him, and bowing their knees, did homage to him. <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> When they had mocked him, they took the
purple cloak off him, and put his own garments on him. They led him out
to crucify him.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">21</span> They compelled one passing by,
coming from the country, Simon of Cyrene, the father of Alexander and
Rufus, to go with them that he might bear his cross. <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> They brought him to the place called
Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, “The place of a skull.” <span
class="bibleverse">23</span> They offered him wine mixed with myrrh to
drink, but he didn’t take it.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">24</span> Crucifying him, they parted his
garments among them, casting lots on them, what each should take. <span
class="bibleverse">25</span> It was the third hour<a href="#fn56"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56" role="doc-noteref"><sup>56</sup></a>
when they crucified him. <span class="bibleverse">26</span> The
superscription of his accusation was written over him: “THE KING OF THE
JEWS.” <span class="bibleverse">27</span> With him they crucified two
robbers, one on his right hand, and one on his left. <span
class="bibleverse">28</span> The Scripture was fulfilled which says, “He
was counted with transgressors.”<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref57" role="doc-noteref"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">29</span> Those who passed by blasphemed
him, wagging their heads and saying, “Ha! You who destroy the temple and
build it in three days, <span class="bibleverse">30</span> save
yourself, and come down from the cross!”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">31</span> Likewise, also the chief priests
mocking among themselves with the scribes said, “He saved others. He
can’t save himself. <span class="bibleverse">32</span> Let the Christ,
the King of Israel, now come down from the cross, that we may see and
believe him.”<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>58</sup></a> Those who were crucified with him
also insulted him.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">33</span> When the sixth hour<a href="#fn59"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59" role="doc-noteref"><sup>59</sup></a>
had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.<a
href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>60</sup></a> <span class="bibleverse">34</span>
At the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, “Eloi, Eloi,
lama sabachthani?” which is, being interpreted, “My God, my God, why
have you forsaken me?” <a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">35</span> Some of those who stood by, when
they heard it, said, “Behold, he is calling Elijah.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">36</span> One ran, and filling a sponge full
of vinegar, put it on a reed and gave it to him to drink, saying, “Let
him be. Let’s see whether Elijah comes to take him down.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">37</span> Jesus cried out with a loud voice,
and gave up the spirit. <span class="bibleverse">38</span> The veil of
the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom. <span
class="bibleverse">39</span> When the centurion, who stood by opposite
him, saw that he cried out like this and breathed his last, he said,
“Truly this man was the Son of God!”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">40</span> There were also women watching
from afar, among whom were both Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of
James the less and of Joses, and Salome; <span
class="bibleverse">41</span> who, when he was in Galilee, followed him
and served him; and many other women who came up with him to
Jerusalem.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">42</span> When evening had now come, because
it was the Preparation Day, that is, the day before the Sabbath, <span
class="bibleverse">43</span> Joseph of Arimathaea, a prominent council
member who also himself was looking for God’s Kingdom, came. He boldly
went in to Pilate, and asked for Jesus’ body. <span
class="bibleverse">44</span> Pilate was surprised to hear that he was
already dead; and summoning the centurion, he asked him whether he had
been dead long. <span class="bibleverse">45</span> When he found out
from the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph. <span
class="bibleverse">46</span> He bought a linen cloth, and taking him
down, wound him in the linen cloth and laid him in a tomb which had been
cut out of a rock. He rolled a stone against the door of the tomb. <span
class="bibleverse">47</span> Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of
Joses, saw where he was laid.</p>
<h1 id="section-15">16</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> When the Sabbath was past, Mary
Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices, that
they might come and anoint him. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> Very
early on the first day of the week, they came to the tomb when the sun
had risen. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> They were saying among
themselves, “Who will roll away the stone from the door of the tomb for
us?” <span class="bibleverse">4</span> for it was very big. Looking up,
they saw that the stone was rolled back.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">5</span> Entering into the tomb, they saw a
young man sitting on the right side, dressed in a white robe; and they
were amazed. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> He said to them, “Don’t
be amazed. You seek Jesus, the Nazarene, who has been crucified. He has
risen! He is not here. See the place where they laid him! <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> But go, tell his disciples and Peter, ‘He
goes before you into Galilee. There you will see him, as he said to
you.’”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">8</span> They went out,<a href="#fn62"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62" role="doc-noteref"><sup>62</sup></a>
and fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had come on them.
They said nothing to anyone; for they were afraid.<a href="#fn63"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>63</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">9</span> <a href="#fn64"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64" role="doc-noteref"><sup>64</sup></a>
Now when he had risen early on the first day of the week, he appeared
first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> She went and told those who had been with
him, as they mourned and wept. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> When
they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her, they
disbelieved.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">12</span> After these things he was revealed
in another form to two of them as they walked, on their way into the
country. <span class="bibleverse">13</span> They went away and told it
to the rest. They didn’t believe them, either.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">14</span> Afterward he was revealed to the
eleven themselves as they sat at the table; and he rebuked them for
their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they didn’t believe those
who had seen him after he had risen. <span class="bibleverse">15</span>
He said to them, “Go into all the world and preach the Good News to the
whole creation. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> He who believes and
is baptized will be saved; but he who disbelieves will be condemned.
<span class="bibleverse">17</span> These signs will accompany those who
believe: in my name they will cast out demons; they will speak with new
languages; <span class="bibleverse">18</span> they will take up
