Prophet's lament for the dire conditions of his time and the depravity
of his people</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> The revelation which Habakkuk the
prophet saw. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> Yahweh,<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> how
long will I cry, and you will not hear? I cry out to you “Violence!” and
will you not save? <span class="bibleverse">3</span> Why do you show me
iniquity, and look at perversity? For destruction and violence are
before me. There is strife, and contention rises up. <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> Therefore the law is paralyzed, and justice
never prevails; for the wicked surround the righteous; therefore justice
comes out perverted.</p>
<h2
id="announcement-of-next-criminal-court-description-of-the-terrible-enemy-approaching">Announcement
of next criminal court; Description of the terrible enemy
approaching</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">5</span> “Look among the nations, watch, and
wonder marvelously; for I am working a work in your days which you will
not believe though it is told you. <span class="bibleverse">6</span>
For, behold,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> I am raising up the Chaldeans, that
bitter and hasty nation who march through the width of the earth, to
possess dwelling places that are not theirs. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> They are feared and dreaded. Their judgment
and their dignity proceed from themselves. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> Their horses also are swifter than leopards,
and are more fierce than the evening wolves. Their horsemen press
proudly on. Yes, their horsemen come from afar. They fly as an eagle
that hurries to devour. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> All of them
come for violence. Their hordes face forward. They gather prisoners like
sand. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> Yes, they scoff at kings, and
princes are a derision to them. They laugh at every stronghold, for they
build up an earthen ramp and take it. <span class="bibleverse">11</span>
Then they sweep by like the wind and go on. They are indeed guilty,
whose strength is their god.”</p>
<h2
id="the-prophet-reproachfully-asked-god-why-he-would-allow-the-enemy-to-do-such-a-terrible-thing">The
prophet reproachfully asked God why he would allow the enemy to do such
a terrible thing</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">12</span> Aren’t you from everlasting,
Yahweh my God,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> my Holy One? We will not die.
Yahweh, you have appointed them for judgment. You, Rock, have
established him to punish. <span class="bibleverse">13</span> You who
have purer eyes than to see evil, and who cannot look on perversity, why
do you tolerate those who deal treacherously and keep silent when the
wicked swallows up the man who is more righteous than he, <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> and make men like the fish of the sea, like
the creeping things that have no ruler over them? <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> He takes up all of them with the hook. He
catches them in his net and gathers them in his dragnet. Therefore he
rejoices and is glad. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> Therefore he
sacrifices to his net and burns incense to his dragnet, because by them
his life is luxurious and his food is good. <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> Will he therefore continually empty his
net, and kill the nations without mercy?</p>
<h1 id="section-1">2</h1>
<h2
id="habakkuk-awaits-and-receives-gods-answer-to-his-complaint">Habakkuk
awaits and receives God's answer to his complaint</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> I will stand at my watch and set
myself on the ramparts, and will look out to see what he will say to me,
and what I will answer concerning my complaint. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> Yahweh answered me, “Write the vision, and
make it plain on tablets, that he who runs may read it. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> For the vision is yet for the appointed
time, and it hurries toward the end, and won’t prove false. Though it
takes time, wait for it, because it will surely come. It won’t delay.
<span class="bibleverse">4</span> Behold, his soul is puffed up. It is
not upright in him, but the righteous will live by his faith.</p>
<h2
id="gods-real-revelation-against-the-savage-conqueror-in-five-woes">God's
real revelation against the savage conqueror in five woes</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">5</span> Yes, moreover, wine is treacherous:
an arrogant man who doesn’t stay at home, who enlarges his desire as
Sheol;<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> he is like death and can’t be
satisfied, but gathers to himself all nations and heaps to himself all
peoples. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> Won’t all these take up a
parable against him, and a taunting proverb against him, and say, ‘Woe
to him who increases that which is not his, and who enriches himself by
extortion! How long?’ <span class="bibleverse">7</span> Won’t your
debtors rise up suddenly, and wake up those who make you tremble, and
you will be their victim? <span class="bibleverse">8</span> Because you
have plundered many nations, all the remnant of the peoples will plunder
you because of men’s blood, and for the violence done to the land, to
the city and to all who dwell in it. <span class="bibleverse">9</span>
Woe to him who gets an evil gain for his house, that he may set his nest
on high, that he may be delivered from the hand of evil! <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> You have devised shame to your house by
cutting off many peoples, and have sinned against your soul. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> For the stone will cry out of the wall, and
the beam out of the woodwork will answer it. <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> Woe to him who builds a town with blood,
and establishes a city by iniquity! <span class="bibleverse">13</span>
Behold, isn’t it from Yahweh of Armies that the peoples labor for the
fire, and the nations weary themselves for vanity? <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> For the earth will be filled with the
knowledge of Yahweh’s glory, as the waters cover the sea. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> “Woe to him who gives his neighbor drink,
pouring your inflaming wine until they are drunk, so that you may gaze
at their naked bodies! <span class="bibleverse">16</span> You are filled
with shame, and not glory. You will also drink and be exposed! The cup
of Yahweh’s right hand will come around to you, and disgrace will cover
your glory. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> For the violence done to
Lebanon will overwhelm you, and the destruction of the animals will
terrify you, because of men’s blood and for the violence done to the
land, to every city and to those who dwell in them. <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> “What value does the engraved image have,
that its maker has engraved it; the molten image, even the teacher of
lies, that he who fashions its form trusts in it, to make mute idols?
<span class="bibleverse">19</span> Woe to him who says to the wood,
‘Awake!’ or to the mute stone, ‘Arise!’ Shall this teach? Behold, it is
overlaid with gold and silver, and there is no breath at all within it.
<span class="bibleverse">20</span> But Yahweh is in his holy temple. Let
all the earth be silent before him!”</p>
<h1 id="section-2">3</h1>
<h2 id="song-to-the-appearance-of-the-lord-in-judgment">Song to the
appearance of the Lord in judgment</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> A prayer of Habakkuk, the prophet,
set to victorious music. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> Yahweh, I
have heard of your fame. I stand in awe of your deeds, Yahweh. Renew
your work in the middle of the years. In the middle of the years make it
known. In wrath, you remember mercy. <span class="bibleverse">3</span>
God came from Teman, the Holy One from Mount Paran. Selah. His glory
covered the heavens, and his praise filled the earth. <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> His splendor is like the sunrise. Rays shine
from his hand, where his power is hidden. <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> Plague went before him, and pestilence
followed his feet. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> He stood, and shook
the earth. He looked, and made the nations tremble. The ancient
mountains were crumbled. The age-old hills collapsed. His ways are
eternal. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> I saw the tents of Cushan in
affliction. The dwellings of the land of Midian trembled. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> Was Yahweh displeased with the rivers? Was
your anger against the rivers, or your wrath against the sea, that you
rode on your horses, on your chariots of salvation? <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> You uncovered your bow. You called for your
sworn arrows. Selah. You split the earth with rivers. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> The mountains saw you, and were afraid. The
storm of waters passed by. The deep roared and lifted up its hands on
high. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> The sun and moon stood still in
the sky at the light of your arrows as they went, at the shining of your
glittering spear. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> You marched through
the land in wrath. You threshed the nations in anger. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> You went out for the salvation of your
people, for the salvation of your anointed. You crushed the head of the
land of wickedness. You stripped them head to foot. Selah. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> You pierced the heads of his warriors with
their own spears. They came as a whirlwind to scatter me, gloating as if
to devour the wretched in secret. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> You
trampled the sea with your horses, churning mighty waters.</p>
<h2
id="terrifying-and-at-the-same-time-encouraging-effect-of-the-appearance-of-god-in-the-prophet">Terrifying
and at the same time encouraging effect of the appearance of God in the
prophet</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">16</span> I heard, and my body trembled. My
lips quivered at the voice. Rottenness enters into my bones, and I
tremble in my place because I must wait quietly for the day of trouble,
for the coming up of the people who invade us. <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> For even though the fig tree doesn’t
flourish, nor fruit be in the vines, the labor of the olive fails, the
fields yield no food, the flocks are cut off from the fold, and there is
no herd in the stalls, <span class="bibleverse">18</span> yet I will
rejoice in Yahweh. I will be joyful in the God of my salvation! <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> Yahweh, the Lord,<a href="#fn5"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> is
my strength. He makes my feet like deer’s feet, and enables me to go in
high places. For the music director, on my stringed instruments.</p>
