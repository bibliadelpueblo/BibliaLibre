the desert</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> These are the words which Moses
spoke to all Israel beyond the Jordan in the wilderness, in the Arabah
opposite Suf, between Paran, Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Dizahab. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> It is eleven days’ journey from Horeb by the
way of Mount Seir to Kadesh Barnea. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> In
the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month,
Moses spoke to the children of Israel according to all that Yahweh<a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> had given him in commandment to
them, <span class="bibleverse">4</span> after he had struck Sihon the
king of the Amorites who lived in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan who
lived in Ashtaroth, at Edrei. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> Beyond
the Jordan, in the land of Moab, Moses began to declare this law,
saying,</p>
<h2 id="gods-command-to-leave-horeb-sinai">God's command to leave Horeb
(Sinai)</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">6</span> “Yahweh our God<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>
spoke to us in Horeb, saying, ‘You have lived long enough at this
mountain. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> Turn, and take your journey,
and go to the hill country of the Amorites and to all the places near
there: in the Arabah, in the hill country, in the lowland, in the South,
by the seashore, in the land of the Canaanites, and in Lebanon as far as
the great river, the river Euphrates. <span class="bibleverse">8</span>
Behold,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> I have set the land before you. Go
in and possess the land which Yahweh swore to your fathers—to Abraham,
to Isaac, and to Jacob—to give to them and to their offspring<a

<h2 id="appointment-of-leaders-and-presidents-to-help-moses">Appointment
of leaders and presidents to help Moses</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">9</span> I spoke to you at that time,
saying, “I am not able to bear you myself alone. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> Yahweh your God has multiplied you, and
behold, you are today as the stars of the sky for multitude. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> May Yahweh, the God of your fathers, make
you a thousand times as many as you are and bless you, as he has
promised you! <span class="bibleverse">12</span> How can I myself alone
bear your problems, your burdens, and your strife? <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> Take wise men of understanding who are
respected among your tribes, and I will make them heads over you.” <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> You answered me, and said, “The thing which
you have spoken is good to do.” <span class="bibleverse">15</span> So I
took the heads of your tribes, wise and respected men, and made them
heads over you, captains of thousands, captains of hundreds, captains of
fifties, captains of tens, and officers, according to your tribes. <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> I commanded your judges at that time,
saying, “Hear cases between your brothers and judge righteously between
a man and his brother, and the foreigner who is living with him. <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> You shall not show partiality in judgment;
you shall hear the small and the great alike. You shall not be afraid of
the face of man, for the judgment is God’s. The case that is too hard
for you, you shall bring to me, and I will hear it.” <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> I commanded you at that time all the things
which you should do.</p>

from Horeb to Kades-Barnea; Discouragement and disbelief of the people
after sending the spies</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">19</span> We traveled from Horeb and went
through all that great and terrible wilderness which you saw, by the way
to the hill country of the Amorites, as Yahweh our God commanded us; and
we came to Kadesh Barnea. <span class="bibleverse">20</span> I said to
you, “You have come to the hill country of the Amorites, which Yahweh
our God gives to us. <span class="bibleverse">21</span> Behold, Yahweh
your God has set the land before you. Go up, take possession, as Yahweh
the God of your fathers has spoken to you. Don’t be afraid, neither be
dismayed.” <span class="bibleverse">22</span> You came near to me,
everyone of you, and said, “Let’s send men before us, that they may
search the land for us, and bring back to us word of the way by which we
must go up, and the cities to which we shall come.” <span
class="bibleverse">23</span> The thing pleased me well. I took twelve of
your men, one man for every tribe. <span class="bibleverse">24</span>
They turned and went up into the hill country, and came to the valley of
Eshcol, and spied it out. <span class="bibleverse">25</span> They took
some of the fruit of the land in their hands and brought it down to us,
and brought us word again, and said, “It is a good land which Yahweh our
God gives to us.” <span class="bibleverse">26</span> Yet you wouldn’t go
up, but rebelled against the commandment of Yahweh your God. <span
class="bibleverse">27</span> You murmured in your tents, and said,
“Because Yahweh hated us, he has brought us out of the land of Egypt, to
deliver us into the hand of the Amorites to destroy us. <span
class="bibleverse">28</span> Where are we going up? Our brothers have
made our heart melt, saying, ‘The people are greater and taller than we.
The cities are great and fortified up to the sky. Moreover we have seen
the sons of the Anakim there!’”</p>
<h2 id="unsuccessful-attempt-to-cheer-up-moses">Unsuccessful attempt to

<p><span class="bibleverse">29</span> Then I said to you, “Don’t be
terrified. Don’t be afraid of them. <span class="bibleverse">30</span>
Yahweh your God, who goes before you, he will fight for you, according
to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes, <span
class="bibleverse">31</span> and in the wilderness where you have seen
how that Yahweh your God carried you, as a man carries his son, in all
the way that you went, until you came to this place.” <span
class="bibleverse">32</span> Yet in this thing you didn’t believe Yahweh
your God, <span class="bibleverse">33</span> who went before you on the
way, to seek out a place for you to pitch your tents in: in fire by
night, to show you by what way you should go, and in the cloud by
day.</p>

divine judgment; Repentance of the people; Failure of unauthorized
conquest attempt</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">34</span> Yahweh heard the voice of your
words and was angry, and swore, saying, <span
class="bibleverse">35</span> “Surely not one of these men of this evil
generation shall see the good land which I swore to give to your
fathers, <span class="bibleverse">36</span> except Caleb the son of
Jephunneh. He shall see it. I will give the land that he has trodden on
to him and to his children, because he has wholly followed Yahweh.”
<span class="bibleverse">37</span> Also Yahweh was angry with me for
your sakes, saying, “You also shall not go in there. <span
class="bibleverse">38</span> Joshua the son of Nun, who stands before
you, shall go in there. Encourage him, for he shall cause Israel to
inherit it. <span class="bibleverse">39</span> Moreover your little
ones, whom you said would be captured or killed, your children, who
today have no knowledge of good or evil, shall go in there. I will give
it to them, and they shall possess it. <span
class="bibleverse">40</span> But as for you, turn, and take your journey
into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea.” <span
class="bibleverse">41</span> Then you answered and said to me, “We have
sinned against Yahweh. We will go up and fight, according to all that
Yahweh our God commanded us.” Every man of you put on his weapons of
war, and presumed to go up into the hill country. <span
class="bibleverse">42</span> Yahweh said to me, “Tell them, ‘Don’t go up
and don’t fight; for I am not among you, lest you be struck before your
enemies.’” <span class="bibleverse">43</span> So I spoke to you, and you
didn’t listen; but you rebelled against the commandment of Yahweh, and
were presumptuous, and went up into the hill country. <span
class="bibleverse">44</span> The Amorites, who lived in that hill
country, came out against you and chased you as bees do, and beat you
down in Seir, even to Hormah. <span class="bibleverse">45</span> You
returned and wept before Yahweh, but Yahweh didn’t listen to your voice,
nor turn his ear to you. <span class="bibleverse">46</span> So you
stayed in Kadesh many days, according to the days that you remained.</p>

back on the peaceful journey through the land of the Edomites and
Moabites; Ban on attacking the Ammonites; Defeat of the Amorite king
Sehon</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Then we turned, and took our
journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea, as Yahweh spoke
to me; and we encircled Mount Seir many days. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> Yahweh spoke to me, saying, <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> “You have encircled this mountain long
enough. Turn northward. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> Command the
people, saying, ‘You are to pass through the border of your brothers,
the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir; and they will be afraid of you.
Therefore be careful. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> Don’t contend
with them; for I will not give you any of their land, no, not so much as
for the sole of the foot to tread on, because I have given Mount Seir to
Esau for a possession. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> You shall
purchase food from them for money, that you may eat. You shall also buy
water from them for money, that you may drink.’” <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> For Yahweh your God has blessed you in all
the work of your hands. He has known your walking through this great
wilderness. These forty years, Yahweh your God has been with you. You
have lacked nothing. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> So we passed by
from our brothers, the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir, from the way
of the Arabah from Elath and from Ezion Geber. We turned and passed by
the way of the wilderness of Moab. <span class="bibleverse">9</span>
Yahweh said to me, “Don’t bother Moab, neither contend with them in
battle; for I will not give you any of his land for a possession,
because I have given Ar to the children of Lot for a possession.” <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> (The Emim lived there before, a great and
numerous people, and tall as the Anakim. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> These also are considered to be Rephaim, as
the Anakim; but the Moabites call them Emim. <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> The Horites also lived in Seir in the past,
but the children of Esau succeeded them. They destroyed them from before
them, and lived in their place, as Israel did to the land of his
possession, which Yahweh gave to them.) <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> “Now rise up and cross over the brook
Zered.” We went over the brook Zered. <span class="bibleverse">14</span>
The days in which we came from Kadesh Barnea until we had come over the
brook Zered were thirty-eight years, until all the generation of the men
of war were consumed from the middle of the camp, as Yahweh swore to
them. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> Moreover Yahweh’s hand was
against them, to destroy them from the middle of the camp, until they
were consumed. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> So, when all the men
of war were consumed and dead from among the people, <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> Yahweh spoke to me, saying, <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> “You are to pass over Ar, the border of
Moab, today. <span class="bibleverse">19</span> When you come near the
border of the children of Ammon, don’t bother them, nor contend with
them; for I will not give you any of the land of the children of Ammon
for a possession, because I have given it to the children of Lot for a
possession.” <span class="bibleverse">20</span> (That also is considered
a land of Rephaim. Rephaim lived there in the past, but the Ammonites
call them Zamzummim, <span class="bibleverse">21</span> a great people,
many, and tall, as the Anakim; but Yahweh destroyed them from before
Israel, and they succeeded them, and lived in their place, <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> as he did for the children of Esau who
dwell in Seir, when he destroyed the Horites from before them; and they
succeeded them, and lived in their place even to this day. <span
class="bibleverse">23</span> Then the Avvim, who lived in villages as
far as Gaza: the Caphtorim, who came out of Caphtor, destroyed them and
lived in their place.) <span class="bibleverse">24</span> “Rise up, take
your journey, and pass over the valley of the Arnon. Behold, I have
given into your hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land;
begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle. <span
class="bibleverse">25</span> Today I will begin to put the dread of you
and the fear of you on the peoples who are under the whole sky, who
shall hear the report of you, and shall tremble and be in anguish
because of you.”</p>
<h2
id="defeat-of-the-amorite-king-sehon-and-conquest-of-his-empire">Defeat
of the Amorite king Sehon and conquest of his empire</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">26</span> I sent messengers out of the
wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace,
saying, <span class="bibleverse">27</span> “Let me pass through your
land. I will go along by the highway. I will turn neither to the right
hand nor to the left. <span class="bibleverse">28</span> You shall sell
me food for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I
may drink. Just let me pass through on my feet, <span
class="bibleverse">29</span> as the children of Esau who dwell in Seir,
and the Moabites who dwell in Ar, did to me, until I pass over the
Jordan into the land which Yahweh our God gives us.” <span
class="bibleverse">30</span> But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us
pass by him, for Yahweh your God hardened his spirit and made his heart
obstinate, that he might deliver him into your hand, as it is today.
<span class="bibleverse">31</span> Yahweh said to me, “Behold, I have
begun to deliver up Sihon and his land before you. Begin to possess,
that you may inherit his land.” <span class="bibleverse">32</span> Then
Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Jahaz.
<span class="bibleverse">33</span> Yahweh our God delivered him up
before us; and we struck him, his sons, and all his people. <span
class="bibleverse">34</span> We took all his cities at that time, and
utterly destroyed every inhabited city, with the women and the little
ones. We left no one remaining. <span class="bibleverse">35</span> Only
the livestock we took for plunder for ourselves, with the plunder of the
cities which we had taken. <span class="bibleverse">36</span> From
Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and the city
that is in the valley, even to Gilead, there was not a city too high for
us. Yahweh our God delivered up all before us. <span
class="bibleverse">37</span> Only to the land of the children of Ammon
you didn’t come near: all the banks of the river Jabbok, and the cities
of the hill country, and wherever Yahweh our God forbade us.</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Then we turned, and went up the way
to Bashan. Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his
people, to battle at Edrei. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> Yahweh
said to me, “Don’t fear him; for I have delivered him, with all his
people and his land, into your hand. You shall do to him as you did to
Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon.” <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> So Yahweh our God also delivered into our
hand Og, the king of Bashan, and all his people. We struck him until no
one was left to him remaining. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> We took
all his cities at that time. There was not a city which we didn’t take
from them: sixty cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in
Bashan. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> All these were cities
fortified with high walls, gates, and bars, in addition to a great many
villages without walls. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> We utterly
destroyed them, as we did to Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying
every inhabited city, with the women and the little ones. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> But all the livestock, and the plunder of
the cities, we took for plunder for ourselves.</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">8</span> We took the land at that time out
of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan,
from the valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> (The Sidonians call Hermon Sirion, and the
Amorites call it Senir.) <span class="bibleverse">10</span> We took all
the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, to Salecah and
Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> (For only Og king of Bashan remained of the
remnant of the Rephaim. Behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron.
Isn’t it in Rabbah of the children of Ammon? Nine cubits<a href="#fn5"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> was
its length, and four cubits its width, after the cubit of a man.) <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> This land we took in possession at that
time: from Aroer, which is by the valley of the Arnon, and half the hill
country of Gilead with its cities, I gave to the Reubenites and to the
Gadites; <span class="bibleverse">13</span> and the rest of Gilead, and
all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh—all
the region of Argob, even all Bashan. (The same is called the land of
Rephaim. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> Jair the son of Manasseh
took all the region of Argob, to the border of the Geshurites and the
Maacathites, and called them, even Bashan, after his own name, Havvoth
Jair, to this day.) <span class="bibleverse">15</span> I gave Gilead to
Machir. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> To the Reubenites and to the
Gadites I gave from Gilead even to the valley of the Arnon, the middle
of the valley, and its border, even to the river Jabbok, which is the
border of the children of Ammon; <span class="bibleverse">17</span> the
Arabah also, and the Jordan and its border, from Chinnereth even to the
sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, under the slopes of Pisgah
eastward.</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">18</span> I commanded you at that time,
saying, “Yahweh your God has given you this land to possess it. All of
you men of valor shall pass over armed before your brothers, the
children of Israel. <span class="bibleverse">19</span> But your wives,
and your little ones, and your livestock, (I know that you have much
livestock), shall live in your cities which I have given you, <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> until Yahweh gives rest to your brothers,
as to you, and they also possess the land which Yahweh your God gives
them beyond the Jordan. Then you shall each return to his own
possession, which I have given you.” <span class="bibleverse">21</span>
I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, “Your eyes have seen all that
Yahweh your God has done to these two kings. So shall Yahweh do to all
the kingdoms where you go over. <span class="bibleverse">22</span> You
shall not fear them; for Yahweh your God himself fights for you.”</p>

Yahweh, you have begun to show your servant your greatness, and your
strong hand. For what god is there in heaven or in earth that can do
works like yours, and mighty acts like yours? <span
class="bibleverse">25</span> Please let me go over and see the good land
that is beyond the Jordan, that fine mountain, and Lebanon.” <span
class="bibleverse">26</span> But Yahweh was angry with me because of
you, and didn’t listen to me. Yahweh said to me, “That is enough! Speak
no more to me of this matter. <span class="bibleverse">27</span> Go up
to the top of Pisgah, and lift up your eyes westward, and northward, and
southward, and eastward, and see with your eyes; for you shall not go
over this Jordan. <span class="bibleverse">28</span> But commission
Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him; for he shall go over
before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which
you shall see.” <span class="bibleverse">29</span> So we stayed in the

and go in and possess the land which Yahweh, the God of your fathers,
gives you. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> You shall not add to the
word which I command you, neither shall you take away from it, that you
may keep the commandments of Yahweh your God which I command you. <span

of Baal Peor; for Yahweh your God has destroyed all the men who followed
Baal Peor from among you. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> But you who
were faithful to Yahweh your God are all alive today. <span

wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the peoples who shall hear
all these statutes and say, “Surely this great nation is a wise and

<p><span class="bibleverse">9</span> Only be careful, and keep your soul
diligently, lest you forget the things which your eyes saw, and lest
they depart from your heart all the days of your life; but make them
known to your children and your children’s children— <span

God in Horeb, when Yahweh said to me, “Assemble the people to me, and I
will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the
days that they live on the earth, and that they may teach their
children.” <span class="bibleverse">11</span> You came near and stood
under the mountain. The mountain burned with fire to the heart of the
sky, with darkness, cloud, and thick darkness. <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> Yahweh spoke to you out of the middle of
the fire: you heard the voice of words, but you saw no form; you only
heard a voice. <span class="bibleverse">13</span> He declared to you his
covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even the ten commandments.
He wrote them on two stone tablets. <span class="bibleverse">14</span>
Yahweh commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and ordinances,
that you might do them in the land where you go over to possess it.
<span class="bibleverse">15</span> Be very careful, for you saw no kind
of form on the day that Yahweh spoke to you in Horeb out of the middle
of the fire, <span class="bibleverse">16</span> lest you corrupt
yourselves, and make yourself a carved image in the form of any figure,
the likeness of male or female, <span class="bibleverse">17</span> the
likeness of any animal that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged
bird that flies in the sky, <span class="bibleverse">18</span> the
likeness of anything that creeps on the ground, the likeness of any fish
that is in the water under the earth; <span class="bibleverse">19</span>
and lest you lift up your eyes to the sky, and when you see the sun and
the moon and the stars, even all the army of the sky, you are drawn away
and worship them, and serve them, which Yahweh your God has allotted to
all the peoples under the whole sky. <span class="bibleverse">20</span>
But Yahweh has taken you, and brought you out of the iron furnace, out
of Egypt, to be to him a people of inheritance, as it is today. <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> Furthermore Yahweh was angry with me for
your sakes, and swore that I should not go over the Jordan, and that I
should not go in to that good land which Yahweh your God gives you for
an inheritance; <span class="bibleverse">22</span> but I must die in
this land. I must not go over the Jordan, but you shall go over and
possess that good land. <span class="bibleverse">23</span> Be careful,
lest you forget the covenant of Yahweh your God, which he made with you,
and make yourselves a carved image in the form of anything which Yahweh
your God has forbidden you. <span class="bibleverse">24</span> For
Yahweh your God is a devouring fire, a jealous God.</p>

your God and listen to his voice. <span class="bibleverse">31</span> For

<p><span class="bibleverse">32</span> For ask now of the days that are
past, which were before you, since the day that God created man on the
earth, and from the one end of the sky to the other, whether there has
been anything as great as this thing is, or has been heard like it?
<span class="bibleverse">33</span> Did a people ever hear the voice of
God speaking out of the middle of the fire, as you have heard, and live?
<span class="bibleverse">34</span> Or has God tried to go and take a
nation for himself from among another nation, by trials, by signs, by
wonders, by war, by a mighty hand, by an outstretched arm, and by great
terrors, according to all that Yahweh your God did for you in Egypt
before your eyes? <span class="bibleverse">35</span> It was shown to you
so that you might know that Yahweh is God. There is no one else besides
him. <span class="bibleverse">36</span> Out of heaven he made you to
hear his voice, that he might instruct you. On earth he made you to see
his great fire; and you heard his words out of the middle of the fire.
<span class="bibleverse">37</span> Because he loved your fathers,
therefore he chose their offspring after them, and brought you out with
his presence, with his great power, out of Egypt; <span
class="bibleverse">38</span> to drive out nations from before you
greater and mightier than you, to bring you in, to give you their land
for an inheritance, as it is today. <span class="bibleverse">39</span>
Know therefore today, and take it to heart, that Yahweh himself is God
in heaven above and on the earth beneath. There is no one else. <span

commandments which I command you today, that it may go well with you and
with your children after you, and that you may prolong your days in the

class="bibleverse">15</span> So I turned and came down from the
mountain, and the mountain was burning with fire. The two tablets of the
covenant were in my two hands. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> I
looked, and behold, you had sinned against Yahweh your God. You had made
yourselves a molded calf. You had quickly turned away from the way which
Yahweh had commanded you. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> I took hold
of the two tablets, and threw them out of my two hands, and broke them
before your eyes. <span class="bibleverse">18</span> I fell down before
Yahweh, as at the first, forty days and forty nights. I neither ate
bread nor drank water, because of all your sin which you sinned, in
doing that which was evil in Yahweh’s sight, to provoke him to anger.
<span class="bibleverse">19</span> For I was afraid of the anger and hot
displeasure with which Yahweh was angry against you to destroy you. But
Yahweh listened to me that time also. <span class="bibleverse">20</span>
Yahweh was angry enough with Aaron to destroy him. I prayed for Aaron
also at the same time. <span class="bibleverse">21</span> I took your
sin, the calf which you had made, and burned it with fire, and crushed
it, grinding it very small, until it was as fine as dust. I threw its
dust into the brook that descended out of the mountain.</p>
<h2 id="another-evidence-of-popular-disobedience">Another evidence of
popular disobedience</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">22</span> At Taberah, at Massah, and at
Kibroth Hattaavah you provoked Yahweh to wrath. <span
class="bibleverse">23</span> When Yahweh sent you from Kadesh Barnea,
saying, “Go up and possess the land which I have given you,” you
rebelled against the commandment of Yahweh your God, and you didn’t
believe him or listen to his voice. <span class="bibleverse">24</span>
You have been rebellious against Yahweh from the day that I knew
you.</p>

that time, the destruction of Israel was averted only through the

<p><span class="bibleverse">25</span> So I fell down before Yahweh the
forty days and forty nights that I fell down, because Yahweh had said he
would destroy you. <span class="bibleverse">26</span> I prayed to
Yahweh, and said, “Lord Yahweh, don’t destroy your people and your
inheritance that you have redeemed through your greatness, that you have
brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand. <span
class="bibleverse">27</span> Remember your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob. Don’t look at the stubbornness of this people, nor at their
wickedness, nor at their sin, <span class="bibleverse">28</span> lest
the land you brought us out from say, ‘Because Yahweh was not able to
bring them into the land which he promised to them, and because he hated
them, he has brought them out to kill them in the wilderness.’ <span
class="bibleverse">29</span> Yet they are your people and your
inheritance, which you brought out by your great power and by your
outstretched arm.”</p>
<h1 id="section-9">10</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> At that time Yahweh said to me,
“Cut two stone tablets like the first, and come up to me onto the
mountain, and make an ark of wood. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> I
will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets which
you broke, and you shall put them in the ark.” <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> So I made an ark of acacia wood, and cut two
stone tablets like the first, and went up onto the mountain, having the
two tablets in my hand. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> He wrote on
the tablets, according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which
Yahweh spoke to you on the mountain out of the middle of the fire in the
day of the assembly; and Yahweh gave them to me. <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> I turned and came down from the mountain,
and put the tablets in the ark which I had made; and there they are as
Yahweh commanded me. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> (The children of
Israel traveled from Beeroth Bene Jaakan to Moserah. There Aaron died,
and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest’s
office in his place. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> From there they
traveled to Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land of brooks
of water. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> At that time Yahweh set
apart the tribe of Levi to bear the ark of Yahweh’s covenant, to stand
before Yahweh to minister to him, and to bless in his name, to this day.
<span class="bibleverse">9</span> Therefore Levi has no portion nor
inheritance with his brothers; Yahweh is his inheritance, according as
Yahweh your God spoke to him.) <span class="bibleverse">10</span> I
stayed on the mountain, as at the first time, forty days and forty
nights; and Yahweh listened to me that time also. Yahweh would not
destroy you. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> Yahweh said to me,
“Arise, take your journey before the people; and they shall go in and
possess the land which I swore to their fathers to give to them.”</p>

<span class="bibleverse">15</span> Only Yahweh had a delight in your

above all peoples, as it is today. <span class="bibleverse">16</span>
Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more
stiff-necked. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> For Yahweh your God, he
is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great God, the mighty, and the
awesome, who doesn’t respect persons or take bribes. <span

widow and loves the foreigner in giving him food and clothing. <span

thirst, in nakedness, and in lack of all things. He will put an iron
yoke on your neck until he has destroyed you. <span

far away, from the end of the earth, as the eagle flies: a nation whose

nor show favor to the young. <span class="bibleverse">51</span> They

increase of your livestock, or the young of your flock, until they have

besiege you in all your gates until your high and fortified walls in
which you trusted come down throughout all your land. They will besiege
you in all your gates throughout all your land which Yahweh your God has
given you. <span class="bibleverse">53</span> You will eat the fruit of
your own body, the flesh of your sons and of your daughters, whom Yahweh
your God has given you, in the siege and in the distress with which your
enemies will distress you. <span class="bibleverse">54</span> The man
who is tender among you, and very delicate, his eye will be evil toward
his brother, toward the wife whom he loves, and toward the remnant of
his children whom he has remaining, <span class="bibleverse">55</span>
so that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children
whom he will eat, because he has nothing left to him, in the siege and
in the distress with which your enemy will distress you in all your
gates. <span class="bibleverse">56</span> The tender and delicate woman
among you, who would not venture to set the sole of her foot on the
ground for delicateness and tenderness, her eye will be evil toward the
husband that she loves, toward her son, toward her daughter, <span
class="bibleverse">57</span> toward her young one who comes out from
between her feet, and toward her children whom she bears; for she will
eat them secretly for lack of all things in the siege and in the
distress with which your enemy will distress you in your gates. <span
class="bibleverse">58</span> If you will not observe to do all the words
of this law that are written in this book, that you may fear this
glorious and fearful name, YAHWEH your God, <span
class="bibleverse">59</span> then Yahweh will make your plagues and the
plagues of your offspring fearful, even great plagues, and of long
duration, and severe sicknesses, and of long duration. <span
class="bibleverse">60</span> He will bring on you again all the diseases
of Egypt, which you were afraid of; and they will cling to you. <span
class="bibleverse">61</span> Also every sickness and every plague which
is not written in the book of this law, Yahweh will bring them on you
until you are destroyed. <span class="bibleverse">62</span> You will be
left few in number, even though you were as the stars of the sky for
multitude, because you didn’t listen to Yahweh your God’s voice. <span
class="bibleverse">63</span> It will happen that as Yahweh rejoiced over
you to do you good, and to multiply you, so Yahweh will rejoice over you
to cause you to perish and to destroy you. You will be plucked from the
land that you are going in to possess. <span
class="bibleverse">64</span> Yahweh will scatter you among all peoples,
from one end of the earth to the other end of the earth. There you will
serve other gods which you have not known, you nor your fathers, even
wood and stone. <span class="bibleverse">65</span> Among these nations
you will find no ease, and there will be no rest for the sole of your
foot; but Yahweh will give you there a trembling heart, failing of eyes,
and pining of soul. <span class="bibleverse">66</span> Your life will
hang in doubt before you. You will be afraid night and day, and will
have no assurance of your life. <span class="bibleverse">67</span> In
the morning you will say, “I wish it were evening!” and at evening you
will say, “I wish it were morning!” for the fear of your heart which you
will fear, and for the sights which your eyes will see. <span
class="bibleverse">68</span> Yahweh will bring you into Egypt again with
ships, by the way of which I told to you that you would never see it
again. There you will offer yourselves to your enemies for male and
female slaves, and nobody will buy you.</p>

your sandals have not grown old on your feet. <span

lest there should be among you a root that produces bitter poison; <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> and it happen, when he hears the words of
this curse, that he bless himself in his heart, saying, “I shall have
peace, though I walk in the stubbornness of my heart,” to destroy the
moist with the dry. <span class="bibleverse">20</span> Yahweh will not
pardon him, but then Yahweh’s anger and his jealousy will smoke against
that man, and all the curse that is written in this book will fall on
him, and Yahweh will blot out his name from under the sky. <span

all the tribes of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant
written in this book of the law. <span class="bibleverse">22</span> The
generation to come—your children who will rise up after you, and the
foreigner who will come from a far land—will say, when they see the
plagues of that land, and the sicknesses with which Yahweh has made it
sick, <span class="bibleverse">23</span> that all of its land is sulfur,
salt, and burning, that it is not sown, doesn’t produce, nor does any
grass grow in it, like the overthrow of Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and
Zeboiim, which Yahweh overthrew in his anger, and in his wrath. <span
class="bibleverse">24</span> Even all the nations will say, “Why has
Yahweh done this to this land? What does the heat of this great anger
mean?” <span class="bibleverse">25</span> Then men will say, “Because
they abandoned the covenant of Yahweh, the God of their fathers, which
he made with them when he brought them out of the land of Egypt, <span
class="bibleverse">26</span> and went and served other gods and
worshiped them, gods that they didn’t know and that he had not given to
them. <span class="bibleverse">27</span> Therefore Yahweh’s anger burned
against this land, to bring on it all the curses that are written in
this book. <span class="bibleverse">28</span> Yahweh rooted them out of
their land in anger, in wrath, and in great indignation, and thrust them
into another land, as it is today.” <span class="bibleverse">29</span>

and the little ones, and the foreigners who are within your gates, that
they may hear, learn, fear Yahweh your God, and observe to do all the
words of this law, <span class="bibleverse">13</span> and that their
children, who have not known, may hear and learn to fear Yahweh your
God, as long as you live in the land where you go over the Jordan to
possess it.”</p>
<h2
id="god-announced-the-death-of-moses-foretold-the-future-apostasy-of-israel-and-commanded-that-a-song-be-written-as-a-testimony">God
announced the death of Moses, foretold the future apostasy of Israel,
and commanded that a song be written as a testimony</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">14</span> Yahweh said to Moses, “Behold,
your days approach that you must die. Call Joshua, and present
yourselves in the Tent of Meeting, that I may commission him.” Moses and
Joshua went, and presented themselves in the Tent of Meeting. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> Yahweh appeared in the Tent in a pillar of
cloud, and the pillar of cloud stood over the Tent’s door. <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> Yahweh said to Moses, “Behold, you shall
sleep with your fathers. This people will rise up and play the
prostitute after the strange gods of the land where they go to be among
them, and will forsake me and break my covenant which I have made with
them. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> Then my anger shall be kindled
against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide my
face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles
shall come on them; so that they will say in that day, ‘Haven’t these
evils come on us because our God is not among us?’ <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> I will surely hide my face in that day for
all the evil which they have done, in that they have turned to other
gods.</p>
<h2
id="gods-command-to-moses-to-write-the-song-moses-fulfills-the-mandate">God's
command to Moses to write the song; Moses fulfills the mandate</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">19</span> “Now therefore write this song for
yourselves, and teach it to the children of Israel. Put it in their
mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the children of
Israel. <span class="bibleverse">20</span> For when I have brought them
into the land which I swore to their fathers, flowing with milk and
honey, and they have eaten and filled themselves, and grown fat, then
they will turn to other gods, and serve them, and despise me, and break
my covenant. <span class="bibleverse">21</span> It will happen, when
many evils and troubles have come on them, that this song will testify
before them as a witness; for it will not be forgotten out of the mouths
of their descendants; for I know their ways and what they are doing
today, before I have brought them into the land which I promised them.”
<span class="bibleverse">22</span> So Moses wrote this song the same
day, and taught it to the children of Israel. <span
class="bibleverse">23</span> He commissioned Joshua the son of Nun, and
said, “Be strong and courageous; for you shall bring the children of
Israel into the land which I swore to them. I will be with you.”</p>

gives the book of the law to the Levites for safe keeping and reads his
song to the people as a final warning</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">24</span> When Moses had finished writing
the words of this law in a book, until they were finished, <span
class="bibleverse">25</span> Moses commanded the Levites, who bore the
ark of Yahweh’s covenant, saying, <span class="bibleverse">26</span>
“Take this book of the law, and put it by the side of the ark of Yahweh
your God’s covenant, that it may be there for a witness against you.
<span class="bibleverse">27</span> For I know your rebellion and your
stiff neck. Behold, while I am yet alive with you today, you have been
rebellious against Yahweh. How much more after my death? <span
class="bibleverse">28</span> Assemble to me all the elders of your
tribes and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears,
and call heaven and earth to witness against them. <span
class="bibleverse">29</span> For I know that after my death you will
utterly corrupt yourselves, and turn away from the way which I have
commanded you; and evil will happen to you in the latter days, because
you will do that which is evil in Yahweh’s sight, to provoke him to
anger through the work of your hands.” <span
class="bibleverse">30</span> Moses spoke in the ears of all the assembly
of Israel the words of this song, until they were finished.</p>
<h1 id="section-31">32</h1>
<h2 id="the-song-of-moses">The Song of Moses</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Give ear, you heavens, and I will
speak. Let the earth hear the words of my mouth. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> My doctrine will drop as the rain. My speech
will condense as the dew, as the misty rain on the tender grass, as the
showers on the herb. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> For I will
proclaim Yahweh’s name. Ascribe greatness to our God! <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> The Rock: his work is perfect, for all his
ways are just. A God of faithfulness who does no wrong, just and right
is he. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> They have dealt corruptly with
him. They are not his children, because of their defect. They are a
perverse and crooked generation. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> Is
this the way you repay Yahweh, foolish and unwise people? Isn’t he your
father who has bought you? He has made you and established you. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> Remember the days of old. Consider the years
of many generations. Ask your father, and he will show you; your elders,
and they will tell you. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> When the Most
High gave to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the
children of men, he set the bounds of the peoples according to the
number of the children of Israel. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> For
Yahweh’s portion is his people. Jacob is the lot of his inheritance.
<span class="bibleverse">10</span> He found him in a desert land, in the
waste howling wilderness. He surrounded him. He cared for him. He kept
him as the apple of his eye. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> As an
eagle that stirs up her nest, that flutters over her young, he spread
abroad his wings, he took them, he bore them on his feathers. <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> Yahweh alone led him. There was no foreign
god with him. <span class="bibleverse">13</span> He made him ride on the
high places of the earth. He ate the increase of the field. He caused
him to suck honey out of the rock, oil out of the flinty rock; <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> butter from the herd, and milk from the
flock, with fat of lambs, rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, with
the finest of the wheat. From the blood of the grape, you drank wine.
<span class="bibleverse">15</span> But Jeshurun grew fat, and kicked.
You have grown fat. You have grown thick. You have become sleek. Then he
abandoned God who made him, and rejected the Rock of his salvation.
<span class="bibleverse">16</span> They moved him to jealousy with
strange gods. They provoked him to anger with abominations. <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> They sacrificed to demons, not God, to gods
that they didn’t know, to new gods that came up recently, which your
fathers didn’t dread. <span class="bibleverse">18</span> Of the Rock who
became your father, you are unmindful, and have forgotten God who gave
you birth. <span class="bibleverse">19</span> Yahweh saw and abhorred,
because of the provocation of his sons and his daughters. <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> He said, “I will hide my face from them. I
will see what their end will be; for they are a very perverse
generation, children in whom is no faithfulness. <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> They have moved me to jealousy with that
which is not God. They have provoked me to anger with their vanities. I
will move them to jealousy with those who are not a people. I will
provoke them to anger with a foolish nation. <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> For a fire is kindled in my anger, that
burns to the lowest Sheol,<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> devours the earth with
its increase, and sets the foundations of the mountains on fire. <span
class="bibleverse">23</span> “I will heap evils on them. I will spend my
arrows on them. <span class="bibleverse">24</span> They shall be wasted
with hunger, and devoured with burning heat and bitter destruction. I
will send the teeth of animals on them, with the venom of vipers that
glide in the dust. <span class="bibleverse">25</span> Outside the sword
will bereave, and in the rooms, terror on both young man and virgin, the
nursing infant with the gray-haired man. <span
class="bibleverse">26</span> I said that I would scatter them afar. I
would make their memory to cease from among men; <span
class="bibleverse">27</span> were it not that I feared the provocation
of the enemy, lest their adversaries should judge wrongly, lest they
should say, ‘Our hand is exalted; Yahweh has not done all this.’” <span
class="bibleverse">28</span> For they are a nation void of counsel.
There is no understanding in them. <span class="bibleverse">29</span> Oh
that they were wise, that they understood this, that they would consider
their latter end! <span class="bibleverse">30</span> How could one chase
a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, unless their Rock had
sold them, and Yahweh had delivered them up? <span
class="bibleverse">31</span> For their rock is not as our Rock, even our
enemies themselves concede. <span class="bibleverse">32</span> For their
vine is of the vine of Sodom, of the fields of Gomorrah. Their grapes
are poison grapes. Their clusters are bitter. <span
class="bibleverse">33</span> Their wine is the poison of serpents, the
cruel venom of asps. <span class="bibleverse">34</span> “Isn’t this laid
up in store with me, sealed up among my treasures? <span
class="bibleverse">35</span> Vengeance is mine, and recompense, at the
time when their foot slides, for the day of their calamity is at hand.
Their doom rushes at them.” <span class="bibleverse">36</span> For
Yahweh will judge his people, and have compassion on his servants, when
he sees that their power is gone, that there is no one remaining, shut
up or left at large. <span class="bibleverse">37</span> He will say,
“Where are their gods, the rock in which they took refuge, <span
class="bibleverse">38</span> which ate the fat of their sacrifices, and
drank the wine of their drink offering? Let them rise up and help you!
Let them be your protection. <span class="bibleverse">39</span> “See now
that I myself am he. There is no god with me. I kill and I make alive. I
wound and I heal. There is no one who can deliver out of my hand. <span
class="bibleverse">40</span> For I lift up my hand to heaven and
declare, as I live forever, <span class="bibleverse">41</span> if I
sharpen my glittering sword, my hand grasps it in judgment; I will take
vengeance on my adversaries, and will repay those who hate me. <span
class="bibleverse">42</span> I will make my arrows drunk with blood. My
sword shall devour flesh with the blood of the slain and the captives,
from the head of the leaders of the enemy.” <span
class="bibleverse">43</span> Rejoice, you nations, with his people, for
he will avenge the blood of his servants. He will take vengeance on his
adversaries, and will make atonement for his land and for his people.<a

<span class="bibleverse">45</span> Moses finished reciting all these
words to all Israel. <span class="bibleverse">46</span> He said to them,
“Set your heart to all the words which I testify to you today, which you
shall command your children to observe to do, all the words of this law.
<span class="bibleverse">47</span> For it is no vain thing for you,
because it is your life, and through this thing you shall prolong your
days in the land, where you go over the Jordan to possess it.” <span
class="bibleverse">48</span> Yahweh spoke to Moses that same day,
saying, <span class="bibleverse">49</span> “Go up into this mountain of
Abarim, to Mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is across from
Jericho; and see the land of Canaan, which I give to the children of
Israel for a possession. <span class="bibleverse">50</span> Die on the
mountain where you go up, and be gathered to your people, as Aaron your
brother died on Mount Hor, and was gathered to his people; <span
class="bibleverse">51</span> because you trespassed against me among the
children of Israel at the waters of Meribah of Kadesh, in the wilderness
of Zin; because you didn’t uphold my holiness among the children of
Israel. <span class="bibleverse">52</span> For you shall see the land
from a distance; but you shall not go there into the land which I give
the children of Israel.”</p>

Farewell Blessing on the Twelve Tribes of Israel</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> This is the blessing with which
Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death.

against his adversaries.” <span class="bibleverse">8</span> About Levi
he said, “Your Thummim and your Urim are with your godly one, whom you
proved at Massah, with whom you contended at the waters of Meribah.
<span class="bibleverse">9</span> He said of his father, and of his
mother, ‘I have not seen him.’ He didn’t acknowledge his brothers, nor
did he know his own children; for they have observed your word, and keep
your covenant. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> They shall teach Jacob
your ordinances, and Israel your law. They shall put incense before you,
and whole burnt offering on your altar. <span

of those who hate him, that they not rise again.” <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> About Benjamin he said, “The beloved of
Yahweh will dwell in safety by him. He covers him all day long. He
dwells between his shoulders.” <span class="bibleverse">13</span> About
Joseph he said, “His land is blessed by Yahweh, for the precious things
of the heavens, for the dew, for the deep that couches beneath, <span

the sun, for the precious things that the moon can yield, <span

the wild ox. With them he will push all the peoples to the ends of the

“Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going out; and Issachar, in your tents. <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> They will call the peoples to the mountain.
There they will offer sacrifices of righteousness, for they will draw
out the abundance of the seas, the hidden treasures of the sand.” <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> About Gad he said, “He who enlarges Gad is
blessed. He dwells as a lioness, and tears the arm and the crown of the
head. <span class="bibleverse">21</span> He provided the first part for
himself, for the lawgiver’s portion was reserved for him. He came with
the heads of the people. He executed the righteousness of Yahweh, His
ordinances with Israel.” <span class="bibleverse">22</span> About Dan he
said, “Dan is a lion’s cub that leaps out of Bashan.” <span
class="bibleverse">23</span> About Naphtali he said, “Naphtali,
satisfied with favor, full of Yahweh’s blessing, Possess the west and
the south.” <span class="bibleverse">24</span> About Asher he said,
“Asher is blessed with children. Let him be acceptable to his brothers.

which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, ‘I will give
it to your offspring.’ I have caused you to see it with your eyes, but
you shall not go over there.” <span class="bibleverse">5</span> So Moses
the servant of Yahweh died there in the land of Moab, according to
Yahweh’s word. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> He buried him in the
valley in the land of Moab opposite Beth Peor, but no man knows where
his tomb is to this day. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> Moses was one
hundred twenty years old when he died. His eye was not dim, nor his
strength gone. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> The children of Israel
wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days, until the days of
