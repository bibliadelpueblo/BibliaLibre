<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Peter, an apostle of Jesus
Christ,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> to the chosen ones who are living as
foreigners in the Dispersion in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and
Bithynia, <span class="bibleverse">2</span> according to the
foreknowledge of God the Father, in sanctification of the Spirit, that
you may obey Jesus Christ and be sprinkled with his blood: Grace to you
and peace be multiplied.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">3</span> Blessed be the God and Father of
our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to his great mercy caused us to be
born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ
from the dead, <span class="bibleverse">4</span> to an incorruptible and
undefiled inheritance that doesn’t fade away, reserved in Heaven for
you, <span class="bibleverse">5</span> who by the power of God are
guarded through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last
time. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> In this you greatly rejoice,
though now for a little while, if need be, you have been grieved in
various trials, <span class="bibleverse">7</span> that the proof of your
faith, which is more precious than gold that perishes, even though it is
tested by fire, may be found to result in praise, glory, and honor at
the revelation of Jesus Christ— <span class="bibleverse">8</span> whom,
not having known, you love. In him, though now you don’t see him, yet
believing, you rejoice greatly with joy that is unspeakable and full of
glory, <span class="bibleverse">9</span> receiving the result of your
faith, the salvation of your souls.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">10</span> Concerning this salvation, the
prophets sought and searched diligently. They prophesied of the grace
that would come to you, <span class="bibleverse">11</span> searching for
who or what kind of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them pointed
to when he predicted the sufferings of Christ and the glories that would
follow them. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> To them it was revealed
that they served not themselves, but you, in these things, which now
have been announced to you through those who preached the Good News to
you by the Holy Spirit sent out from heaven; which things angels desire
to look into.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">13</span> Therefore prepare your minds for
action.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Be sober, and set your hope fully on
the grace that will be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ—
<span class="bibleverse">14</span> as children of obedience, not
conforming yourselves according to your former lusts as in your
ignorance, <span class="bibleverse">15</span> but just as he who called
you is holy, you yourselves also be holy in all of your behavior, <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> because it is written, “You shall be holy,
for I am holy.”<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">17</span> If you call on him as Father, who
without respect of persons judges according to each man’s work, pass the
time of your living as foreigners here in reverent fear, <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> knowing that you were redeemed, not with
corruptible things like silver or gold, from the useless way of life
handed down from your fathers, <span class="bibleverse">19</span> but
with precious blood, as of a lamb without blemish or spot, the blood of
Christ, <span class="bibleverse">20</span> who was foreknown indeed
before the foundation of the world, but was revealed in this last age
for your sake, <span class="bibleverse">21</span> who through him are
believers in God, who raised him from the dead and gave him glory, so
that your faith and hope might be in God.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">22</span> Seeing you have purified your
souls in your obedience to the truth through the Spirit in sincere
brotherly affection, love one another from the heart fervently, <span
class="bibleverse">23</span> having been born again, not of corruptible
seed, but of incorruptible, through the word of God, which lives and
remains forever. <span class="bibleverse">24</span> For, “All flesh is
like grass, and all of man’s glory like the flower in the grass. The
grass withers, and its flower falls; <span class="bibleverse">25</span>
but the Lord’s word endures forever.”<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>This is the word of Good News which was preached to you.</p>
<h1 id="section-1">2</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Putting away therefore all
wickedness, all deceit, hypocrisies, envies, and all evil speaking,
<span class="bibleverse">2</span> as newborn babies, long for the pure
spiritual milk, that with it you may grow, <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> if indeed you have tasted that the Lord is
gracious. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> Come to him, a living stone,
rejected indeed by men, but chosen by God, precious. <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> You also as living stones are built up as a
spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual
sacrifices, acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> Because it is contained in Scripture,
“Behold,<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> I lay in Zion a chief cornerstone,
chosen and precious. He who believes in him will not be disappointed.”<a
href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">7</span> For you who believe therefore is
the honor, but for those who are disobedient, “The stone which the
builders rejected has become the chief cornerstone,”<a href="#fn7"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">8</span> and, “a stumbling stone and a rock
of offense.”<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>For they stumble at the word, being disobedient, to which also they
were appointed. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> But you are a chosen
race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God’s own
possession, that you may proclaim the excellence of him who called you
out of darkness into his marvelous light. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> In the past, you were not a people, but now
are God’s people, who had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained
mercy.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">11</span> Beloved, I beg you as foreigners
and pilgrims to abstain from fleshly lusts which war against the soul,
<span class="bibleverse">12</span> having good behavior among the
nations, so in that of which they speak against you as evildoers, they
may see your good works and glorify God in the day of visitation.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">13</span> Therefore subject yourselves to
every ordinance of man for the Lord’s sake: whether to the king, as
supreme, <span class="bibleverse">14</span> or to governors, as sent by
him for vengeance on evildoers and for praise to those who do well.
<span class="bibleverse">15</span> For this is the will of God, that by
well-doing you should put to silence the ignorance of foolish men. <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> Live as free people, yet not using your
freedom for a cloak of wickedness, but as bondservants of God.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">17</span> Honor all men. Love the
brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">18</span> Servants, be in subjection to your
masters with all respect, not only to the good and gentle, but also to
the wicked. <span class="bibleverse">19</span> For it is commendable if
someone endures pain, suffering unjustly, because of conscience toward
God. <span class="bibleverse">20</span> For what glory is it if, when
you sin, you patiently endure beating? But if when you do well, you
patiently endure suffering, this is commendable with God. <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> For you were called to this, because Christ
also suffered for us, leaving you<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> an example, that you
should follow his steps, <span class="bibleverse">22</span> who didn’t
sin, “neither was deceit found in his mouth.”<a href="#fn10"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>
<span class="bibleverse">23</span> When he was cursed, he didn’t curse
back. When he suffered, he didn’t threaten, but committed himself to him
who judges righteously. <span class="bibleverse">24</span> He himself
bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we, having died to sins,
might live to righteousness. You were healed by his wounds.<a
href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> <span class="bibleverse">25</span>
For you were going astray like sheep; but now you have returned to the
Shepherd and Overseer<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> of your souls.</p>
<h1 id="section-2">3</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> In the same way, wives, be in
subjection to your own husbands, so that, even if any don’t obey the
Word, they may be won by the behavior of their wives without a word,
<span class="bibleverse">2</span> seeing your pure behavior in fear.
<span class="bibleverse">3</span> Let your beauty come not from the
outward adorning of braiding your hair, and of wearing gold ornaments or
of putting on fine clothing, <span class="bibleverse">4</span> but from
the hidden person of the heart, in the incorruptible adornment of a
gentle and quiet spirit, which is very precious in God’s sight. <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> For this is how in the past the holy women
who hoped in God also adorned themselves, being in subjection to their
own husbands. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> So Sarah obeyed Abraham,
calling him lord, whose children you now are if you do well and are not
put in fear by any terror.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">7</span> You husbands, in the same way, live
with your wives according to knowledge, giving honor to the woman as to
the weaker vessel, as also being joint heirs of the grace of life, that
your prayers may not be hindered.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">8</span> Finally, all of you be like-minded,
compassionate, loving as brothers, tenderhearted, courteous, <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> not rendering evil for evil or insult for
insult; but instead blessing, knowing that you were called to this, that
you may inherit a blessing. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> For, “He
who would love life and see good days, let him keep his tongue from evil
and his lips from speaking deceit. <span class="bibleverse">11</span>
Let him turn away from evil and do good. Let him seek peace and pursue
it. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> For the eyes of the Lord are on
the righteous, and his ears open to their prayer; but the face of the
Lord is against those who do evil.”<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">13</span> Now who will harm you if you
become imitators of that which is good? <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> But even if you should suffer for
righteousness’ sake, you are blessed. “Don’t fear what they fear,
neither be troubled.”<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> <span class="bibleverse">15</span>
But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts. Always be ready to give an
answer to everyone who asks you a reason concerning the hope that is in
you, with humility and fear, <span class="bibleverse">16</span> having a
good conscience. Thus, while you are spoken against as evildoers, they
may be disappointed who curse your good way of life in Christ. <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> For it is better, if it is God’s will, that
you suffer for doing what is right than for doing evil. <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> Because Christ also suffered for sins once,
the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring you to God, being
put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the Spirit, <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> in whom he also went and preached to the
spirits in prison, <span class="bibleverse">20</span> who before were
disobedient when God waited patiently in the days of Noah while the ship
was being built. In it, few, that is, eight souls, were saved through
water. <span class="bibleverse">21</span> This is a symbol of baptism,
which now saves you—not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but
the answer of a good conscience toward God—through the resurrection of
Jesus Christ, <span class="bibleverse">22</span> who is at the right
hand of God, having gone into heaven, angels and authorities and powers
being made subject to him.</p>
<h1 id="section-3">4</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Therefore, since Christ suffered
for us in the flesh, arm yourselves also with the same mind; for he who
has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin, <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> that you no longer should live the rest of
your time in the flesh for the lusts of men, but for the will of God.
<span class="bibleverse">3</span> For we have spent enough of our past
time doing the desire of the Gentiles, and having walked in lewdness,
lusts, drunken binges, orgies, carousings, and abominable idolatries.
<span class="bibleverse">4</span> They think it is strange that you
don’t run with them into the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you.
<span class="bibleverse">5</span> They will give account to him who is
ready to judge the living and the dead. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> For to this end the Good News was preached
even to the dead, that they might be judged indeed as men in the flesh,
but live as to God in the spirit.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">7</span> But the end of all things is near.
Therefore be of sound mind, self-controlled, and sober in prayer. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> And above all things be earnest in your love
among yourselves, for love covers a multitude of sins. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> Be hospitable to one another without
grumbling. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> As each has received a
gift, employ it in serving one another, as good managers of the grace of
God in its various forms. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> If anyone
speaks, let it be as it were the very words of God. If anyone serves,
let it be as of the strength which God supplies, that in all things God
may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom belong the glory and the
dominion forever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">12</span> Beloved, don’t be astonished at
the fiery trial which has come upon you to test you, as though a strange
thing happened to you. <span class="bibleverse">13</span> But because
you are partakers of Christ’s sufferings, rejoice, that at the
revelation of his glory you also may rejoice with exceeding joy. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> If you are insulted for the name of Christ,
you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you. On
their part he is blasphemed, but on your part he is glorified. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> But let none of you suffer as a murderer,
or a thief, or an evil doer, or a meddler in other men’s matters. <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> But if one of you suffers for being a
Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God in this
matter. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> For the time has come for
judgment to begin with the household of God. If it begins first with us,
what will happen to those who don’t obey the Good News of God? <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> “If it is hard for the righteous to be
saved, what will happen to the ungodly and the sinner?”<a href="#fn15"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a>
<span class="bibleverse">19</span> Therefore let them also who suffer
according to the will of God in doing good entrust their souls to him,
as to a faithful Creator.</p>
<h1 id="section-4">5</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Therefore I exhort the elders among
you, as a fellow elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and
who will also share in the glory that will be revealed: <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> shepherd the flock of God which is among
you, exercising the oversight, not under compulsion, but voluntarily;
not for dishonest gain, but willingly; <span class="bibleverse">3</span>
not as lording it over those entrusted to you, but making yourselves
examples to the flock. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> When the chief
Shepherd is revealed, you will receive the crown of glory that doesn’t
fade away.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">5</span> Likewise, you younger ones, be
subject to the elder. Yes, all of you clothe yourselves with humility
and subject yourselves to one another; for “God resists the proud, but
gives grace to the humble.”<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty
hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time, <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> casting all your worries on him, because he
cares for you.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">8</span> Be sober and self-controlled. Be
watchful. Your adversary, the devil, walks around like a roaring lion,
seeking whom he may devour. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> Withstand
him steadfast in your faith, knowing that your brothers who are in the
world are undergoing the same sufferings. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> But may the God of all grace, who called
you to his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after you have suffered a
little while, perfect, establish, strengthen, and settle you. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> To him be the glory and the power forever
and ever. Amen.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">12</span> Through Silvanus, our faithful
brother, as I consider him, I have written to you briefly, exhorting and
testifying that this is the true grace of God in which you stand. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> She who is in Babylon, chosen together with
you, greets you. So does Mark, my son. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> Greet one another with a kiss of love.</p>
<p>Peace be to all of you who are in Christ Jesus. Amen.</p>
