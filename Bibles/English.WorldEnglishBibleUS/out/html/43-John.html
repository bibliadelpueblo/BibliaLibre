<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> In the beginning was the Word, and
the Word was with God, and the Word was God. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> The same was in the beginning with God.
<span class="bibleverse">3</span> All things were made through him.
Without him, nothing was made that has been made. <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> In him was life, and the life was the light
of men. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> The light shines in the
darkness, and the darkness hasn’t overcome<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
it.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">6</span> There came a man sent from God,
whose name was John. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> The same came as
a witness, that he might testify about the light, that all might believe
through him. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> He was not the light, but
was sent that he might testify about the light. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> The true light that enlightens everyone was
coming into the world.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">10</span> He was in the world, and the world
was made through him, and the world didn’t recognize him. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> He came to his own, and those who were his
own didn’t receive him. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> But as many
as received him, to them he gave the right to become God’s children, to
those who believe in his name: <span class="bibleverse">13</span> who
were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will
of man, but of God.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">14</span> The Word became flesh and lived
among us. We saw his glory, such glory as of the only born<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Son
of the Father, full of grace and truth. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> John testified about him. He cried out,
saying, “This was he of whom I said, ‘He who comes after me has
surpassed me, for he was before me.’” <span class="bibleverse">16</span>
From his fullness we all received grace upon grace. <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> For the law was given through Moses. Grace
and truth were realized through Jesus Christ.<a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>
<span class="bibleverse">18</span> No one has seen God at any time. The
only born<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> Son,<a href="#fn5"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> who
is in the bosom of the Father, has declared him.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">19</span> This is John’s testimony, when the
Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, “Who are
you?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">20</span> He declared, and didn’t deny, but
he declared, “I am not the Christ.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">21</span> They asked him, “What then? Are
you Elijah?”</p>
<p>He said, “I am not.”</p>
<p>“Are you the prophet?”</p>
<p>He answered, “No.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">22</span> They said therefore to him, “Who
are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do
you say about yourself?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">23</span> He said, “I am the voice of one
crying in the wilderness, ‘Make straight the way of the Lord,’<a
href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> as Isaiah the prophet said.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">24</span> The ones who had been sent were
from the Pharisees. <span class="bibleverse">25</span> They asked him,
“Why then do you baptize if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the
prophet?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">26</span> John answered them, “I baptize in
water, but among you stands one whom you don’t know. <span
class="bibleverse">27</span> He is the one who comes after me, who is
preferred before me, whose sandal strap I’m not worthy to loosen.” <span
class="bibleverse">28</span> These things were done in Bethany beyond
the Jordan, where John was baptizing.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">29</span> The next day, he saw Jesus coming
to him, and said, “Behold,<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> the Lamb of God, who
takes away the sin of the world! <span class="bibleverse">30</span> This
is he of whom I said, ‘After me comes a man who is preferred before me,
for he was before me.’ <span class="bibleverse">31</span> I didn’t know
him, but for this reason I came baptizing in water, that he would be
revealed to Israel.” <span class="bibleverse">32</span> John testified,
saying, “I have seen the Spirit descending like a dove out of heaven,
and it remained on him. <span class="bibleverse">33</span> I didn’t
recognize him, but he who sent me to baptize in water said to me, ‘On
whomever you will see the Spirit descending and remaining on him is he
who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.’ <span class="bibleverse">34</span> I
have seen and have testified that this is the Son of God.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">35</span> Again, the next day, John was
standing with two of his disciples, <span class="bibleverse">36</span>
and he looked at Jesus as he walked, and said, “Behold, the Lamb of
God!” <span class="bibleverse">37</span> The two disciples heard him
speak, and they followed Jesus. <span class="bibleverse">38</span> Jesus
turned and saw them following, and said to them, “What are you looking
for?”</p>
<p>They said to him, “Rabbi” (which is to say, being interpreted,
Teacher), “where are you staying?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">39</span> He said to them, “Come and
see.”</p>
<p>They came and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that
day. It was about the tenth hour.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> <span
class="bibleverse">40</span> One of the two who heard John and followed
him was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother. <span
class="bibleverse">41</span> He first found his own brother, Simon, and
said to him, “We have found the Messiah!” (which is, being interpreted,
Christ<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> ). <span
class="bibleverse">42</span> He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at
him and said, “You are Simon the son of Jonah. You shall be called
Cephas” (which is by interpretation, Peter).<a href="#fn10"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">43</span> On the next day, he was determined
to go out into Galilee, and he found Philip. Jesus said to him, “Follow
me.” <span class="bibleverse">44</span> Now Philip was from Bethsaida,
the city of Andrew and Peter. <span class="bibleverse">45</span> Philip
found Nathanael, and said to him, “We have found him of whom Moses in
the law and also the prophets, wrote: Jesus of Nazareth, the son of
Joseph.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">46</span> Nathanael said to him, “Can any
good thing come out of Nazareth?”</p>
<p>Philip said to him, “Come and see.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">47</span> Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him,
and said about him, “Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no
deceit!”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">48</span> Nathanael said to him, “How do you
know me?”</p>
<p>Jesus answered him, “Before Philip called you, when you were under
the fig tree, I saw you.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">49</span> Nathanael answered him, “Rabbi,
you are the Son of God! You are King of Israel!”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">50</span> Jesus answered him, “Because I
told you, ‘I saw you underneath the fig tree,’ do you believe? You will
see greater things than these!” <span class="bibleverse">51</span> He
said to him, “Most certainly, I tell you all, hereafter you will see
heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son
of Man.”</p>
<h1 id="section-1">2</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> The third day, there was a wedding
in Cana of Galilee. Jesus’ mother was there. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> Jesus also was invited, with his disciples,
to the wedding. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> When the wine ran out,
Jesus’ mother said to him, “They have no wine.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">4</span> Jesus said to her, “Woman, what
does that have to do with you and me? My hour has not yet come.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">5</span> His mother said to the servants,
“Whatever he says to you, do it.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">6</span> Now there were six water pots of
stone set there after the Jews’ way of purifying, containing two or
three metretes<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> apiece. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> Jesus said to them, “Fill the water pots
with water.” So they filled them up to the brim. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> He said to them, “Now draw some out, and
take it to the ruler of the feast.” So they took it. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> When the ruler of the feast tasted the water
now become wine, and didn’t know where it came from (but the servants
who had drawn the water knew), the ruler of the feast called the
bridegroom <span class="bibleverse">10</span> and said to him, “Everyone
serves the good wine first, and when the guests have drunk freely, then
that which is worse. You have kept the good wine until now!” <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> This beginning of his signs Jesus did in
Cana of Galilee, and revealed his glory; and his disciples believed in
him.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">12</span> After this, he went down to
Capernaum, he, and his mother, his brothers, and his disciples; and they
stayed there a few days.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">13</span> The Passover of the Jews was at
hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. <span class="bibleverse">14</span>
He found in the temple those who sold oxen, sheep, and doves, and the
changers of money sitting. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> He made a
whip of cords and drove all out of the temple, both the sheep and the
oxen; and he poured out the changers’ money and overthrew their tables.
<span class="bibleverse">16</span> To those who sold the doves, he said,
“Take these things out of here! Don’t make my Father’s house a
marketplace!” <span class="bibleverse">17</span> His disciples
remembered that it was written, “Zeal for your house will eat me up.”<a
href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">18</span> The Jews therefore answered him,
“What sign do you show us, seeing that you do these things?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">19</span> Jesus answered them, “Destroy this
temple, and in three days I will raise it up.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">20</span> The Jews therefore said, “It took
forty-six years to build this temple! Will you raise it up in three
days?” <span class="bibleverse">21</span> But he spoke of the temple of
his body. <span class="bibleverse">22</span> When therefore he was
raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he said this, and
they believed the Scripture and the word which Jesus had said.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">23</span> Now when he was in Jerusalem at
the Passover, during the feast, many believed in his name, observing his
signs which he did. <span class="bibleverse">24</span> But Jesus didn’t
entrust himself to them, because he knew everyone, <span
class="bibleverse">25</span> and because he didn’t need for anyone to
testify concerning man; for he himself knew what was in man.</p>
<h1 id="section-2">3</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Now there was a man of the
Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> He came to Jesus by night and said to him,
“Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God, for no one can do
these signs that you do, unless God is with him.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">3</span> Jesus answered him, “Most certainly
I tell you, unless one is born anew, <a href="#fn13"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a>
he can’t see God’s Kingdom.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">4</span> Nicodemus said to him, “How can a
man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother’s
womb and be born?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">5</span> Jesus answered, “Most certainly I
tell you, unless one is born of water and Spirit, he can’t enter into
God’s Kingdom. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> That which is born of
the flesh is flesh. That which is born of the Spirit is spirit. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> Don’t marvel that I said to you, ‘You must
be born anew.’ <span class="bibleverse">8</span> The wind<a href="#fn14"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>
blows where it wants to, and you hear its sound, but don’t know where it
comes from and where it is going. So is everyone who is born of the
Spirit.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">9</span> Nicodemus answered him, “How can
these things be?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">10</span> Jesus answered him, “Are you the
teacher of Israel, and don’t understand these things? <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> Most certainly I tell you, we speak that
which we know and testify of that which we have seen, and you don’t
receive our witness. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> If I told you
earthly things and you don’t believe, how will you believe if I tell you
heavenly things? <span class="bibleverse">13</span> No one has ascended
into heaven but he who descended out of heaven, the Son of Man, who is
in heaven. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> As Moses lifted up the
serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up,
<span class="bibleverse">15</span> that whoever believes in him should
not perish, but have eternal life. <span class="bibleverse">16</span>
For God so loved the world, that he gave his only born<a href="#fn15"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a>
Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal
life. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> For God didn’t send his Son
into the world to judge the world, but that the world should be saved
through him. <span class="bibleverse">18</span> He who believes in him
is not judged. He who doesn’t believe has been judged already, because
he has not believed in the name of the only born Son of God. <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> This is the judgment, that the light has
come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light,
for their works were evil. <span class="bibleverse">20</span> For
everyone who does evil hates the light and doesn’t come to the light,
lest his works would be exposed. <span class="bibleverse">21</span> But
he who does the truth comes to the light, that his works may be
revealed, that they have been done in God.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">22</span> After these things, Jesus came
with his disciples into the land of Judea. He stayed there with them and
baptized. <span class="bibleverse">23</span> John also was baptizing in
Enon near Salim, because there was much water there. They came and were
baptized; <span class="bibleverse">24</span> for John was not yet thrown
into prison. <span class="bibleverse">25</span> Therefore a dispute
arose on the part of John’s disciples with some Jews about purification.
<span class="bibleverse">26</span> They came to John and said to him,
“Rabbi, he who was with you beyond the Jordan, to whom you have
testified, behold, he baptizes, and everyone is coming to him.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">27</span> John answered, “A man can receive
nothing unless it has been given him from heaven. <span
class="bibleverse">28</span> You yourselves testify that I said, ‘I am
not the Christ,’ but, ‘I have been sent before him.’ <span
class="bibleverse">29</span> He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but
the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly
because of the bridegroom’s voice. Therefore my joy is made full. <span
class="bibleverse">30</span> He must increase, but I must decrease.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">31</span> “He who comes from above is above
all. He who is from the earth belongs to the earth and speaks of the
earth. He who comes from heaven is above all. <span
class="bibleverse">32</span> What he has seen and heard, of that he
testifies; and no one receives his witness. <span
class="bibleverse">33</span> He who has received his witness has set his
seal to this, that God is true. <span class="bibleverse">34</span> For
he whom God has sent speaks the words of God; for God gives the Spirit
without measure. <span class="bibleverse">35</span> The Father loves the
Son, and has given all things into his hand. <span
class="bibleverse">36</span> One who believes in the Son has eternal
life, but one who disobeys<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> the Son won’t see
life, but the wrath of God remains on him.”</p>
<h1 id="section-3">4</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Therefore when the Lord knew that
the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more
disciples than John <span class="bibleverse">2</span> (although Jesus
himself didn’t baptize, but his disciples), <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> he left Judea and departed into Galilee.
<span class="bibleverse">4</span> He needed to pass through Samaria.
<span class="bibleverse">5</span> So he came to a city of Samaria called
Sychar, near the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.
<span class="bibleverse">6</span> Jacob’s well was there. Jesus
therefore, being tired from his journey, sat down by the well. It was
about the sixth hour.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">7</span> A woman of Samaria came to draw
water. Jesus said to her, “Give me a drink.” <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> For his disciples had gone away into the
city to buy food.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">9</span> The Samaritan woman therefore said
to him, “How is it that you, being a Jew, ask for a drink from me, a
Samaritan woman?” (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">10</span> Jesus answered her, “If you knew
the gift of God, and who it is who says to you, ‘Give me a drink,’ you
would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">11</span> The woman said to him, “Sir, you
have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep. So where do you get
that living water? <span class="bibleverse">12</span> Are you greater
than our father Jacob, who gave us the well and drank from it himself,
as did his children and his livestock?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">13</span> Jesus answered her, “Everyone who
drinks of this water will thirst again, <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> but whoever drinks of the water that I will
give him will never thirst again; but the water that I will give him
will become in him a well of water springing up to eternal life.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">15</span> The woman said to him, “Sir, give
me this water, so that I don’t get thirsty, neither come all the way
here to draw.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">16</span> Jesus said to her, “Go, call your
husband, and come here.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">17</span> The woman answered, “I have no
husband.”</p>
<p>Jesus said to her, “You said well, ‘I have no husband,’ <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> for you have had five husbands; and he whom
you now have is not your husband. This you have said truly.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">19</span> The woman said to him, “Sir, I
perceive that you are a prophet. <span class="bibleverse">20</span> Our
fathers worshiped in this mountain, and you Jews say that in Jerusalem
is the place where people ought to worship.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">21</span> Jesus said to her, “Woman, believe
me, the hour is coming when neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem
will you worship the Father. <span class="bibleverse">22</span> You
worship that which you don’t know. We worship that which we know; for
salvation is from the Jews. <span class="bibleverse">23</span> But the
hour comes, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father
in spirit and truth, for the Father seeks such to be his worshipers.
<span class="bibleverse">24</span> God is spirit, and those who worship
him must worship in spirit and truth.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">25</span> The woman said to him, “I know
that Messiah is coming, he who is called Christ.<a href="#fn18"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a>
When he has come, he will declare to us all things.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">26</span> Jesus said to her, “I am he, the
one who speaks to you.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">27</span> Just then, his disciples came.
They marveled that he was speaking with a woman; yet no one said, “What
are you looking for?” or, “Why do you speak with her?” <span
class="bibleverse">28</span> So the woman left her water pot, went away
into the city, and said to the people, <span
class="bibleverse">29</span> “Come, see a man who told me everything
that I have done. Can this be the Christ?” <span
class="bibleverse">30</span> They went out of the city, and were coming
to him.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">31</span> In the meanwhile, the disciples
urged him, saying, “Rabbi, eat.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">32</span> But he said to them, “I have food
to eat that you don’t know about.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">33</span> The disciples therefore said to
one another, “Has anyone brought him something to eat?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">34</span> Jesus said to them, “My food is to
do the will of him who sent me and to accomplish his work. <span
class="bibleverse">35</span> Don’t you say, ‘There are yet four months
until the harvest?’ Behold, I tell you, lift up your eyes and look at
the fields, that they are white for harvest already. <span
class="bibleverse">36</span> He who reaps receives wages and gathers
fruit to eternal life, that both he who sows and he who reaps may
rejoice together. <span class="bibleverse">37</span> For in this the
saying is true, ‘One sows, and another reaps.’ <span
class="bibleverse">38</span> I sent you to reap that for which you
haven’t labored. Others have labored, and you have entered into their
labor.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">39</span> From that city many of the
Samaritans believed in him because of the word of the woman, who
testified, “He told me everything that I have done.” <span
class="bibleverse">40</span> So when the Samaritans came to him, they
begged him to stay with them. He stayed there two days. <span
class="bibleverse">41</span> Many more believed because of his word.
<span class="bibleverse">42</span> They said to the woman, “Now we
believe, not because of your speaking; for we have heard for ourselves,
and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Savior of the world.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">43</span> After the two days he went out
from there and went into Galilee. <span class="bibleverse">44</span> For
Jesus himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country.
<span class="bibleverse">45</span> So when he came into Galilee, the
Galileans received him, having seen all the things that he did in
Jerusalem at the feast, for they also went to the feast. <span
class="bibleverse">46</span> Jesus came therefore again to Cana of
Galilee, where he made the water into wine. There was a certain nobleman
whose son was sick at Capernaum. <span class="bibleverse">47</span> When
he heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee, he went to him
and begged him that he would come down and heal his son, for he was at
the point of death. <span class="bibleverse">48</span> Jesus therefore
said to him, “Unless you see signs and wonders, you will in no way
believe.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">49</span> The nobleman said to him, “Sir,
come down before my child dies.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">50</span> Jesus said to him, “Go your way.
Your son lives.” The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him, and
he went his way. <span class="bibleverse">51</span> As he was going
down, his servants met him and reported, saying “Your child lives!”
<span class="bibleverse">52</span> So he inquired of them the hour when
he began to get better. They said therefore to him, “Yesterday at the
seventh hour,<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> the fever left him.” <span
class="bibleverse">53</span> So the father knew that it was at that hour
in which Jesus said to him, “Your son lives.” He believed, as did his
whole house. <span class="bibleverse">54</span> This is again the second
sign that Jesus did, having come out of Judea into Galilee.</p>
<h1 id="section-4">5</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> After these things, there was a
feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> Now in Jerusalem by the sheep gate, there is
a pool, which is called in Hebrew, “Bethesda”, having five porches.
<span class="bibleverse">3</span> In these lay a great multitude of
those who were sick, blind, lame, or paralyzed, waiting for the moving
of the water; <span class="bibleverse">4</span> for an angel went down
at certain times into the pool and stirred up the water. Whoever stepped
in first after the stirring of the water was healed of whatever disease
he had.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> <span class="bibleverse">5</span> A
certain man was there who had been sick for thirty-eight years. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> When Jesus saw him lying there, and knew
that he had been sick for a long time, he asked him, “Do you want to be
made well?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">7</span> The sick man answered him, “Sir, I
have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up, but
while I’m coming, another steps down before me.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">8</span> Jesus said to him, “Arise, take up
your mat, and walk.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">9</span> Immediately, the man was made well,
and took up his mat and walked.</p>
<p>Now that day was a Sabbath. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> So the
Jews said to him who was cured, “It is the Sabbath. It is not lawful for
you to carry the mat.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">11</span> He answered them, “He who made me
well said to me, ‘Take up your mat and walk.’”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">12</span> Then they asked him, “Who is the
man who said to you, ‘Take up your mat and walk’?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">13</span> But he who was healed didn’t know
who it was, for Jesus had withdrawn, a crowd being in the place.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">14</span> Afterward Jesus found him in the
temple and said to him, “Behold, you are made well. Sin no more, so that
nothing worse happens to you.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">15</span> The man went away, and told the
Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well. <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> For this cause the Jews persecuted Jesus
and sought to kill him, because he did these things on the Sabbath.
<span class="bibleverse">17</span> But Jesus answered them, “My Father
is still working, so I am working, too.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">18</span> For this cause therefore the Jews
sought all the more to kill him, because he not only broke the Sabbath,
but also called God his own Father, making himself equal with God. <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> Jesus therefore answered them, “Most
certainly, I tell you, the Son can do nothing of himself, but what he
sees the Father doing. For whatever things he does, these the Son also
does likewise. <span class="bibleverse">20</span> For the Father has
affection for the Son, and shows him all things that he himself does. He
will show him greater works than these, that you may marvel. <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> For as the Father raises the dead and gives
them life, even so the Son also gives life to whom he desires. <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> For the Father judges no one, but he has
given all judgment to the Son, <span class="bibleverse">23</span> that
all may honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. He who doesn’t
honor the Son doesn’t honor the Father who sent him.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">24</span> “Most certainly I tell you, he who
hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life, and doesn’t
come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life. <span
class="bibleverse">25</span> Most certainly I tell you, the hour comes,
and now is, when the dead will hear the Son of God’s voice; and those
who hear will live. <span class="bibleverse">26</span> For as the Father
has life in himself, even so he gave to the Son also to have life in
himself. <span class="bibleverse">27</span> He also gave him authority
to execute judgment, because he is a son of man. <span
class="bibleverse">28</span> Don’t marvel at this, for the hour comes in
which all who are in the tombs will hear his voice <span
class="bibleverse">29</span> and will come out; those who have done
good, to the resurrection of life; and those who have done evil, to the
resurrection of judgment. <span class="bibleverse">30</span> I can of
myself do nothing. As I hear, I judge; and my judgment is righteous,
because I don’t seek my own will, but the will of my Father who sent
me.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">31</span> “If I testify about myself, my
witness is not valid. <span class="bibleverse">32</span> It is another
who testifies about me. I know that the testimony which he testifies
about me is true. <span class="bibleverse">33</span> You have sent to
John, and he has testified to the truth. <span
class="bibleverse">34</span> But the testimony which I receive is not
from man. However, I say these things that you may be saved. <span
class="bibleverse">35</span> He was the burning and shining lamp, and
you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light. <span
class="bibleverse">36</span> But the testimony which I have is greater
than that of John; for the works which the Father gave me to accomplish,
the very works that I do, testify about me, that the Father has sent me.
<span class="bibleverse">37</span> The Father himself, who sent me, has
testified about me. You have neither heard his voice at any time, nor
seen his form. <span class="bibleverse">38</span> You don’t have his
word living in you, because you don’t believe him whom he sent.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">39</span> “You search the Scriptures,
because you think that in them you have eternal life; and these are they
which testify about me. <span class="bibleverse">40</span> Yet you will
not come to me, that you may have life. <span
class="bibleverse">41</span> I don’t receive glory from men. <span
class="bibleverse">42</span> But I know you, that you don’t have God’s
love in yourselves. <span class="bibleverse">43</span> I have come in my
Father’s name, and you don’t receive me. If another comes in his own
name, you will receive him. <span class="bibleverse">44</span> How can
you believe, who receive glory from one another, and you don’t seek the
glory that comes from the only God?</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">45</span> “Don’t think that I will accuse
you to the Father. There is one who accuses you, even Moses, on whom you
have set your hope. <span class="bibleverse">46</span> For if you
believed Moses, you would believe me; for he wrote about me. <span
class="bibleverse">47</span> But if you don’t believe his writings, how
will you believe my words?”</p>
<h1 id="section-5">6</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> After these things, Jesus went away
to the other side of the sea of Galilee, which is also called the Sea of
Tiberias. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> A great multitude followed
him, because they saw his signs which he did on those who were sick.
<span class="bibleverse">3</span> Jesus went up into the mountain, and
he sat there with his disciples. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> Now
the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was at hand. <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> Jesus therefore, lifting up his eyes and
seeing that a great multitude was coming to him, said to Philip, “Where
are we to buy bread, that these may eat?” <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> He said this to test him, for he himself
knew what he would do.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">7</span> Philip answered him, “Two hundred
denarii<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> worth of bread is not sufficient
for them, that every one of them may receive a little.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">8</span> One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon
Peter’s brother, said to him, <span class="bibleverse">9</span> “There
is a boy here who has five barley loaves and two fish, but what are
these among so many?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">10</span> Jesus said, “Have the people sit
down.” Now there was much grass in that place. So the men sat down, in
number about five thousand. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> Jesus
took the loaves, and having given thanks, he distributed to the
disciples, and the disciples to those who were sitting down, likewise
also of the fish as much as they desired. <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> When they were filled, he said to his
disciples, “Gather up the broken pieces which are left over, that
nothing be lost.” <span class="bibleverse">13</span> So they gathered
them up, and filled twelve baskets with broken pieces from the five
barley loaves, which were left over by those who had eaten. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> When therefore the people saw the sign
which Jesus did, they said, “This is truly the prophet who comes into
the world.” <span class="bibleverse">15</span> Jesus therefore,
perceiving that they were about to come and take him by force to make
him king, withdrew again to the mountain by himself.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">16</span> When evening came, his disciples
went down to the sea. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> They entered
into the boat, and were going over the sea to Capernaum. It was now
dark, and Jesus had not come to them. <span class="bibleverse">18</span>
The sea was tossed by a great wind blowing. <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> When therefore they had rowed about
twenty-five or thirty stadia,<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> they saw Jesus walking
on the sea<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> and drawing near to the boat; and
they were afraid. <span class="bibleverse">20</span> But he said to
them, “It is I.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a> Don’t be afraid.” <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> They were willing therefore to receive him
into the boat. Immediately the boat was at the land where they were
going.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">22</span> On the next day, the multitude
that stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat
there, except the one in which his disciples had embarked, and that
Jesus hadn’t entered with his disciples into the boat, but his disciples
had gone away alone. <span class="bibleverse">23</span> However, boats
from Tiberias came near to the place where they ate the bread after the
Lord had given thanks. <span class="bibleverse">24</span> When the
multitude therefore saw that Jesus wasn’t there, nor his disciples, they
themselves got into the boats and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.
<span class="bibleverse">25</span> When they found him on the other side
of the sea, they asked him, “Rabbi, when did you come here?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">26</span> Jesus answered them, “Most
certainly I tell you, you seek me, not because you saw signs, but
because you ate of the loaves and were filled. <span
class="bibleverse">27</span> Don’t work for the food which perishes, but
for the food which remains to eternal life, which the Son of Man will
give to you. For God the Father has sealed him.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">28</span> They said therefore to him, “What
must we do, that we may work the works of God?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">29</span> Jesus answered them, “This is the
work of God, that you believe in him whom he has sent.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">30</span> They said therefore to him, “What
then do you do for a sign, that we may see and believe you? What work do
you do? <span class="bibleverse">31</span> Our fathers ate the manna in
the wilderness. As it is written, ‘He gave them bread out of heaven<a
href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> to eat.’”<a href="#fn26"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">32</span> Jesus therefore said to them,
“Most certainly, I tell you, it wasn’t Moses who gave you the bread out
of heaven, but my Father gives you the true bread out of heaven. <span
class="bibleverse">33</span> For the bread of God is that which comes
down out of heaven and gives life to the world.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">34</span> They said therefore to him, “Lord,
always give us this bread.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">35</span> Jesus said to them, “I am the
bread of life. Whoever comes to me will not be hungry, and whoever
believes in me will never be thirsty. <span class="bibleverse">36</span>
But I told you that you have seen me, and yet you don’t believe. <span
class="bibleverse">37</span> All those whom the Father gives me will
come to me. He who comes to me I will in no way throw out. <span
class="bibleverse">38</span> For I have come down from heaven, not to do
my own will, but the will of him who sent me. <span
class="bibleverse">39</span> This is the will of my Father who sent me,
that of all he has given to me I should lose nothing, but should raise
him up at the last day. <span class="bibleverse">40</span> This is the
will of the one who sent me, that everyone who sees the Son and believes
in him should have eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last
day.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">41</span> The Jews therefore murmured
concerning him, because he said, “I am the bread which came down out of
heaven.” <span class="bibleverse">42</span> They said, “Isn’t this
Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How then does
he say, ‘I have come down out of heaven?’”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">43</span> Therefore Jesus answered them,
“Don’t murmur among yourselves. <span class="bibleverse">44</span> No
one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him; and I will
raise him up in the last day. <span class="bibleverse">45</span> It is
written in the prophets, ‘They will all be taught by God.’ <a
href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> Therefore everyone who hears from
the Father and has learned, comes to me. <span
class="bibleverse">46</span> Not that anyone has seen the Father, except
he who is from God. He has seen the Father. <span
class="bibleverse">47</span> Most certainly, I tell you, he who believes
in me has eternal life. <span class="bibleverse">48</span> I am the
bread of life. <span class="bibleverse">49</span> Your fathers ate the
manna in the wilderness and they died. <span
class="bibleverse">50</span> This is the bread which comes down out of
heaven, that anyone may eat of it and not die. <span
class="bibleverse">51</span> I am the living bread which came down out
of heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever. Yes, the
bread which I will give for the life of the world is my flesh.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">52</span> The Jews therefore contended with
one another, saying, “How can this man give us his flesh to eat?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">53</span> Jesus therefore said to them,
“Most certainly I tell you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man
and drink his blood, you don’t have life in yourselves. <span
class="bibleverse">54</span> He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood
has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day. <span
class="bibleverse">55</span> For my flesh is food indeed, and my blood
is drink indeed. <span class="bibleverse">56</span> He who eats my flesh
and drinks my blood lives in me, and I in him. <span
class="bibleverse">57</span> As the living Father sent me, and I live
because of the Father, so he who feeds on me will also live because of
me. <span class="bibleverse">58</span> This is the bread which came down
out of heaven—not as our fathers ate the manna and died. He who eats
this bread will live forever.” <span class="bibleverse">59</span> He
said these things in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">60</span> Therefore many of his disciples,
when they heard this, said, “This is a hard saying! Who can listen to
it?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">61</span> But Jesus knowing in himself that
his disciples murmured at this, said to them, “Does this cause you to
stumble? <span class="bibleverse">62</span> Then what if you would see
the Son of Man ascending to where he was before? <span
class="bibleverse">63</span> It is the spirit who gives life. The flesh
profits nothing. The words that I speak to you are spirit, and are life.
<span class="bibleverse">64</span> But there are some of you who don’t
believe.” For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who didn’t
believe, and who it was who would betray him. <span
class="bibleverse">65</span> He said, “For this cause I have said to you
that no one can come to me, unless it is given to him by my Father.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">66</span> At this, many of his disciples
went back and walked no more with him. <span
class="bibleverse">67</span> Jesus said therefore to the twelve, “You
don’t also want to go away, do you?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">68</span> Simon Peter answered him, “Lord,
to whom would we go? You have the words of eternal life. <span
class="bibleverse">69</span> We have come to believe and know that you
are the Christ, the Son of the living God.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">70</span> Jesus answered them, “Didn’t I
choose you, the twelve, and one of you is a devil?” <span
class="bibleverse">71</span> Now he spoke of Judas, the son of Simon
Iscariot, for it was he who would betray him, being one of the
twelve.</p>
<h1 id="section-6">7</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> After these things, Jesus was
walking in Galilee, for he wouldn’t walk in Judea, because the Jews
sought to kill him. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> Now the feast of
the Jews, the Feast of Booths, was at hand. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> His brothers therefore said to him, “Depart
from here and go into Judea, that your disciples also may see your works
which you do. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> For no one does anything
in secret while he seeks to be known openly. If you do these things,
reveal yourself to the world.” <span class="bibleverse">5</span> For
even his brothers didn’t believe in him.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">6</span> Jesus therefore said to them, “My
time has not yet come, but your time is always ready. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> The world can’t hate you, but it hates me,
because I testify about it, that its works are evil. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> You go up to the feast. I am not yet going
up to this feast, because my time is not yet fulfilled.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">9</span> Having said these things to them,
he stayed in Galilee. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> But when his
brothers had gone up to the feast, then he also went up, not publicly,
but as it were in secret. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> The Jews
therefore sought him at the feast, and said, “Where is he?” <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> There was much murmuring among the
multitudes concerning him. Some said, “He is a good man.” Others said,
“Not so, but he leads the multitude astray.” <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> Yet no one spoke openly of him for fear of
the Jews. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> But when it was now the
middle of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple and taught. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> The Jews therefore marveled, saying, “How
does this man know letters, having never been educated?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">16</span> Jesus therefore answered them, “My
teaching is not mine, but his who sent me. <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> If anyone desires to do his will, he will
know about the teaching, whether it is from God or if I am speaking from
myself. <span class="bibleverse">18</span> He who speaks from himself
seeks his own glory, but he who seeks the glory of him who sent him is
true, and no unrighteousness is in him. <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> Didn’t Moses give you the law, and yet none
of you keeps the law? Why do you seek to kill me?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">20</span> The multitude answered, “You have
a demon! Who seeks to kill you?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">21</span> Jesus answered them, “I did one
work and you all marvel because of it. <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> Moses has given you circumcision (not that
it is of Moses, but of the fathers), and on the Sabbath you circumcise a
boy. <span class="bibleverse">23</span> If a boy receives circumcision
on the Sabbath, that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry
with me because I made a man completely healthy on the Sabbath? <span
class="bibleverse">24</span> Don’t judge according to appearance, but
judge righteous judgment.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">25</span> Therefore some of them of
Jerusalem said, “Isn’t this he whom they seek to kill? <span
class="bibleverse">26</span> Behold, he speaks openly, and they say
nothing to him. Can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is truly
the Christ? <span class="bibleverse">27</span> However, we know where
this man comes from, but when the Christ comes, no one will know where
he comes from.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">28</span> Jesus therefore cried out in the
temple, teaching and saying, “You both know me, and know where I am
from. I have not come of myself, but he who sent me is true, whom you
don’t know. <span class="bibleverse">29</span> I know him, because I am
from him, and he sent me.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">30</span> They sought therefore to take him;
but no one laid a hand on him, because his hour had not yet come. <span
class="bibleverse">31</span> But of the multitude, many believed in him.
They said, “When the Christ comes, he won’t do more signs than those
which this man has done, will he?” <span class="bibleverse">32</span>
The Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things concerning him,
and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to arrest him.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">33</span> Then Jesus said, “I will be with
you a little while longer, then I go to him who sent me. <span
class="bibleverse">34</span> You will seek me and won’t find me. You
can’t come where I am.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">35</span> The Jews therefore said among
themselves, “Where will this man go that we won’t find him? Will he go
to the Dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks? <span
class="bibleverse">36</span> What is this word that he said, ‘You will
seek me, and won’t find me;’ and ‘Where I am, you can’t come’?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">37</span> Now on the last and greatest day
of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, “If anyone is thirsty, let him
come to me and drink! <span class="bibleverse">38</span> He who believes
in me, as the Scripture has said, from within him will flow rivers of
living water.” <span class="bibleverse">39</span> But he said this about
the Spirit, which those believing in him were to receive. For the Holy
Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus wasn’t yet glorified.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">40</span> Many of the multitude therefore,
when they heard these words, said, “This is truly the prophet.” <span
class="bibleverse">41</span> Others said, “This is the Christ.” But some
said, “What, does the Christ come out of Galilee? <span
class="bibleverse">42</span> Hasn’t the Scripture said that the Christ
comes of the offspring<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a> of David, <a href="#fn29"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a>
and from Bethlehem,<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a> the village where David was?” <span
class="bibleverse">43</span> So a division arose in the multitude
because of him. <span class="bibleverse">44</span> Some of them would
have arrested him, but no one laid hands on him. <span
class="bibleverse">45</span> The officers therefore came to the chief
priests and Pharisees; and they said to them, “Why didn’t you bring
him?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">46</span> The officers answered, “No man
ever spoke like this man!”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">47</span> The Pharisees therefore answered
them, “You aren’t also led astray, are you? <span
class="bibleverse">48</span> Have any of the rulers or any of the
Pharisees believed in him? <span class="bibleverse">49</span> But this
multitude that doesn’t know the law is cursed.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">50</span> Nicodemus (he who came to him by
night, being one of them) said to them, <span
class="bibleverse">51</span> “Does our law judge a man unless it first
hears from him personally and knows what he does?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">52</span> They answered him, “Are you also
from Galilee? Search and see that no prophet has arisen out of
Galilee.”<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">53</span> Everyone went to his own
house,</p>
<h1 id="section-7">8</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> but Jesus went to the Mount of
Olives.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">2</span> Now very early in the morning, he
came again into the temple, and all the people came to him. He sat down
and taught them. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> The scribes and the
Pharisees brought a woman taken in adultery. Having set her in the
middle, <span class="bibleverse">4</span> they told him, “Teacher, we
found this woman in adultery, in the very act. <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> Now in our law, Moses commanded us to stone
such women.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a> What then do you say about her?”
<span class="bibleverse">6</span> They said this testing him, that they
might have something to accuse him of.</p>
<p>But Jesus stooped down and wrote on the ground with his finger. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> But when they continued asking him, he
looked up and said to them, “He who is without sin among you, let him
throw the first stone at her.” <span class="bibleverse">8</span> Again
he stooped down and wrote on the ground with his finger.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">9</span> They, when they heard it, being
convicted by their conscience, went out one by one, beginning from the
oldest, even to the last. Jesus was left alone with the woman where she
was, in the middle. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> Jesus, standing
up, saw her and said, “Woman, where are your accusers? Did no one
condemn you?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">11</span> She said, “No one, Lord.”</p>
<p>Jesus said, “Neither do I condemn you. Go your way. From now on, sin
no more.”<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">12</span> Again, therefore, Jesus spoke to
them, saying, “I am the light of the world.<a href="#fn34"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a>
He who follows me will not walk in the darkness, but will have the light
of life.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">13</span> The Pharisees therefore said to
him, “You testify about yourself. Your testimony is not valid.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">14</span> Jesus answered them, “Even if I
testify about myself, my testimony is true, for I know where I came
from, and where I am going; but you don’t know where I came from, or
where I am going. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> You judge according
to the flesh. I judge no one. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> Even if
I do judge, my judgment is true, for I am not alone, but I am with the
Father who sent me. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> It’s also written
in your law that the testimony of two people is valid.<a href="#fn35"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35" role="doc-noteref"><sup>35</sup></a>
<span class="bibleverse">18</span> I am one who testifies about myself,
and the Father who sent me testifies about me.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">19</span> They said therefore to him, “Where
is your Father?”</p>
<p>Jesus answered, “You know neither me nor my Father. If you knew me,
you would know my Father also.” <span class="bibleverse">20</span> Jesus
spoke these words in the treasury, as he taught in the temple. Yet no
one arrested him, because his hour had not yet come. <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> Jesus said therefore again to them, “I am
going away, and you will seek me, and you will die in your sins. Where I
go, you can’t come.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">22</span> The Jews therefore said, “Will he
kill himself, because he says, ‘Where I am going, you can’t come’?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">23</span> He said to them, “You are from
beneath. I am from above. You are of this world. I am not of this world.
<span class="bibleverse">24</span> I said therefore to you that you will
die in your sins; for unless you believe that I am<a href="#fn36"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a>
he, you will die in your sins.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">25</span> They said therefore to him, “Who
are you?”</p>
<p>Jesus said to them, “Just what I have been saying to you from the
beginning. <span class="bibleverse">26</span> I have many things to
speak and to judge concerning you. However, he who sent me is true; and
the things which I heard from him, these I say to the world.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">27</span> They didn’t understand that he
spoke to them about the Father. <span class="bibleverse">28</span> Jesus
therefore said to them, “When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then
you will know that I am he, and I do nothing of myself, but as my Father
taught me, I say these things. <span class="bibleverse">29</span> He who
sent me is with me. The Father hasn’t left me alone, for I always do the
things that are pleasing to him.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">30</span> As he spoke these things, many
believed in him. <span class="bibleverse">31</span> Jesus therefore said
to those Jews who had believed him, “If you remain in my word, then you
are truly my disciples. <span class="bibleverse">32</span> You will know
the truth, and the truth will make you free.” <a href="#fn37"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref37"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">33</span> They answered him, “We are
Abraham’s offspring, and have never been in bondage to anyone. How do
you say, ‘You will be made free’?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">34</span> Jesus answered them, “Most
certainly I tell you, everyone who commits sin is the bondservant of
sin. <span class="bibleverse">35</span> A bondservant doesn’t live in
the house forever. A son remains forever. <span
class="bibleverse">36</span> If therefore the Son makes you free, you
will be free indeed. <span class="bibleverse">37</span> I know that you
are Abraham’s offspring, yet you seek to kill me, because my word finds
no place in you. <span class="bibleverse">38</span> I say the things
which I have seen with my Father; and you also do the things which you
have seen with your father.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">39</span> They answered him, “Our father is
Abraham.”</p>
<p>Jesus said to them, “If you were Abraham’s children, you would do the
works of Abraham. <span class="bibleverse">40</span> But now you seek to
kill me, a man who has told you the truth which I heard from God.
Abraham didn’t do this. <span class="bibleverse">41</span> You do the
works of your father.”</p>
<p>They said to him, “We were not born of sexual immorality. We have one
Father, God.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">42</span> Therefore Jesus said to them, “If
God were your father, you would love me, for I came out and have come
from God. For I haven’t come of myself, but he sent me. <span
class="bibleverse">43</span> Why don’t you understand my speech? Because
you can’t hear my word. <span class="bibleverse">44</span> You are of
your father the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father. He
was a murderer from the beginning, and doesn’t stand in the truth,
because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks on his
own; for he is a liar, and the father of lies. <span
class="bibleverse">45</span> But because I tell the truth, you don’t
believe me. <span class="bibleverse">46</span> Which of you convicts me
of sin? If I tell the truth, why do you not believe me? <span
class="bibleverse">47</span> He who is of God hears the words of God.
For this cause you don’t hear, because you are not of God.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">48</span> Then the Jews answered him, “Don’t
we say well that you are a Samaritan, and have a demon?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">49</span> Jesus answered, “I don’t have a
demon, but I honor my Father and you dishonor me. <span
class="bibleverse">50</span> But I don’t seek my own glory. There is one
who seeks and judges. <span class="bibleverse">51</span> Most certainly,
I tell you, if a person keeps my word, he will never see death.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">52</span> Then the Jews said to him, “Now we
know that you have a demon. Abraham died, as did the prophets; and you
say, ‘If a man keeps my word, he will never taste of death.’ <span
class="bibleverse">53</span> Are you greater than our father Abraham,
who died? The prophets died. Who do you make yourself out to be?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">54</span> Jesus answered, “If I glorify
myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father who glorifies me, of whom
you say that he is our God. <span class="bibleverse">55</span> You have
not known him, but I know him. If I said, ‘I don’t know him,’ I would be
like you, a liar. But I know him and keep his word. <span
class="bibleverse">56</span> Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day.
He saw it and was glad.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">57</span> The Jews therefore said to him,
“You are not yet fifty years old! Have you seen Abraham?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">58</span> Jesus said to them, “Most
certainly, I tell you, before Abraham came into existence, I AM.<a
href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a> ”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">59</span> Therefore they took up stones to
throw at him, but Jesus hid himself and went out of the temple, having
gone through the middle of them, and so passed by.</p>
<h1 id="section-8">9</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> As he passed by, he saw a man blind
from birth. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> His disciples asked him,
“Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born
blind?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">3</span> Jesus answered, “This man didn’t
sin, nor did his parents, but that the works of God might be revealed in
him. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> I must work the works of him who
sent me while it is day. The night is coming, when no one can work.
<span class="bibleverse">5</span> While I am in the world, I am the
light of the world.” <span class="bibleverse">6</span> When he had said
this, he spat on the ground, made mud with the saliva, anointed the
blind man’s eyes with the mud, <span class="bibleverse">7</span> and
said to him, “Go, wash in the pool of Siloam” (which means “Sent”). So
he went away, washed, and came back seeing.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">8</span> Therefore the neighbors and those
who saw that he was blind before said, “Isn’t this he who sat and
begged?” <span class="bibleverse">9</span> Others were saying, “It is
he.” Still others were saying, “He looks like him.”</p>
<p>He said, “I am he.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">10</span> They therefore were asking him,
“How were your eyes opened?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">11</span> He answered, “A man called Jesus
made mud, anointed my eyes, and said to me, ‘Go to the pool of Siloam
and wash.’ So I went away and washed, and I received sight.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">12</span> Then they asked him, “Where is
he?”</p>
<p>He said, “I don’t know.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">13</span> They brought him who had been
blind to the Pharisees. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> It was a
Sabbath when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> Again therefore the Pharisees also asked
him how he received his sight. He said to them, “He put mud on my eyes,
I washed, and I see.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">16</span> Some therefore of the Pharisees
said, “This man is not from God, because he doesn’t keep the
Sabbath.”</p>
<p>Others said, “How can a man who is a sinner do such signs?” So there
was division among them.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">17</span> Therefore they asked the blind man
again, “What do you say about him, because he opened your eyes?”</p>
<p>He said, “He is a prophet.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">18</span> The Jews therefore didn’t believe
concerning him, that he had been blind and had received his sight, until
they called the parents of him who had received his sight, <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> and asked them, “Is this your son, whom you
say was born blind? How then does he now see?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">20</span> His parents answered them, “We
know that this is our son, and that he was born blind; <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> but how he now sees, we don’t know; or who
opened his eyes, we don’t know. He is of age. Ask him. He will speak for
himself.” <span class="bibleverse">22</span> His parents said these
things because they feared the Jews; for the Jews had already agreed
that if any man would confess him as Christ, he would be put out of the
synagogue. <span class="bibleverse">23</span> Therefore his parents
said, “He is of age. Ask him.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">24</span> So they called the man who was
blind a second time, and said to him, “Give glory to God. We know that
this man is a sinner.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">25</span> He therefore answered, “I don’t
know if he is a sinner. One thing I do know: that though I was blind,
now I see.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">26</span> They said to him again, “What did
he do to you? How did he open your eyes?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">27</span> He answered them, “I told you
already, and you didn’t listen. Why do you want to hear it again? You
don’t also want to become his disciples, do you?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">28</span> They insulted him and said, “You
are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses. <span
class="bibleverse">29</span> We know that God has spoken to Moses. But
as for this man, we don’t know where he comes from.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">30</span> The man answered them, “How
amazing! You don’t know where he comes from, yet he opened my eyes.
<span class="bibleverse">31</span> We know that God doesn’t listen to
sinners, but if anyone is a worshiper of God and does his will, he
listens to him.<a href="#fn39" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref39"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>39</sup></a> <span class="bibleverse">32</span>
Since the world began it has never been heard of that anyone opened the
eyes of someone born blind. <span class="bibleverse">33</span> If this
man were not from God, he could do nothing.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">34</span> They answered him, “You were
altogether born in sins, and do you teach us?” Then they threw him
out.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">35</span> Jesus heard that they had thrown
him out, and finding him, he said, “Do you believe in the Son of
God?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">36</span> He answered, “Who is he, Lord,
that I may believe in him?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">37</span> Jesus said to him, “You have both
seen him, and it is he who speaks with you.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">38</span> He said, “Lord, I believe!” and he
worshiped him.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">39</span> Jesus said, “I came into this
world for judgment, that those who don’t see may see; and that those who
see may become blind.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">40</span> Those of the Pharisees who were
with him heard these things, and said to him, “Are we also blind?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">41</span> Jesus said to them, “If you were
blind, you would have no sin; but now you say, ‘We see.’ Therefore your
sin remains.</p>
<h1 id="section-9">10</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> “Most certainly, I tell you, one
who doesn’t enter by the door into the sheep fold, but climbs up some
other way, is a thief and a robber. <span class="bibleverse">2</span>
But one who enters in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> The gatekeeper opens the gate for him, and
the sheep listen to his voice. He calls his own sheep by name and leads
them out. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> Whenever he brings out his
own sheep, he goes before them; and the sheep follow him, for they know
his voice. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> They will by no means
follow a stranger, but will flee from him; for they don’t know the voice
of strangers.” <span class="bibleverse">6</span> Jesus spoke this
parable to them, but they didn’t understand what he was telling
them.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">7</span> Jesus therefore said to them again,
“Most certainly, I tell you, I am the sheep’s door. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> All who came before me are thieves and
robbers, but the sheep didn’t listen to them. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> I am the door. If anyone enters in by me, he
will be saved, and will go in and go out and will find pasture. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> The thief only comes to steal, kill, and
destroy. I came that they may have life, and may have it abundantly.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">11</span> “I am the good shepherd.<a
href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a> The good shepherd lays down his
life for the sheep. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> He who is a hired
hand, and not a shepherd, who doesn’t own the sheep, sees the wolf
coming, leaves the sheep, and flees. The wolf snatches the sheep and
scatters them. <span class="bibleverse">13</span> The hired hand flees
because he is a hired hand and doesn’t care for the sheep. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> I am the good shepherd. I know my own, and
I’m known by my own; <span class="bibleverse">15</span> even as the
Father knows me, and I know the Father. I lay down my life for the
sheep. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> I have other sheep which are
not of this fold.<a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a> I must bring them also, and they
will hear my voice. They will become one flock with one shepherd. <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> Therefore the Father loves me, because I
lay down my life, <a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a> that I may take it again. <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> No one takes it away from me, but I lay it
down by myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it
again. I received this commandment from my Father.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">19</span> Therefore a division arose again
among the Jews because of these words. <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> Many of them said, “He has a demon and is
insane! Why do you listen to him?” <span class="bibleverse">21</span>
Others said, “These are not the sayings of one possessed by a demon. It
isn’t possible for a demon to open the eyes of the blind, is it?”<a
href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">22</span> It was the Feast of the
Dedication<a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a> at Jerusalem. <span
class="bibleverse">23</span> It was winter, and Jesus was walking in the
temple, in Solomon’s porch. <span class="bibleverse">24</span> The Jews
therefore came around him and said to him, “How long will you hold us in
suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">25</span> Jesus answered them, “I told you,
and you don’t believe. The works that I do in my Father’s name, these
testify about me. <span class="bibleverse">26</span> But you don’t
believe, because you are not of my sheep, as I told you. <span
class="bibleverse">27</span> My sheep hear my voice, and I know them,
and they follow me. <span class="bibleverse">28</span> I give eternal
life to them. They will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of
my hand. <span class="bibleverse">29</span> My Father who has given them
to me is greater than all. No one is able to snatch them out of my
Father’s hand. <span class="bibleverse">30</span> I and the Father are
one.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">31</span> Therefore the Jews took up stones
again to stone him. <span class="bibleverse">32</span> Jesus answered
them, “I have shown you many good works from my Father. For which of
those works do you stone me?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">33</span> The Jews answered him, “We don’t
stone you for a good work, but for blasphemy, because you, being a man,
make yourself God.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">34</span> Jesus answered them, “Isn’t it
written in your law, ‘I said, you are gods?’<a href="#fn45"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45" role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a>
<span class="bibleverse">35</span> If he called them gods, to whom the
word of God came (and the Scripture can’t be broken), <span
class="bibleverse">36</span> do you say of him whom the Father
sanctified and sent into the world, ‘You blaspheme,’ because I said, ‘I
am the Son of God?’ <span class="bibleverse">37</span> If I don’t do the
works of my Father, don’t believe me. <span class="bibleverse">38</span>
But if I do them, though you don’t believe me, believe the works, that
you may know and believe that the Father is in me, and I in the
Father.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">39</span> They sought again to seize him,
and he went out of their hand. <span class="bibleverse">40</span> He
went away again beyond the Jordan into the place where John was
baptizing at first, and he stayed there. <span
class="bibleverse">41</span> Many came to him. They said, “John indeed
did no sign, but everything that John said about this man is true.”
<span class="bibleverse">42</span> Many believed in him there.</p>
<h1 id="section-10">11</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus
from Bethany, of the village of Mary and her sister, Martha. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> It was that Mary who had anointed the Lord
with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus
was sick. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> The sisters therefore sent
to him, saying, “Lord, behold, he for whom you have great affection is
sick.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">4</span> But when Jesus heard it, he said,
“This sickness is not to death, but for the glory of God, that God’s Son
may be glorified by it.” <span class="bibleverse">5</span> Now Jesus
loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> When therefore he heard that he was sick, he
stayed two days in the place where he was. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> Then after this he said to the disciples,
“Let’s go into Judea again.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">8</span> The disciples asked him, “Rabbi,
the Jews were just trying to stone you. Are you going there again?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">9</span> Jesus answered, “Aren’t there
twelve hours of daylight? If a man walks in the day, he doesn’t stumble,
because he sees the light of this world. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> But if a man walks in the night, he
stumbles, because the light isn’t in him.” <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> He said these things, and after that, he
said to them, “Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I am going so
that I may awake him out of sleep.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">12</span> The disciples therefore said,
“Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">13</span> Now Jesus had spoken of his death,
but they thought that he spoke of taking rest in sleep. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> So Jesus said to them plainly then,
“Lazarus is dead. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> I am glad for your
sakes that I was not there, so that you may believe. Nevertheless, let’s
go to him.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">16</span> Thomas therefore, who is called
Didymus,<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a> said to his fellow disciples,
“Let’s also go, that we may die with him.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">17</span> So when Jesus came, he found that
he had been in the tomb four days already. <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about
fifteen stadia<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a> away. <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> Many of the Jews had joined the women
around Martha and Mary, to console them concerning their brother. <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> Then when Martha heard that Jesus was
coming, she went and met him, but Mary stayed in the house. <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> Therefore Martha said to Jesus, “Lord, if
you would have been here, my brother wouldn’t have died. <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> Even now I know that whatever you ask of
God, God will give you.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">23</span> Jesus said to her, “Your brother
will rise again.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">24</span> Martha said to him, “I know that
he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">25</span> Jesus said to her, “I am the
resurrection and the life. He who believes in me will still live, even
if he dies. <span class="bibleverse">26</span> Whoever lives and
believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">27</span> She said to him, “Yes, Lord. I
have come to believe that you are the Christ, God’s Son, he who comes
into the world.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">28</span> When she had said this, she went
away and called Mary, her sister, secretly, saying, “The Teacher is here
and is calling you.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">29</span> When she heard this, she arose
quickly and went to him. <span class="bibleverse">30</span> Now Jesus
had not yet come into the village, but was in the place where Martha met
him. <span class="bibleverse">31</span> Then the Jews who were with her
in the house and were consoling her, when they saw Mary, that she rose
up quickly and went out, followed her, saying, “She is going to the tomb
to weep there.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">32</span> Therefore when Mary came to where
Jesus was and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying to him, “Lord,
if you would have been here, my brother wouldn’t have died.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">33</span> When Jesus therefore saw her
weeping, and the Jews weeping who came with her, he groaned in the
spirit and was troubled, <span class="bibleverse">34</span> and said,
“Where have you laid him?”</p>
<p>They told him, “Lord, come and see.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">35</span> Jesus wept.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">36</span> The Jews therefore said, “See how
much affection he had for him!” <span class="bibleverse">37</span> Some
of them said, “Couldn’t this man, who opened the eyes of him who was
blind, have also kept this man from dying?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">38</span> Jesus therefore, again groaning in
himself, came to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone lay against
it. <span class="bibleverse">39</span> Jesus said, “Take away the
stone.”</p>
<p>Martha, the sister of him who was dead, said to him, “Lord, by this
time there is a stench, for he has been dead four days.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">40</span> Jesus said to her, “Didn’t I tell
you that if you believed, you would see God’s glory?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">41</span> So they took away the stone from
the place where the dead man was lying.<a href="#fn48"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48" role="doc-noteref"><sup>48</sup></a>
Jesus lifted up his eyes and said, “Father, I thank you that you
listened to me. <span class="bibleverse">42</span> I know that you
always listen to me, but because of the multitude standing around I said
this, that they may believe that you sent me.” <span
class="bibleverse">43</span> When he had said this, he cried with a loud
voice, “Lazarus, come out!”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">44</span> He who was dead came out, bound
hand and foot with wrappings, and his face was wrapped around with a
cloth.</p>
<p>Jesus said to them, “Free him, and let him go.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">45</span> Therefore many of the Jews who
came to Mary and saw what Jesus did believed in him. <span
class="bibleverse">46</span> But some of them went away to the Pharisees
and told them the things which Jesus had done. <span
class="bibleverse">47</span> The chief priests therefore and the
Pharisees gathered a council, and said, “What are we doing? For this man
does many signs. <span class="bibleverse">48</span> If we leave him
alone like this, everyone will believe in him, and the Romans will come
and take away both our place and our nation.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">49</span> But a certain one of them,
Caiaphas, being high priest that year, said to them, “You know nothing
at all, <span class="bibleverse">50</span> nor do you consider that it
is advantageous for us that one man should die for the people, and that
the whole nation not perish.” <span class="bibleverse">51</span> Now he
didn’t say this of himself, but being high priest that year, he
prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation, <span
class="bibleverse">52</span> and not for the nation only, but that he
might also gather together into one the children of God who are
scattered abroad. <span class="bibleverse">53</span> So from that day
forward they took counsel that they might put him to death. <span
class="bibleverse">54</span> Jesus therefore walked no more openly among
the Jews, but departed from there into the country near the wilderness,
to a city called Ephraim. He stayed there with his disciples.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">55</span> Now the Passover of the Jews was
at hand. Many went up from the country to Jerusalem before the Passover,
to purify themselves. <span class="bibleverse">56</span> Then they
sought for Jesus and spoke with one another as they stood in the temple,
“What do you think—that he isn’t coming to the feast at all?” <span
class="bibleverse">57</span> Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had
commanded that if anyone knew where he was, he should report it, that
they might seize him.</p>
<h1 id="section-11">12</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Then, six days before the Passover,
Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, who had been dead, whom he
raised from the dead. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> So they made him
a supper there. Martha served, but Lazarus was one of those who sat at
the table with him. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> Therefore Mary
took a pound<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>49</sup></a> of ointment of pure nard, very
precious, and anointed Jesus’s feet and wiped his feet with her hair.
The house was filled with the fragrance of the ointment.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">4</span> Then Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son,
one of his disciples, who would betray him, said, <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> “Why wasn’t this ointment sold for three
hundred denarii<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>50</sup></a> and given to the poor?” <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> Now he said this, not because he cared for
the poor, but because he was a thief, and having the money box, used to
steal what was put into it.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">7</span> But Jesus said, “Leave her alone.
She has kept this for the day of my burial. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> For you always have the poor with you, but
you don’t always have me.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">9</span> A large crowd therefore of the Jews
learned that he was there; and they came, not for Jesus’ sake only, but
that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.
<span class="bibleverse">10</span> But the chief priests conspired to
put Lazarus to death also, <span class="bibleverse">11</span> because on
account of him many of the Jews went away and believed in Jesus.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">12</span> On the next day a great multitude
had come to the feast. When they heard that Jesus was coming to
Jerusalem, <span class="bibleverse">13</span> they took the branches of
the palm trees and went out to meet him, and cried out, “Hosanna!<a
href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>51</sup></a> Blessed is he who comes in the name
of the Lord,<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>52</sup></a> the King of Israel!”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">14</span> Jesus, having found a young
donkey, sat on it. As it is written, <span class="bibleverse">15</span>
“Don’t be afraid, daughter of Zion. Behold, your King comes, sitting on
a donkey’s colt.”<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>53</sup></a> <span class="bibleverse">16</span>
His disciples didn’t understand these things at first, but when Jesus
was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written about
him, and that they had done these things to him. <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> The multitude therefore that was with him
when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead was
testifying about it. <span class="bibleverse">18</span> For this cause
also the multitude went and met him, because they heard that he had done
this sign. <span class="bibleverse">19</span> The Pharisees therefore
said among themselves, “See how you accomplish nothing. Behold, the
world has gone after him.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">20</span> Now there were certain Greeks
among those who went up to worship at the feast. <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> Therefore, these came to Philip, who was
from Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, “Sir, we want to see
Jesus.” <span class="bibleverse">22</span> Philip came and told Andrew,
and in turn, Andrew came with Philip, and they told Jesus.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">23</span> Jesus answered them, “The time has
come for the Son of Man to be glorified. <span
class="bibleverse">24</span> Most certainly I tell you, unless a grain
of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains by itself alone. But
if it dies, it bears much fruit. <span class="bibleverse">25</span> He
who loves his life will lose it. He who hates his life in this world
will keep it to eternal life. <span class="bibleverse">26</span> If
anyone serves me, let him follow me. Where I am, there my servant will
also be. If anyone serves me, the Father will honor him.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">27</span> “Now my soul is troubled. What
shall I say? ‘Father, save me from this time?’ But I came to this time
for this cause. <span class="bibleverse">28</span> Father, glorify your
name!”</p>
<p>Then a voice came out of the sky, saying, “I have both glorified it
and will glorify it again.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">29</span> Therefore the multitude who stood
by and heard it said that it had thundered. Others said, “An angel has
spoken to him.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">30</span> Jesus answered, “This voice hasn’t
come for my sake, but for your sakes. <span class="bibleverse">31</span>
Now is the judgment of this world. Now the prince of this world will be
cast out. <span class="bibleverse">32</span> And I, if I am lifted up
from the earth, will draw all people to myself.” <span
class="bibleverse">33</span> But he said this, signifying by what kind
of death he should die.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">34</span> The multitude answered him, “We
have heard out of the law that the Christ remains forever.<a
href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>54</sup></a> How do you say, ‘The Son of Man
must be lifted up?’ Who is this Son of Man?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">35</span> Jesus therefore said to them, “Yet
a little while the light is with you. Walk while you have the light,
that darkness doesn’t overtake you. He who walks in the darkness doesn’t
know where he is going. <span class="bibleverse">36</span> While you
have the light, believe in the light, that you may become children of
light.” Jesus said these things, and he departed and hid himself from
them. <span class="bibleverse">37</span> But though he had done so many
signs before them, yet they didn’t believe in him, <span
class="bibleverse">38</span> that the word of Isaiah the prophet might
be fulfilled, which he spoke: “Lord, who has believed our report? To
whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?”<a href="#fn55"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">39</span> For this cause they couldn’t
believe, for Isaiah said again: <span class="bibleverse">40</span> “He
has blinded their eyes and he hardened their heart, lest they should see
with their eyes, and perceive with their heart, and would turn, and I
would heal them.”<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>56</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">41</span> Isaiah said these things when he
saw his glory, and spoke of him. <a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref57" role="doc-noteref"><sup>57</sup></a> <span
class="bibleverse">42</span> Nevertheless, even many of the rulers
believed in him, but because of the Pharisees they didn’t confess it, so
that they wouldn’t be put out of the synagogue, <span
class="bibleverse">43</span> for they loved men’s praise more than God’s
praise.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">44</span> Jesus cried out and said, “Whoever
believes in me, believes not in me, but in him who sent me. <span
class="bibleverse">45</span> He who sees me sees him who sent me. <span
class="bibleverse">46</span> I have come as a light into the world, that
whoever believes in me may not remain in the darkness. <span
class="bibleverse">47</span> If anyone listens to my sayings and doesn’t
believe, I don’t judge him. For I came not to judge the world, but to
save the world. <span class="bibleverse">48</span> He who rejects me,
and doesn’t receive my sayings, has one who judges him. The word that I
spoke will judge him in the last day. <span class="bibleverse">49</span>
For I spoke not from myself, but the Father who sent me gave me a
commandment, what I should say and what I should speak. <span
class="bibleverse">50</span> I know that his commandment is eternal
life. The things therefore which I speak, even as the Father has said to
me, so I speak.”</p>
<h1 id="section-12">13</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Now before the feast of the
Passover, Jesus, knowing that his time had come that he would depart
from this world to the Father, having loved his own who were in the
world, he loved them to the end. <span class="bibleverse">2</span>
During supper, the devil having already put into the heart of Judas
Iscariot, Simon’s son, to betray him, <span class="bibleverse">3</span>
Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and
that he came from God and was going to God, <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> arose from supper, and laid aside his outer
garments. He took a towel and wrapped a towel around his waist. <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> Then he poured water into the basin, and
began to wash the disciples’ feet and to wipe them with the towel that
was wrapped around him. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> Then he came
to Simon Peter. He said to him, “Lord, do you wash my feet?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">7</span> Jesus answered him, “You don’t know
what I am doing now, but you will understand later.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">8</span> Peter said to him, “You will never
wash my feet!”</p>
<p>Jesus answered him, “If I don’t wash you, you have no part with
me.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">9</span> Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, not
my feet only, but also my hands and my head!”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">10</span> Jesus said to him, “Someone who
has bathed only needs to have his feet washed, but is completely clean.
You are clean, but not all of you.” <span class="bibleverse">11</span>
For he knew him who would betray him; therefore he said, “You are not
all clean.” <span class="bibleverse">12</span> So when he had washed
their feet, put his outer garment back on, and sat down again, he said
to them, “Do you know what I have done to you? <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> You call me, ‘Teacher’ and ‘Lord.’ You say
so correctly, for so I am. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> If I then,
the Lord and the Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash
one another’s feet. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> For I have given
you an example, that you should also do as I have done to you. <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> Most certainly I tell you, a servant is not
greater than his lord, neither is one who is sent greater than he who
sent him. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> If you know these things,
blessed are you if you do them. <span class="bibleverse">18</span> I
don’t speak concerning all of you. I know whom I have chosen; but that
the Scripture may be fulfilled, ‘He who eats bread with me has lifted up
his heel against me.’<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>58</sup></a> <span class="bibleverse">19</span>
From now on, I tell you before it happens, that when it happens, you may
believe that I am he. <span class="bibleverse">20</span> Most certainly
I tell you, he who receives whomever I send, receives me; and he who
receives me, receives him who sent me.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">21</span> When Jesus had said this, he was
troubled in spirit, and testified, “Most certainly I tell you that one
of you will betray me.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">22</span> The disciples looked at one
another, perplexed about whom he spoke. <span
class="bibleverse">23</span> One of his disciples, whom Jesus loved, was
at the table, leaning against Jesus’ breast. <span
class="bibleverse">24</span> Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, and
said to him, “Tell us who it is of whom he speaks.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">25</span> He, leaning back, as he was, on
Jesus’ breast, asked him, “Lord, who is it?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">26</span> Jesus therefore answered, “It is
he to whom I will give this piece of bread when I have dipped it.” So
when he had dipped the piece of bread, he gave it to Judas, the son of
Simon Iscariot. <span class="bibleverse">27</span> After the piece of
bread, then Satan entered into him.</p>
<p>Then Jesus said to him, “What you do, do quickly.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">28</span> Now nobody at the table knew why
he said this to him. <span class="bibleverse">29</span> For some
thought, because Judas had the money box, that Jesus said to him, “Buy
what things we need for the feast,” or that he should give something to
the poor. <span class="bibleverse">30</span> Therefore having received
that morsel, he went out immediately. It was night.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">31</span> When he had gone out, Jesus said,
“Now the Son of Man has been glorified, and God has been glorified in
him. <span class="bibleverse">32</span> If God has been glorified in
him, God will also glorify him in himself, and he will glorify him
immediately. <span class="bibleverse">33</span> Little children, I will
be with you a little while longer. You will seek me, and as I said to
the Jews, ‘Where I am going, you can’t come,’ so now I tell you. <span
class="bibleverse">34</span> A new commandment I give to you, that you
love one another. Just as I have loved you, you also love one another.
<span class="bibleverse">35</span> By this everyone will know that you
are my disciples, if you have love for one another.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">36</span> Simon Peter said to him, “Lord,
where are you going?”</p>
<p>Jesus answered, “Where I am going, you can’t follow now, but you will
follow afterwards.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">37</span> Peter said to him, “Lord, why
can’t I follow you now? I will lay down my life for you.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">38</span> Jesus answered him, “Will you lay
down your life for me? Most certainly I tell you, the rooster won’t crow
until you have denied me three times.</p>
<h1 id="section-13">14</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> “Don’t let your heart be troubled.
Believe in God. Believe also in me. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> In
my Father’s house are many homes. If it weren’t so, I would have told
you. I am going to prepare a place for you. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> If I go and prepare a place for you, I will
come again and will receive you to myself; that where I am, you may be
there also. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> You know where I go, and
you know the way.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">5</span> Thomas said to him, “Lord, we don’t
know where you are going. How can we know the way?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">6</span> Jesus said to him, “I am the way,
the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father, except through me.
<span class="bibleverse">7</span> If you had known me, you would have
known my Father also. From now on, you know him and have seen him.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">8</span> Philip said to him, “Lord, show us
the Father, and that will be enough for us.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">9</span> Jesus said to him, “Have I been
with you such a long time, and do you not know me, Philip? He who has
seen me has seen the Father. How do you say, ‘Show us the Father?’ <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> Don’t you believe that I am in the Father,
and the Father in me? The words that I tell you, I speak not from
myself; but the Father who lives in me does his works. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> Believe me that I am in the Father, and the
Father in me; or else believe me for the very works’ sake. <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> Most certainly I tell you, he who believes
in me, the works that I do, he will do also; and he will do greater
works than these, because I am going to my Father. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> Whatever you will ask in my name, I will do
it, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> If you will ask anything in my name, I will
do it. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> If you love me, keep my
commandments. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> I will pray to the
Father, and he will give you another Counselor, <a href="#fn59"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59" role="doc-noteref"><sup>59</sup></a>
that he may be with you forever: <span class="bibleverse">17</span> the
Spirit of truth, whom the world can’t receive, for it doesn’t see him
and doesn’t know him. You know him, for he lives with you and will be in
you. <span class="bibleverse">18</span> I will not leave you orphans. I
will come to you. <span class="bibleverse">19</span> Yet a little while,
and the world will see me no more; but you will see me. Because I live,
you will live also. <span class="bibleverse">20</span> In that day you
will know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you. <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> One who has my commandments and keeps them,
that person is one who loves me. One who loves me will be loved by my
Father, and I will love him, and will reveal myself to him.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">22</span> Judas (not Iscariot) said to him,
“Lord, what has happened that you are about to reveal yourself to us,
and not to the world?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">23</span> Jesus answered him, “If a man
loves me, he will keep my word. My Father will love him, and we will
come to him and make our home with him. <span
class="bibleverse">24</span> He who doesn’t love me doesn’t keep my
words. The word which you hear isn’t mine, but the Father’s who sent
me.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">25</span> “I have said these things to you
while still living with you. <span class="bibleverse">26</span> But the
Counselor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will
teach you all things, and will remind you of all that I said to you.
<span class="bibleverse">27</span> Peace I leave with you. My peace I
give to you; not as the world gives, I give to you. Don’t let your heart
be troubled, neither let it be fearful. <span
class="bibleverse">28</span> You heard how I told you, ‘I am going away,
and I will come back to you.’ If you loved me, you would have rejoiced
because I said ‘I am going to my Father;’ for the Father is greater than
I. <span class="bibleverse">29</span> Now I have told you before it
happens so that when it happens, you may believe. <span
class="bibleverse">30</span> I will no more speak much with you, for the
prince of the world comes, and he has nothing in me. <span
class="bibleverse">31</span> But that the world may know that I love the
Father, and as the Father commanded me, even so I do. Arise, let’s go
from here.</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> “I am the true vine, and my Father
is the farmer. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> Every branch in me that
doesn’t bear fruit, he takes away. Every branch that bears fruit, he
prunes, that it may bear more fruit. <span class="bibleverse">3</span>
You are already pruned clean because of the word which I have spoken to
you. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> Remain in me, and I in you. As
the branch can’t bear fruit by itself unless it remains in the vine, so
neither can you, unless you remain in me. <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> I am the vine. You are the branches. He who
remains in me and I in him bears much fruit, for apart from me you can
do nothing. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> If a man doesn’t remain in
me, he is thrown out as a branch and is withered; and they gather them,
throw them into the fire, and they are burned. <span

you, you will ask whatever you desire, and it will be done for you.</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">12</span> “This is my commandment, that you

someone lay down his life for his friends. <span

command you. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> No longer do I call you
servants, for the servant doesn’t know what his lord does. But I have
called you friends, for everything that I heard from my Father, I have
made known to you. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> You didn’t choose
me, but I chose you and appointed you, that you should go and bear
fruit, and that your fruit should remain; that whatever you will ask of
the Father in my name, he may give it to you.</p>

world hates you, you know that it has hated me before it hated you.

would love its own. But because you are not of the world, since I chose
you out of the world, therefore the world hates you. <span

servant is not greater than his lord.’<a href="#fn60"

don’t know him who sent me. <span class="bibleverse">22</span> If I had
not come and spoken to them, they would not have had sin; but now they
have no excuse for their sin. <span class="bibleverse">23</span> He who
hates me, hates my Father also. <span class="bibleverse">24</span> If I
hadn’t done among them the works which no one else did, they wouldn’t
have had sin. But now they have seen and also hated both me and my

<p><span class="bibleverse">12</span> “I still have many things to tell
you, but you can’t bear them now. <span class="bibleverse">13</span>
However, when he, the Spirit of truth, has come, he will guide you into
all truth, for he will not speak from himself; but whatever he hears, he
will speak. He will declare to you things that are coming. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> He will glorify me, for he will take from
what is mine and will declare it to you. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> All things that the Father has are mine;
therefore I said that he takes<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref64" role="doc-noteref"><sup>64</sup></a> of mine and will
declare it to you.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">16</span> “A little while, and you will not
see me. Again a little while, and you will see me.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">17</span> Some of his disciples therefore
said to one another, “What is this that he says to us, ‘A little while,
and you won’t see me, and again a little while, and you will see me;’
and, ‘Because I go to the Father’?” <span class="bibleverse">18</span>
They said therefore, “What is this that he says, ‘A little while’? We
don’t know what he is saying.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">19</span> Therefore Jesus perceived that
they wanted to ask him, and he said to them, “Do you inquire among
yourselves concerning this, that I said, ‘A little while, and you won’t
see me, and again a little while, and you will see me?’ <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> Most certainly I tell you that you will
weep and lament, but the world will rejoice. You will be sorrowful, but
your sorrow will be turned into joy. <span class="bibleverse">21</span>
A woman, when she gives birth, has sorrow because her time has come. But
when she has delivered the child, she doesn’t remember the anguish any
more, for the joy that a human being is born into the world. <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> Therefore you now have sorrow, but I will
see you again, and your heart will rejoice, and no one will take your
joy away from you.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">23</span> “In that day you will ask me no
questions. Most certainly I tell you, whatever you may ask of the Father
in my name, he will give it to you. <span class="bibleverse">24</span>
Until now, you have asked nothing in my name. Ask, and you will receive,
that your joy may be made full.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">25</span> “I have spoken these things to you
in figures of speech. But the time is coming when I will no more speak
to you in figures of speech, but will tell you plainly about the Father.
<span class="bibleverse">26</span> In that day you will ask in my name;
and I don’t say to you that I will pray to the Father for you, <span
class="bibleverse">27</span> for the Father himself loves you, because
you have loved me, and have believed that I came from God. <span
class="bibleverse">28</span> I came from the Father and have come into
the world. Again, I leave the world and go to the Father.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">29</span> His disciples said to him,
“Behold, now you are speaking plainly, and using no figures of speech.
<span class="bibleverse">30</span> Now we know that you know all things,
and don’t need for anyone to question you. By this we believe that you
came from God.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">31</span> Jesus answered them, “Do you now
believe? <span class="bibleverse">32</span> Behold, the time is coming,
yes, and has now come, that you will be scattered, everyone to his own
place, and you will leave me alone. Yet I am not alone, because the
Father is with me. <span class="bibleverse">33</span> I have told you
these things, that in me you may have peace. In the world you have
trouble; but cheer up! I have overcome the world.”</p>
<h1 id="section-16">17</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Jesus said these things, then
lifting up his eyes to heaven, he said, “Father, the time has come.
Glorify your Son, that your Son may also glorify you; <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> even as you gave him authority over all
flesh, so he will give eternal life to all whom you have given him.
<span class="bibleverse">3</span> This is eternal life, that they should
know you, the only true God, and him whom you sent, Jesus Christ. <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> I glorified you on the earth. I have
accomplished the work which you have given me to do. <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> Now, Father, glorify me with your own self
with the glory which I had with you before the world existed.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">6</span> “I revealed your name to the people
whom you have given me out of the world. They were yours, and you have
given them to me. They have kept your word. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> Now they have known that all things whatever
you have given me are from you, <span class="bibleverse">8</span> for
the words which you have given me I have given to them; and they
received them, and knew for sure that I came from you. They have
believed that you sent me. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> I pray for
them. I don’t pray for the world, but for those whom you have given me,
for they are yours. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> All things that
are mine are yours, and yours are mine, and I am glorified in them.
<span class="bibleverse">11</span> I am no more in the world, but these
are in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, keep them through
your name which you have given me, that they may be one, even as we are.
<span class="bibleverse">12</span> While I was with them in the world, I
kept them in your name. I have kept those whom you have given me. None
of them is lost except the son of destruction, that the Scripture might
be fulfilled. <span class="bibleverse">13</span> But now I come to you,
and I say these things in the world, that they may have my joy made full
in themselves. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> I have given them your
word. The world hated them because they are not of the world, even as I
am not of the world. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> I pray not that
you would take them from the world, but that you would keep them from
the evil one. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> They are not of the
world, even as I am not of the world. <span class="bibleverse">17</span>
Sanctify them in your truth. Your word is truth.<a href="#fn65"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65" role="doc-noteref"><sup>65</sup></a>
<span class="bibleverse">18</span> As you sent me into the world, even
so I have sent them into the world. <span class="bibleverse">19</span>
For their sakes I sanctify myself, that they themselves also may be
sanctified in truth.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">20</span> “Not for these only do I pray, but
for those also who will believe in me through their word, <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> that they may all be one; even as you,
Father, are in me, and I in you, that they also may be one in us; that
the world may believe that you sent me. <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> The glory which you have given me, I have
given to them, that they may be one, even as we are one, <span
class="bibleverse">23</span> I in them, and you in me, that they may be
perfected into one, that the world may know that you sent me and loved
them, even as you loved me. <span class="bibleverse">24</span> Father, I
desire that they also whom you have given me be with me where I am, that
they may see my glory which you have given me, for you loved me before
the foundation of the world. <span class="bibleverse">25</span>
Righteous Father, the world hasn’t known you, but I knew you; and these
knew that you sent me. <span class="bibleverse">26</span> I made known
to them your name, and will make it known; that the love with which you
loved me may be in them, and I in them.”</p>
<h1 id="section-17">18</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> When Jesus had spoken these words,
he went out with his disciples over the brook Kidron, where there was a
garden, into which he and his disciples entered. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> Now Judas, who betrayed him, also knew the
place, for Jesus often met there with his disciples. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> Judas then, having taken a detachment of
soldiers and officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees, came
there with lanterns, torches, and weapons. <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> Jesus therefore, knowing all the things that
were happening to him, went out and said to them, “Who are you looking
for?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">5</span> They answered him, “Jesus of
Nazareth.”</p>
<p>Jesus said to them, “I am he.”</p>
<p>Judas also, who betrayed him, was standing with them. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> When therefore he said to them, “I am he,”
they went backward and fell to the ground.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">7</span> Again therefore he asked them, “Who
are you looking for?”</p>
<p>They said, “Jesus of Nazareth.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">8</span> Jesus answered, “I told you that I
am he. If therefore you seek me, let these go their way,” <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> that the word might be fulfilled which he
spoke, “Of those whom you have given me, I have lost none.”<a
href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>66</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">10</span> Simon Peter therefore, having a
sword, drew it, struck the high priest’s servant, and cut off his right
ear. The servant’s name was Malchus. <span class="bibleverse">11</span>
Jesus therefore said to Peter, “Put the sword into its sheath. The cup
which the Father has given me, shall I not surely drink it?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">12</span> So the detachment, the commanding
officer, and the officers of the Jews seized Jesus and bound him, <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> and led him to Annas first, for he was
father-in-law to Caiaphas, who was high priest that year. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> Now it was Caiaphas who advised the Jews
that it was expedient that one man should perish for the people.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">15</span> Simon Peter followed Jesus, as did
another disciple. Now that disciple was known to the high priest, and
entered in with Jesus into the court of the high priest; <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> but Peter was standing at the door outside.
So the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and
spoke to her who kept the door, and brought in Peter. <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> Then the maid who kept the door said to
Peter, “Are you also one of this man’s disciples?”</p>
<p>He said, “I am not.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">18</span> Now the servants and the officers
were standing there, having made a fire of coals, for it was cold. They
were warming themselves. Peter was with them, standing and warming
himself.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">19</span> The high priest therefore asked
Jesus about his disciples and about his teaching.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">20</span> Jesus answered him, “I spoke
openly to the world. I always taught in synagogues and in the temple,
where the Jews always meet. I said nothing in secret. <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> Why do you ask me? Ask those who have heard
me what I said to them. Behold, they know the things which I said.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">22</span> When he had said this, one of the
officers standing by slapped Jesus with his hand, saying, “Do you answer
the high priest like that?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">23</span> Jesus answered him, “If I have
spoken evil, testify of the evil; but if well, why do you beat me?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">24</span> Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas,
the high priest.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">25</span> Now Simon Peter was standing and
warming himself. They said therefore to him, “You aren’t also one of his
disciples, are you?”</p>
<p>He denied it and said, “I am not.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">26</span> One of the servants of the high
priest, being a relative of him whose ear Peter had cut off, said,
“Didn’t I see you in the garden with him?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">27</span> Peter therefore denied it again,
and immediately the rooster crowed.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">28</span> They led Jesus therefore from
Caiaphas into the Praetorium. It was early, and they themselves didn’t
enter into the Praetorium, that they might not be defiled, but might eat
the Passover. <span class="bibleverse">29</span> Pilate therefore went
out to them and said, “What accusation do you bring against this
man?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">30</span> They answered him, “If this man
weren’t an evildoer, we wouldn’t have delivered him up to you.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">31</span> Pilate therefore said to them,
“Take him yourselves, and judge him according to your law.”</p>
<p>Therefore the Jews said to him, “It is illegal for us to put anyone
to death,” <span class="bibleverse">32</span> that the word of Jesus
might be fulfilled, which he spoke, signifying by what kind of death he
should die.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">33</span> Pilate therefore entered again
into the Praetorium, called Jesus, and said to him, “Are you the King of
the Jews?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">34</span> Jesus answered him, “Do you say
this by yourself, or did others tell you about me?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">35</span> Pilate answered, “I’m not a Jew,
am I? Your own nation and the chief priests delivered you to me. What
have you done?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">36</span> Jesus answered, “My Kingdom is not
of this world. If my Kingdom were of this world, then my servants would
fight, that I wouldn’t be delivered to the Jews. But now my Kingdom is
not from here.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">37</span> Pilate therefore said to him, “Are
you a king then?”</p>
<p>Jesus answered, “You say that I am a king. For this reason I have
been born, and for this reason I have come into the world, that I should
testify to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth listens to my
voice.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">38</span> Pilate said to him, “What is
truth?”</p>
<p>When he had said this, he went out again to the Jews, and said to
them, “I find no basis for a charge against him. <span
class="bibleverse">39</span> But you have a custom that I should release
someone to you at the Passover. Therefore, do you want me to release to
you the King of the Jews?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">40</span> Then they all shouted again,
saying, “Not this man, but Barabbas!” Now Barabbas was a robber.</p>
<h1 id="section-18">19</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> So Pilate then took Jesus and
flogged him. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> The soldiers twisted
thorns into a crown and put it on his head, and dressed him in a purple
garment. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> They kept saying, “Hail, King
of the Jews!” and they kept slapping him.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">4</span> Then Pilate went out again, and
said to them, “Behold, I bring him out to you, that you may know that I
find no basis for a charge against him.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">5</span> Jesus therefore came out, wearing
the crown of thorns and the purple garment. Pilate said to them,
“Behold, the man!”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">6</span> When therefore the chief priests
and the officers saw him, they shouted, saying, “Crucify! Crucify!”</p>
<p>Pilate said to them, “Take him yourselves and crucify him, for I find
no basis for a charge against him.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">7</span> The Jews answered him, “We have a
law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of
God.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">8</span> When therefore Pilate heard this
saying, he was more afraid. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> He entered
into the Praetorium again, and said to Jesus, “Where are you from?” But
Jesus gave him no answer. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> Pilate
therefore said to him, “Aren’t you speaking to me? Don’t you know that I
have power to release you and have power to crucify you?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">11</span> Jesus answered, “You would have no
power at all against me, unless it were given to you from above.
Therefore he who delivered me to you has greater sin.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">12</span> At this, Pilate was seeking to
release him, but the Jews cried out, saying, “If you release this man,
you aren’t Caesar’s friend! Everyone who makes himself a king speaks
against Caesar!”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">13</span> When Pilate therefore heard these
words, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judgment seat at a place
called “The Pavement”, but in Hebrew, “Gabbatha.” <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> Now it was the Preparation Day of the
Passover, at about the sixth hour.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref67" role="doc-noteref"><sup>67</sup></a> He said to the Jews,
“Behold, your King!”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">15</span> They cried out, “Away with him!
Away with him! Crucify him!”</p>
<p>Pilate said to them, “Shall I crucify your King?”</p>
<p>The chief priests answered, “We have no king but Caesar!”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">16</span> So then he delivered him to them
to be crucified. So they took Jesus and led him away. <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> He went out, bearing his cross, to the
place called “The Place of a Skull”, which is called in Hebrew,
“Golgotha”, <span class="bibleverse">18</span> where they crucified him,
and with him two others, on either side one, and Jesus in the middle.
<span class="bibleverse">19</span> Pilate wrote a title also, and put it
on the cross. There was written, “JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE
JEWS.” <span class="bibleverse">20</span> Therefore many of the Jews
read this title, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the
city; and it was written in Hebrew, in Latin, and in Greek. <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> The chief priests of the Jews therefore
said to Pilate, “Don’t write, ‘The King of the Jews,’ but, ‘he said, “I
am King of the Jews.”’”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">22</span> Pilate answered, “What I have
written, I have written.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">23</span> Then the soldiers, when they had
crucified Jesus, took his garments and made four parts, to every soldier
a part; and also the tunic. Now the tunic was without seam, woven from
the top throughout. <span class="bibleverse">24</span> Then they said to
one another, “Let’s not tear it, but cast lots for it to decide whose it
will be,” that the Scripture might be fulfilled, which says, “They
parted my garments among them. They cast lots for my clothing.”<a
href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>68</sup></a> Therefore the soldiers did these
things.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">25</span> But standing by Jesus’ cross were
his mother, his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary
Magdalene. <span class="bibleverse">26</span> Therefore when Jesus saw
his mother, and the disciple whom he loved standing there, he said to
his mother, “Woman, behold, your son!” <span
class="bibleverse">27</span> Then he said to the disciple, “Behold, your
mother!” From that hour, the disciple took her to his own home.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">28</span> After this, Jesus, seeing<a
href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>69</sup></a> that all things were now finished,
that the Scripture might be fulfilled, said, “I am thirsty!” <span
class="bibleverse">29</span> Now a vessel full of vinegar was set there;
so they put a sponge full of the vinegar on hyssop, and held it at his
mouth. <span class="bibleverse">30</span> When Jesus therefore had
received the vinegar, he said, “It is finished!” Then he bowed his head
and gave up his spirit.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">31</span> Therefore the Jews, because it was
the Preparation Day, so that the bodies wouldn’t remain on the cross on
the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a special one), asked of Pilate that
their legs might be broken and that they might be taken away. <span
class="bibleverse">32</span> Therefore the soldiers came and broke the
legs of the first and of the other who was crucified with him; <span
class="bibleverse">33</span> but when they came to Jesus and saw that he
was already dead, they didn’t break his legs. <span
class="bibleverse">34</span> However, one of the soldiers pierced his
side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out. <span
class="bibleverse">35</span> He who has seen has testified, and his
testimony is true. He knows that he tells the truth, that you may
believe. <span class="bibleverse">36</span> For these things happened
that the Scripture might be fulfilled, “A bone of him will not be
broken.”<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>70</sup></a> <span class="bibleverse">37</span>
Again another Scripture says, “They will look on him whom they
pierced.”<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>71</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">38</span> After these things, Joseph of
Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the
Jews, asked of Pilate that he might take away Jesus’ body. Pilate gave
him permission. He came therefore and took away his body. <span
class="bibleverse">39</span> Nicodemus, who at first came to Jesus by
night, also came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred
Roman pounds.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>72</sup></a> <span class="bibleverse">40</span>
So they took Jesus’ body, and bound it in linen cloths with the spices,
as the custom of the Jews is to bury. <span class="bibleverse">41</span>
Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden. In the
garden was a new tomb in which no man had ever yet been laid. <span
class="bibleverse">42</span> Then, because of the Jews’ Preparation Day
(for the tomb was near at hand), they laid Jesus there.</p>
<h1 id="section-19">20</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Now on the first day of the week,
Mary Magdalene went early, while it was still dark, to the tomb, and saw
that the stone had been taken away from the tomb. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> Therefore she ran and came to Simon Peter
and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and said to them, “They have
taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we don’t know where they have
laid him!”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">3</span> Therefore Peter and the other
disciple went out, and they went toward the tomb. <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> They both ran together. The other disciple
outran Peter and came to the tomb first. <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> Stooping and looking in, he saw the linen
cloths lying there; yet he didn’t enter in. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> Then Simon Peter came, following him, and
entered into the tomb. He saw the linen cloths lying, <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> and the cloth that had been on his head, not
lying with the linen cloths, but rolled up in a place by itself. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> So then the other disciple who came first to
the tomb also entered in, and he saw and believed. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> For as yet they didn’t know the Scripture,
that he must rise from the dead. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> So
the disciples went away again to their own homes.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">11</span> But Mary was standing outside at
the tomb weeping. So as she wept, she stooped and looked into the tomb,
<span class="bibleverse">12</span> and she saw two angels in white
sitting, one at the head and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus
had lain. <span class="bibleverse">13</span> They asked her, “Woman, why
are you weeping?”</p>
<p>She said to them, “Because they have taken away my Lord, and I don’t
know where they have laid him.” <span class="bibleverse">14</span> When
she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing, and didn’t
know that it was Jesus.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">15</span> Jesus said to her, “Woman, why are
you weeping? Who are you looking for?”</p>
<p>She, supposing him to be the gardener, said to him, “Sir, if you have
carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him
away.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">16</span> Jesus said to her, “Mary.”</p>
<p>She turned and said to him, “Rabboni!”<a href="#fn73"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73" role="doc-noteref"><sup>73</sup></a>
which is to say, “Teacher!”<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref74" role="doc-noteref"><sup>74</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">17</span> Jesus said to her, “Don’t hold me,
for I haven’t yet ascended to my Father; but go to my brothers and tell
them, ‘I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your
God.’”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">18</span> Mary Magdalene came and told the
disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that he had said these things
to her. <span class="bibleverse">19</span> When therefore it was evening
on that day, the first day of the week, and when the doors were locked
where the disciples were assembled, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and
stood in the middle and said to them, “Peace be to you.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">20</span> When he had said this, he showed
them his hands and his side. The disciples therefore were glad when they
saw the Lord. <span class="bibleverse">21</span> Jesus therefore said to
them again, “Peace be to you. As the Father has sent me, even so I send
you.” <span class="bibleverse">22</span> When he had said this, he
breathed on them, and said to them, “Receive the Holy Spirit! <span
class="bibleverse">23</span> If you forgive anyone’s sins, they have
been forgiven them. If you retain anyone’s sins, they have been
retained.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">24</span> But Thomas, one of the twelve,
called Didymus,<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>75</sup></a> wasn’t with them when Jesus came.
<span class="bibleverse">25</span> The other disciples therefore said to
him, “We have seen the Lord!”</p>
<p>But he said to them, “Unless I see in his hands the print of the
nails, put my finger into the print of the nails, and put my hand into
his side, I will not believe.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">26</span> After eight days, again his
disciples were inside and Thomas was with them. Jesus came, the doors
being locked, and stood in the middle, and said, “Peace be to you.”
<span class="bibleverse">27</span> Then he said to Thomas, “Reach here
your finger, and see my hands. Reach here your hand, and put it into my
side. Don’t be unbelieving, but believing.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">28</span> Thomas answered him, “My Lord and
my God!”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">29</span> Jesus said to him, “Because you
have seen me,<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>76</sup></a> you have believed. Blessed are
those who have not seen and have believed.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">30</span> Therefore Jesus did many other
signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this
book; <span class="bibleverse">31</span> but these are written that you
may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing
you may have life in his name.</p>
<h1 id="section-20">21</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> After these things, Jesus revealed
himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias. He revealed
himself this way. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> Simon Peter, Thomas
called Didymus,<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>77</sup></a> Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and
the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples were together.
<span class="bibleverse">3</span> Simon Peter said to them, “I’m going
fishing.”</p>
<p>They told him, “We are also coming with you.” They immediately went
out and entered into the boat. That night, they caught nothing. <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> But when day had already come, Jesus stood
on the beach; yet the disciples didn’t know that it was Jesus. <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> Jesus therefore said to them, “Children,
have you anything to eat?”</p>
<p>They answered him, “No.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">6</span> He said to them, “Cast the net on
the right side of the boat, and you will find some.”</p>
<p>They cast it therefore, and now they weren’t able to draw it in for
the multitude of fish. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> That disciple
therefore whom Jesus loved said to Peter, “It’s the Lord!”</p>
<p>So when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he wrapped his coat
around himself (for he was naked), and threw himself into the sea. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> But the other disciples came in the little
boat (for they were not far from the land, but about two hundred
cubits<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>78</sup></a> away), dragging the net full of
fish. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> So when they got out on the
land, they saw a fire of coals there, with fish and bread laid on it.
<span class="bibleverse">10</span> Jesus said to them, “Bring some of
the fish which you have just caught.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">11</span> Simon Peter went up, and drew the
net to land, full of one hundred fifty-three great fish. Even though
there were so many, the net wasn’t torn.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">12</span> Jesus said to them, “Come and eat
breakfast!”</p>
<p>None of the disciples dared inquire of him, “Who are you?” knowing
that it was the Lord.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">13</span> Then Jesus came and took the
bread, gave it to them, and the fish likewise. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> This is now the third time that Jesus was
revealed to his disciples after he had risen from the dead. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> So when they had eaten their breakfast,
Jesus said to Simon Peter, “Simon, son of Jonah, do you love me more
than these?”</p>
<p>He said to him, “Yes, Lord; you know that I have affection for
you.”</p>
<p>He said to him, “Feed my lambs.” <span class="bibleverse">16</span>
He said to him again a second time, “Simon, son of Jonah, do you love
me?”</p>
<p>He said to him, “Yes, Lord; you know that I have affection for
you.”</p>
<p>He said to him, “Tend my sheep.” <span class="bibleverse">17</span>
He said to him the third time, “Simon, son of Jonah, do you have
affection for me?”</p>
<p>Peter was grieved because he asked him the third time, “Do you have
affection for me?” He said to him, “Lord, you know everything. You know
that I have affection for you.”</p>
<p>Jesus said to him, “Feed my sheep. <span class="bibleverse">18</span>
Most certainly I tell you, when you were young, you dressed yourself and
walked where you wanted to. But when you are old, you will stretch out
your hands, and another will dress you and carry you where you don’t
want to go.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">19</span> Now he said this, signifying by
what kind of death he would glorify God. When he had said this, he said
to him, “Follow me.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">20</span> Then Peter, turning around, saw a
disciple following. This was the disciple whom Jesus loved, the one who
had also leaned on Jesus’ breast at the supper and asked, “Lord, who is
going to betray you?” <span class="bibleverse">21</span> Peter, seeing
him, said to Jesus, “Lord, what about this man?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">22</span> Jesus said to him, “If I desire
that he stay until I come, what is that to you? You follow me.” <span
class="bibleverse">23</span> This saying therefore went out among the
brothers<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>79</sup></a> that this disciple wouldn’t die.
Yet Jesus didn’t say to him that he wouldn’t die, but, “If I desire that
he stay until I come, what is that to you?”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">24</span> This is the disciple who testifies
about these things, and wrote these things. We know that his witness is
true. <span class="bibleverse">25</span> There are also many other
things which Jesus did, which if they would all be written, I suppose
that even the world itself wouldn’t have room for the books that would
be written.</p>
