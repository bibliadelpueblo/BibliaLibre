futility of all human effort as a result of the constant monotony in the
cycle of things</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> The words of the Preacher, the son
of David, king in Jerusalem: <span class="bibleverse">2</span> “Vanity
of vanities,” says the Preacher; “Vanity of vanities, all is vanity.”
<span class="bibleverse">3</span> What does man gain from all his labor
in which he labors under the sun? <span class="bibleverse">4</span> One
generation goes, and another generation comes; but the earth remains
forever. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> The sun also rises, and the
sun goes down, and hurries to its place where it rises. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> The wind goes toward the south, and turns
around to the north. It turns around continually as it goes, and the
wind returns again to its courses. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> All
the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is not full. To the place where
the rivers flow, there they flow again. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> All things are full of weariness beyond
uttering. The eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with
hearing. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> That which has been is that
which shall be, and that which has been done is that which shall be
done; and there is no new thing under the sun. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> Is there a thing of which it may be said,
“Behold,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> this is new?” It has been long ago,
in the ages which were before us. <span class="bibleverse">11</span>
There is no memory of the former; neither shall there be any memory of
the latter that are to come, among those that shall come after.</p>

futility of striving for wisdom and knowledge; Human life is useless to
the viewer</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">12</span> I, the Preacher, was king over
Israel in Jerusalem. <span class="bibleverse">13</span> I applied my
heart to seek and to search out by wisdom concerning all that is done
under the sky. It is a heavy burden that God<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> has
given to the sons of men to be afflicted with. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> I have seen all the works that are done
under the sun; and behold, all is vanity and a chasing after wind. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> That which is crooked can’t be made
straight; and that which is lacking can’t be counted.</p>
<h2 id="seeking-clear-knowledge-leads-to-disappointment">Seeking clear
knowledge leads to disappointment</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">16</span> I said to myself, “Behold, I have
obtained for myself great wisdom above all who were before me in
Jerusalem. Yes, my heart has had great experience of wisdom and
knowledge.” <span class="bibleverse">17</span> I applied my heart to
know wisdom, and to know madness and folly. I perceived that this also
was a chasing after wind. <span class="bibleverse">18</span> For in much
wisdom is much grief; and he who increases knowledge increases
sorrow.</p>

<h2
id="the-futility-of-trying-to-gain-satisfaction-through-sensual-pleasures-and-enjoyment-of-life-or-through-creative-activity">The
futility of trying to gain satisfaction through sensual pleasures and
enjoyment of life or through creative activity</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> I said in my heart, “Come now, I
will test you with mirth; therefore enjoy pleasure;” and behold, this
also was vanity. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> I said of laughter,
“It is foolishness;” and of mirth, “What does it accomplish?” <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> I searched in my heart how to cheer my flesh
with wine, my heart yet guiding me with wisdom, and how to lay hold of
folly, until I might see what it was good for the sons of men that they
should do under heaven all the days of their lives. <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> I made myself great works. I built myself
houses. I planted myself vineyards. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> I
made myself gardens and parks, and I planted trees in them of all kinds
of fruit. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> I made myself pools of
water, to water the forest where trees were grown. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> I bought male servants and female servants,
and had servants born in my house. I also had great possessions of herds
and flocks, above all who were before me in Jerusalem. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> I also gathered silver and gold for myself,
and the treasure of kings and of the provinces. I got myself male and
female singers, and the delights of the sons of men: musical instruments
of all sorts. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> So I was great, and
increased more than all who were before me in Jerusalem. My wisdom also
remained with me. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> Whatever my eyes
desired, I didn’t keep from them. I didn’t withhold my heart from any
joy, for my heart rejoiced because of all my labor, and this was my
portion from all my labor. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> Then I
looked at all the works that my hands had worked, and at the labor that
I had labored to do; and behold, all was vanity and a chasing after
wind, and there was no profit under the sun.</p>
<h2
id="in-the-end-wisdom-is-as-empty-as-madness-because-the-final-destiny-of-the-wise-and-the-foolish-is-the-same">In
the end, wisdom is as empty as madness, because the final destiny of the
wise and the foolish is the same</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">12</span> I turned myself to consider
wisdom, madness, and folly; for what can the king’s successor do? Just
that which has been done long ago. <span class="bibleverse">13</span>
Then I saw that wisdom excels folly, as far as light excels darkness.
<span class="bibleverse">14</span> The wise man’s eyes are in his head,
and the fool walks in darkness—and yet I perceived that one event
happens to them all. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> Then I said in
my heart, “As it happens to the fool, so will it happen even to me; and
why was I then more wise?” Then I said in my heart that this also is
vanity. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> For of the wise man, even as
of the fool, there is no memory forever, since in the days to come all
will have been long forgotten. Indeed, the wise man must die just like
the fool! <span class="bibleverse">17</span> So I hated life, because
the work that is worked under the sun was grievous to me; for all is
vanity and a chasing after wind.</p>
<h2
id="reference-to-the-evil-that-the-wise-man-must-leave-the-benefit-and-enjoyment-of-his-laborious-work-to-a-perhaps-foolish-heir">Reference
to the evil that the wise man must leave the benefit and enjoyment of
his laborious work to a perhaps foolish heir</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">18</span> I hated all my labor in which I
labored under the sun, because I must leave it to the man who comes
after me. <span class="bibleverse">19</span> Who knows whether he will
be a wise man or a fool? Yet he will have rule over all of my labor in
which I have labored, and in which I have shown myself wise under the
sun. This also is vanity. <span class="bibleverse">20</span> Therefore I
began to cause my heart to despair concerning all the labor in which I
had labored under the sun. <span class="bibleverse">21</span> For there
is a man whose labor is with wisdom, with knowledge, and with
skillfulness; yet he shall leave it for his portion to a man who has not
labored for it. This also is vanity and a great evil. <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> For what does a man have of all his labor
and of the striving of his heart, in which he labors under the sun?
<span class="bibleverse">23</span> For all his days are sorrows, and his
travail is grief; yes, even in the night his heart takes no rest. This
also is vanity.</p>
<h2
id="then-the-best-thing-for-man-is-to-enjoy-the-moment-to-the-extent-that-god-grants-it">Then
the best thing for man is to enjoy the moment to the extent that God
grants it</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">24</span> There is nothing better for a man
than that he should eat and drink, and make his soul enjoy good in his
labor. This also I saw, that it is from the hand of God. <span
class="bibleverse">25</span> For who can eat, or who can have enjoyment,
more than I? <span class="bibleverse">26</span> For to the man who
pleases him, God gives wisdom, knowledge, and joy; but to the sinner he
gives travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him who
pleases God. This also is vanity and a chasing after wind.</p>
<h1 id="section-2">3</h1>
<h2 id="everything-has-its-time">Everything has its time</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> For everything there is a season,
and a time for every purpose under heaven: <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> a time to be born, and a time to die; a time
to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted; <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> a time to kill, and a time to heal; a time
to break down, and a time to build up; <span class="bibleverse">4</span>
a time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to
dance; <span class="bibleverse">5</span> a time to cast away stones, and
a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to
refrain from embracing; <span class="bibleverse">6</span> a time to
seek, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away; <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> a time to tear, and a time to sew; a time to
keep silence, and a time to speak; <span class="bibleverse">8</span> a
time to love, and a time to hate; a time for war, and a time for
peace.</p>
<h2
id="but-man-does-not-know-the-time-set-by-god-and-is-powerless-against-it">But
man does not know the time set by God and is powerless against it</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">9</span> What profit has he who works in
that in which he labors? <span class="bibleverse">10</span> I have seen
the burden which God has given to the sons of men to be afflicted with.
<span class="bibleverse">11</span> He has made everything beautiful in
its time. He has also set eternity in their hearts, yet so that man
can’t find out the work that God has done from the beginning even to the
end. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> I know that there is nothing
better for them than to rejoice, and to do good as long as they live.
<span class="bibleverse">13</span> Also that every man should eat and
drink, and enjoy good in all his labor, is the gift of God. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> I know that whatever God does, it shall be
forever. Nothing can be added to it, nor anything taken from it; and God
has done it, that men should fear before him. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> That which is has been long ago, and that
which is to be has been long ago. God seeks again that which is passed
away.</p>
<h2
id="in-the-human-world-there-is-evil-and-injustice-but-god-is-the-world-judge">In
the human world there is evil and injustice, but God is the world
judge</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">16</span> Moreover I saw under the sun, in
the place of justice, that wickedness was there; and in the place of
righteousness, that wickedness was there. <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> I said in my heart, “God will judge the
righteous and the wicked; for there is a time there for every purpose
and for every work.”</p>
<h2
id="the-law-of-impermanence-exists-for-both-humans-and-animals-and-exhorts-to-enjoy-life">The
law of impermanence exists for both humans and animals and exhorts to
enjoy life</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">18</span> I said in my heart, “As for the
sons of men, God tests them, so that they may see that they themselves
are like animals. <span class="bibleverse">19</span> For that which
happens to the sons of men happens to animals. Even one thing happens to
them. As the one dies, so the other dies. Yes, they have all one breath;
and man has no advantage over the animals, for all is vanity. <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> All go to one place. All are from the dust,
and all turn to dust again. <span class="bibleverse">21</span> Who knows
the spirit of man, whether it goes upward, and the spirit of the animal,
whether it goes downward to the earth?” <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> Therefore I saw that there is nothing
better than that a man should rejoice in his works, for that is his
portion; for who can bring him to see what will be after him?</p>
<h1 id="section-3">4</h1>
<h2
id="oppression-jealousy-and-partly-restless-work-partly-slow-calm-devalue-life">Oppression,
jealousy and partly restless work, partly slow calm devalue life</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Then I returned and saw all the
oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold, the tears of those
who were oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their
oppressors there was power; but they had no comforter. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> Therefore I praised the dead who have been
long dead more than the living who are yet alive. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> Yes, better than them both is him who has
not yet been, who has not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.
<span class="bibleverse">4</span> Then I saw all the labor and
achievement that is the envy of a man’s neighbor. This also is vanity
and a striving after wind. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> The fool
folds his hands together and ruins himself. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> Better is a handful, with quietness, than
two handfuls with labor and chasing after wind.</p>
<h2
id="the-effort-of-the-single-person-is-useless-two-workers-who-work-together-are-better-off">The
effort of the single person is useless; two workers who work together
are better off</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">7</span> Then I returned and saw vanity
under the sun. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> There is one who is
alone, and he has neither son nor brother. There is no end to all of his
labor, neither are his eyes satisfied with wealth. “For whom then do I
labor and deprive my soul of enjoyment?” This also is vanity. Yes, it is
a miserable business. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> Two are better
than one, because they have a good reward for their labor. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> For if they fall, the one will lift up his
fellow; but woe to him who is alone when he falls, and doesn’t have
another to lift him up. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> Again, if two
lie together, then they have warmth; but how can one keep warm alone?
<span class="bibleverse">12</span> If a man prevails against one who is
alone, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly
broken.</p>
<h2
id="communication-of-a-historical-event-confirming-the-preachers-observation-that-popular-favor-is-unreliable">Communication
of a historical event confirming the preacher's observation that popular
favor is unreliable</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">13</span> Better is a poor and wise youth
than an old and foolish king who doesn’t know how to receive admonition
any more. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> For out of prison he came
out to be king; yes, even in his kingdom he was born poor. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> I saw all the living who walk under the
sun, that they were with the youth, the other, who succeeded him. <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> There was no end of all the people, even of
all them over whom he was—yet those who come after shall not rejoice in
him. Surely this also is vanity and a chasing after wind.</p>

to be careful when performing religious duties (with sacrifices, prayer
and vows)</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Guard your steps when you go to
God’s house; for to draw near to listen is better than to give the
sacrifice of fools, for they don’t know that they do evil. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> Don’t be rash with your mouth, and don’t let
your heart be hasty to utter anything before God; for God is in heaven,
and you on earth. Therefore let your words be few. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> For as a dream comes with a multitude of
cares, so a fool’s speech with a multitude of words. <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> When you vow a vow to God, don’t defer to
pay it; for he has no pleasure in fools. Pay that which you vow. <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> It is better that you should not vow, than
that you should vow and not pay. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> Don’t
allow your mouth to lead you into sin. Don’t protest before the
messenger that this was a mistake. Why should God be angry at your
voice, and destroy the work of your hands? <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> For in the multitude of dreams there are
vanities, as well as in many words; but you must fear God.</p>
<h2

oppressions in the state are unfortunate, but understandable; Royalty
Blessings for Farm States</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">8</span> If you see the oppression of the
poor, and the violent taking away of justice and righteousness in a
district, don’t marvel at the matter, for one official is eyed by a
higher one, and there are officials over them. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> Moreover the profit of the earth is for all.
The king profits from the field.</p>
<h2 id="nullity-and-complaints-of-riches">Nullity and complaints of
riches</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">10</span> He who loves silver shall not be
satisfied with silver, nor he who loves abundance, with increase. This
also is vanity. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> When goods increase,
those who eat them are increased; and what advantage is there to its
owner, except to feast on them with his eyes? <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> The sleep of a laboring man is sweet,
whether he eats little or much; but the abundance of the rich will not
allow him to sleep. <span class="bibleverse">13</span> There is a
grievous evil which I have seen under the sun: wealth kept by its owner
to his harm. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> Those riches perish by
misfortune, and if he has fathered a son, there is nothing in his hand.
<span class="bibleverse">15</span> As he came out of his mother’s womb,
naked shall he go again as he came, and shall take nothing for his
labor, which he may carry away in his hand. <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> This also is a grievous evil, that in all
points as he came, so shall he go. And what profit does he have who
labors for the wind? <span class="bibleverse">17</span> All his days he
also eats in darkness, he is frustrated, and has sickness and wrath.</p>
<h2

of the enjoyment of life in addition to work and wealth</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">18</span> Behold, that which I have seen to
be good and proper is for one to eat and to drink, and to enjoy good in
all his labor, in which he labors under the sun, all the days of his
life which God has given him; for this is his portion. <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> Every man also to whom God has given riches
and wealth, and has given him power to eat of it, and to take his
portion, and to rejoice in his labor—this is the gift of God. <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> For he shall not often reflect on the days
of his life, because God occupies him with the joy of his heart.</p>

<h2 id="someone-has-rich-goods-but-does-not-enjoy-them">Someone has rich
goods but does not enjoy them</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> There is an evil which I have seen
under the sun, and it is heavy on men: <span class="bibleverse">2</span>
a man to whom God gives riches, wealth, and honor, so that he lacks
nothing for his soul of all that he desires, yet God gives him no power
to eat of it, but an alien eats it. This is vanity, and it is an evil
disease. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> If a man fathers a hundred
children, and lives many years, so that the days of his years are many,
but his soul is not filled with good, and moreover he has no burial, I
say that a stillborn child is better than he; <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> for it comes in vanity, and departs in
darkness, and its name is covered with darkness. <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> Moreover it has not seen the sun nor known
it. This has rest rather than the other. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> Yes, though he live a thousand years twice

<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> A good name is better than fine
perfume; and the day of death better than the day of one’s birth. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> It is better to go to the house of mourning
than to go to the house of feasting; for that is the end of all men, and
the living should take this to heart. <span class="bibleverse">3</span>
Sorrow is better than laughter; for by the sadness of the face the heart
is made good. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> The heart of the wise is
in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of
mirth. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> It is better to hear the rebuke
of the wise than for a man to hear the song of fools. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> For as the crackling of thorns under a pot,
so is the laughter of the fool. This also is vanity. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> Surely extortion makes the wise man foolish;
and a bribe destroys the understanding. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> Better is the end of a thing than its
beginning. The patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.
<span class="bibleverse">9</span> Don’t be hasty in your spirit to be
angry, for anger rests in the bosom of fools. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> Don’t say, “Why were the former days better
than these?” For you do not ask wisely about this. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> Wisdom is as good as an inheritance. Yes,
it is more excellent for those who see the sun. <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> For wisdom is a defense, even as money is a
defense; but the excellency of knowledge is that wisdom preserves the
life of him who has it. <span class="bibleverse">13</span> Consider the
work of God, for who can make that straight which he has made crooked?
<span class="bibleverse">14</span> In the day of prosperity be joyful,

<p><span class="bibleverse">15</span> All this I have seen in my days of
vanity: there is a righteous man who perishes in his righteousness, and
there is a wicked man who lives long in his evildoing. <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> Don’t be overly righteous, neither make
yourself overly wise. Why should you destroy yourself? <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> Don’t be too wicked, neither be foolish.
Why should you die before your time? <span class="bibleverse">18</span>
It is good that you should take hold of this. Yes, also don’t withdraw
your hand from that; for he who fears God will come out of them all.
<span class="bibleverse">19</span> Wisdom is a strength to the wise man
more than ten rulers who are in a city. <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> Surely there is not a righteous man on
earth who does good and doesn’t sin. <span class="bibleverse">21</span>
Also don’t take heed to all words that are spoken, lest you hear your
servant curse you; <span class="bibleverse">22</span> for often your own
heart knows that you yourself have likewise cursed others. <span
class="bibleverse">23</span> All this I have proved in wisdom. I said,
“I will be wise;” but it was far from me. <span

is madness. <span class="bibleverse">26</span> I find more bitter than
death the woman whose heart is snares and traps, whose hands are chains.
Whoever pleases God shall escape from her; but the sinner will be
ensnared by her. <span class="bibleverse">27</span> “Behold, I have
found this,” says the Preacher, “to one another, to find an explanation
<span class="bibleverse">28</span> which my soul still seeks, but I have
not found. I have found one man among a thousand, but I have not found a

<h2 id="impotence-and-disorientation-of-man">Impotence and
disorientation of man</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">6</span> For there is a time and procedure
for every purpose, although the misery of man is heavy on him. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> For he doesn’t know that which will be; for
who can tell him how it will be? <span class="bibleverse">8</span> There
is no man who has power over the spirit to contain the spirit; neither
does he have power over the day of death. There is no discharge in war;
neither shall wickedness deliver those who practice it.</p>
<h2

and wicked usually meet the same fate in a single violence; It belongs
when one has guidelines for the enjoyment of life at work</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">9</span> All this I have seen, and applied
my mind to every work that is done under the sun. There is a time in
which one man has power over another to his hurt. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> So I saw the wicked buried. Indeed they
came also from holiness. They went and were forgotten in the city where
they did this. This also is vanity. <span class="bibleverse">11</span>
Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily,
therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.
<span class="bibleverse">12</span> Though a sinner commits crimes a
hundred times, and lives long, yet surely I know that it will be better
with those who fear God, who are reverent before him. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> But it shall not be well with the wicked,
neither shall he lengthen days like a shadow, because he doesn’t fear
God. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> There is a vanity which is done
on the earth, that there are righteous men to whom it happens according
to the work of the wicked. Again, there are wicked men to whom it
happens according to the work of the righteous. I said that this also is
vanity. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> Then I commended mirth,
because a man has no better thing under the sun than to eat, to drink,
and to be joyful: for that will accompany him in his labor all the days
of his life which God has given him under the sun.</p>
<h2
id="the-government-of-god-in-the-world-government-is-unfathomable-to-man">The
government of God in the world government is unfathomable to man</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">16</span> When I applied my heart to know
wisdom, and to see the business that is done on the earth (even though
eyes see no sleep day or night), <span class="bibleverse">17</span> then
I saw all the work of God, that man can’t find out the work that is done
under the sun, because however much a man labors to seek it out, yet he
won’t find it. Yes even though a wise man thinks he can comprehend it,
he won’t be able to find it.</p>

same fate for all in life and in death; human impotence against deity;
Pious enjoyment of life before death sets a goal for all enjoyment and
activity</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> For all this I laid to my heart,
even to explore all this: that the righteous, and the wise, and their
works, are in the hand of God; whether it is love or hatred, man doesn’t
know it; all is before them. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> All
things come alike to all. There is one event to the righteous and to the
wicked; to the good, to the clean, to the unclean, to him who
sacrifices, and to him who doesn’t sacrifice. As is the good, so is the
sinner; he who takes an oath, as he who fears an oath. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> This is an evil in all that is done under
the sun, that there is one event to all. Yes also, the heart of the sons
of men is full of evil, and madness is in their heart while they live,
and after that they go to the dead. <span class="bibleverse">4</span>
For to him who is joined with all the living there is hope; for a living
dog is better than a dead lion. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> For
the living know that they will die, but the dead don’t know anything,
neither do they have any more a reward; for their memory is forgotten.
<span class="bibleverse">6</span> Also their love, their hatred, and
their envy has perished long ago; neither do they any longer have a
portion forever in anything that is done under the sun. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> Go your way—eat your bread with joy, and
drink your wine with a merry heart; for God has already accepted your
works. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> Let your garments be always
white, and don’t let your head lack oil. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> Live joyfully with the wife whom you love
all the days of your life of vanity, which he has given you under the
sun, all your days of vanity, for that is your portion in life, and in
your labor in which you labor under the sun. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with
your might; for there is no work, nor plan, nor knowledge, nor wisdom,
in Sheol,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> where you are going.</p>
<h2 id="mans-dependence-on-destiny">Man's Dependence on Destiny</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">11</span> I returned and saw under the sun
that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither
yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet
favor to men of skill; but time and chance happen to them all. <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> For man also doesn’t know his time. As the
fish that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in
the snare, even so are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it
falls suddenly on them.</p>
<h2 id="more-life-experiences-and-wisdom-sayings">More life experiences
and wisdom sayings</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">13</span> I have also seen wisdom under the
sun in this way, and it seemed great to me. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> There was a little city, and few men within
it; and a great king came against it, besieged it, and built great
bulwarks against it. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> Now a poor wise
man was found in it, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man
remembered that same poor man. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> Then I
said, “Wisdom is better than strength.” Nevertheless the poor man’s
wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard. <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> The words of the wise heard in quiet are
better than the cry of him who rules among fools. <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> Wisdom is better than weapons of war; but
one sinner destroys much good.</p>
<h1 id="section-9">10</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Dead flies cause the oil of the
perfumer to produce an evil odor; so does a little folly outweigh wisdom
and honor. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> A wise man’s heart is at
his right hand, but a fool’s heart at his left. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> Yes also when the fool walks by the way, his
understanding fails him, and he says to everyone that he is a fool.
<span class="bibleverse">4</span> If the spirit of the ruler rises up
against you, don’t leave your place; for gentleness lays great offenses
to rest. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> There is an evil which I have
seen under the sun, the sort of error which proceeds from the ruler.
<span class="bibleverse">6</span> Folly is set in great dignity, and the
rich sit in a low place. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> I have seen
servants on horses, and princes walking like servants on the earth.
<span class="bibleverse">8</span> He who digs a pit may fall into it;
and whoever breaks through a wall may be bitten by a snake. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> Whoever carves out stones may be injured by
them. Whoever splits wood may be endangered by it. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> If the ax is blunt, and one doesn’t sharpen
the edge, then he must use more strength; but skill brings success.
<span class="bibleverse">11</span> If the snake bites before it is
charmed, then is there no profit for the charmer’s tongue. <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> The words of a wise man’s mouth are
gracious; but a fool is swallowed by his own lips. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> The beginning of the words of his mouth is
foolishness; and the end of his talk is mischievous madness. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> A fool also multiplies words. Man doesn’t
know what will be; and that which will be after him, who can tell him?
<span class="bibleverse">15</span> The labor of fools wearies every one
of them; for he doesn’t know how to go to the city. <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> Woe to you, land, when your king is a
child, and your princes eat in the morning! <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> Happy are you, land, when your king is the
son of nobles, and your princes eat in due season, for strength, and not
for drunkenness! <span class="bibleverse">18</span> By slothfulness the
roof sinks in; and through idleness of the hands the house leaks. <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> A feast is made for laughter, and wine
makes the life glad; and money is the answer for all things. <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> Don’t curse the king, no, not in your
thoughts; and don’t curse the rich in your bedroom, for a bird of the
sky may carry your voice, and that which has wings may tell the
matter.</p>

Give a portion to seven, yes, even to eight; for you don’t know what
evil will be on the earth. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> If the
clouds are full of rain, they empty themselves on the earth; and if a
tree falls toward the south, or toward the north, in the place where the
tree falls, there shall it be. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> He who
observes the wind won’t sow; and he who regards the clouds won’t reap.
<span class="bibleverse">5</span> As you don’t know what is the way of
the wind, nor how the bones grow in the womb of her who is with child;
even so you don’t know the work of God who does all. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> In the morning sow your seed, and in the
evening don’t withhold your hand; for you don’t know which will prosper,
whether this or that, or whether they both will be equally good. <span

pleasant thing for the eyes to see the sun. <span

house shall tremble, and the strong men shall bow themselves, and the
grinders cease because they are few, and those who look out of the
windows are darkened, <span class="bibleverse">4</span> and the doors
shall be shut in the street; when the sound of the grinding is low, and
one shall rise up at the voice of a bird, and all the daughters of music
shall be brought low; <span class="bibleverse">5</span> yes, they shall
be afraid of heights, and terrors will be on the way; and the almond
tree shall blossom, and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire
shall fail; because man goes to his everlasting home, and the mourners
go about the streets; <span class="bibleverse">6</span> before the
silver cord is severed, or the golden bowl is broken, or the pitcher is
broken at the spring, or the wheel broken at the cistern, <span

“All is vanity!” <span class="bibleverse">9</span> Further, because the
Preacher was wise, he still taught the people knowledge. Yes, he
pondered, sought out, and set in order many proverbs. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> The Preacher sought to find out acceptable
words, and that which was written blamelessly, words of truth. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> The words of the wise are like goads; and
like nails well fastened are words from the masters of assemblies, which
are given from one shepherd.</p>

weariness of the flesh. <span class="bibleverse">13</span> This is the
end of the matter. All has been heard. Fear God and keep his
commandments; for this is the whole duty of man. <span

judgment, with every hidden thing, whether it is good, or whether it is
evil.</p>
