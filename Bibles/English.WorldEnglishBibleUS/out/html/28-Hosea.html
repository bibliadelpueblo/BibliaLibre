<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Yahweh’s<a href="#fn1"

word that came to Hosea the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham,
Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son
of Joash, king of Israel.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">2</span> When Yahweh spoke at first by
Hosea, Yahweh said to Hosea, “Go, take for yourself a wife of
prostitution and children of unfaithfulness; for the land commits great
adultery, forsaking Yahweh.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">3</span> So he went and took Gomer the
daughter of Diblaim; and she conceived, and bore him a son.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">4</span> Yahweh said to him, “Call his name
Jezreel, for yet a little while, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel
on the house of Jehu, and will cause the kingdom of the house of Israel
to cease. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> It will happen in that day
that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">6</span> She conceived again, and bore a
daughter.</p>
<p>Then he said to him, “Call her name Lo-Ruhamah,<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> for
I will no longer have mercy on the house of Israel, that I should in any
way pardon them. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> But I will have mercy
on the house of Judah, and will save them by Yahweh their God,<a
href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> and will not save them by bow,
sword, battle, horses, or horsemen.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">8</span> Now when she had weaned Lo-Ruhamah,
she conceived, and bore a son.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">9</span> He said, “Call his name Lo-Ammi,<a
href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> for you are not my people, and I
will not be yours. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> Yet the number of
the children of Israel will be as the sand of the sea, which can’t be
measured or counted; and it will come to pass that, in the place where
it was said to them, ‘You are not my people,’ they will be called ‘sons
of the living God.’ <span class="bibleverse">11</span> The children of
Judah and the children of Israel will be gathered together, and they
will appoint themselves one head, and will go up from the land; for
great will be the day of Jezreel.</p>
<h1 id="section-1">2</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> “Say to your brothers, ‘My
people!’<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> and to your sisters, ‘My loved
one!’<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> <span class="bibleverse">2</span>
Contend with your mother! Contend, for she is not my wife, neither am I
her husband; and let her put away her prostitution from her face, and
her adulteries from between her breasts; <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> lest I strip her naked, and make her bare as
in the day that she was born, and make her like a wilderness, and set
her like a dry land, and kill her with thirst. <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> Indeed, on her children I will have no
mercy, for they are children of unfaithfulness. <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> For their mother has played the prostitute.
She who conceived them has done shamefully; for she said, ‘I will go
after my lovers, who give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax,
my oil and my drink.’ <span class="bibleverse">6</span> Therefore
behold,<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> I will hedge up your way with
thorns, and I will build a wall against her, that she can’t find her
way. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> She will follow after her lovers,
but she won’t overtake them; and she will seek them, but won’t find
them. Then she will say, ‘I will go and return to my first husband, for
then it was better with me than now.’ <span class="bibleverse">8</span>
For she didn’t know that I gave her the grain, the new wine, and the
oil, and multiplied to her silver and gold, which they used for Baal.
<span class="bibleverse">9</span> Therefore I will take back my grain in
its time, and my new wine in its season, and will pluck away my wool and
my flax which should have covered her nakedness. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> Now I will uncover her lewdness in the
sight of her lovers, and no one will deliver her out of my hand. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> I will also cause all her celebrations to
cease: her feasts, her new moons, her Sabbaths, and all her solemn
assemblies. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> I will lay waste her
vines and her fig trees, about which she has said, ‘These are my wages
that my lovers have given me,’ and I will make them a forest, and the
animals of the field shall eat them. <span class="bibleverse">13</span>
I will visit on her the days of the Baals, to which she burned incense
when she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels, and went after
her lovers and forgot me,” says Yahweh. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> “Therefore behold, I will allure her, and
bring her into the wilderness, and speak tenderly to her. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> I will give her vineyards from there, and
the valley of Achor for a door of hope; and she will respond there as in
the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the
land of Egypt. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> It will be in that
day,” says Yahweh, “that you will call me ‘my husband,’ and no longer
call me ‘my master.’ <span class="bibleverse">17</span> For I will take
away the names of the Baals out of her mouth, and they will no longer be
mentioned by name. <span class="bibleverse">18</span> In that day I will
make a covenant for them with the animals of the field, and with the
birds of the sky, and with the creeping things of the ground. I will
break the bow, the sword, and the battle out of the land, and will make
them lie down safely. <span class="bibleverse">19</span> I will betroth
you to me forever. Yes, I will betroth you to me in righteousness, in
justice, in loving kindness, and in compassion. <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> I will even betroth you to me in
faithfulness; and you shall know Yahweh. <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> It will happen in that day, that I will
respond,” says Yahweh. “I will respond to the heavens, and they will
respond to the earth; <span class="bibleverse">22</span> and the earth
will respond to the grain, and the new wine, and the oil; and they will
respond to Jezreel. <span class="bibleverse">23</span> I will sow her to
me in the earth; and I will have mercy on her who had not obtained
mercy; and I will tell those who were not my people, ‘You are my
people;’ and they will say, ‘You are My God!’”</p>
<h1 id="section-2">3</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Yahweh said to me, “Go again, love
a woman loved by another, and an adulteress, even as Yahweh loves the
children of Israel, though they turn to other gods, and love cakes of
raisins.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">2</span> So I bought her for myself for
fifteen pieces of silver and a homer<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> and a half of barley.
<span class="bibleverse">3</span> I said to her, “You shall stay with me
many days. You shall not play the prostitute, and you shall not be with
any other man. I will also be so toward you.”</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">4</span> For the children of Israel shall
live many days without king, without prince, without sacrifice, without
sacred stone, and without ephod or idols. <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> Afterward the children of Israel shall
return and seek Yahweh their God, and David their king, and shall come
with trembling to Yahweh and to his blessings in the last days.</p>
<h1 id="section-3">4</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Hear Yahweh’s word, you children of
Israel, for Yahweh has a charge against the inhabitants of the land:
“Indeed there is no truth, nor goodness, nor knowledge of God in the
land. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> There is cursing, lying, murder,
stealing, and committing adultery; they break boundaries, and bloodshed
causes bloodshed. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> Therefore the land
will mourn, and everyone who dwells in it will waste away, with all
living things in her, even the animals of the field and the birds of the
sky; yes, the fish of the sea also die. <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> “Yet let no man bring a charge, neither let
any man accuse; for your people are like those who bring charges against
a priest. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> You will stumble in the day,
and the prophet will also stumble with you in the night; and I will
destroy your mother. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> My people are
destroyed for lack of knowledge. Because you have rejected knowledge, I
will also reject you, that you may be no priest to me. Because you have
forgotten your God’s law, I will also forget your children. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> As they were multiplied, so they sinned
against me. I will change their glory into shame. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> They feed on the sin of my people, and set
their heart on their iniquity. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> It will
be like people, like priest; and I will punish them for their ways, and
will repay them for their deeds. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> They
will eat, and not have enough. They will play the prostitute, and will
not increase; because they have abandoned listening to Yahweh. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> Prostitution, wine, and new wine take away
understanding. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> My people consult with
their wooden idol, and answer to a stick of wood. Indeed the spirit of
prostitution has led them astray, and they have been unfaithful to their
God. <span class="bibleverse">13</span> They sacrifice on the tops of
the mountains, and burn incense on the hills, under oaks, poplars, and
terebinths, because its shade is good. Therefore your daughters play the
prostitute, and your brides commit adultery. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> I will not punish your daughters when they
play the prostitute, nor your brides when they commit adultery; because
the men consort with prostitutes, and they sacrifice with the shrine
prostitutes; so the people without understanding will come to ruin.
<span class="bibleverse">15</span> “Though you, Israel, play the
prostitute, yet don’t let Judah offend; and don’t come to Gilgal,
neither go up to Beth Aven, nor swear, ‘As Yahweh lives.’ <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> For Israel has behaved extremely
stubbornly, like a stubborn heifer. Then how will Yahweh feed them like
a lamb in a meadow? <span class="bibleverse">17</span> Ephraim is joined
to idols. Leave him alone! <span class="bibleverse">18</span> Their
drink has become sour. They play the prostitute continually. Her rulers
dearly love their shameful way. <span class="bibleverse">19</span> The
wind has wrapped her up in its wings; and they shall be disappointed
because of their sacrifices.</p>
<h1 id="section-4">5</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> “Listen to this, you priests!
Listen, house of Israel, and give ear, house of the king! For the
judgment is against you; for you have been a snare at Mizpah, and a net
spread on Tabor. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> The rebels are deep
in slaughter, but I discipline all of them. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hidden
from me; for now, Ephraim, you have played the prostitute. Israel is
defiled. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> Their deeds won’t allow them
to turn to their God, for the spirit of prostitution is within them, and
they don’t know Yahweh. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> The pride of
Israel testifies to his face. Therefore Israel and Ephraim will stumble
in their iniquity. Judah also will stumble with them. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> They will go with their flocks and with
their herds to seek Yahweh, but they won’t find him. He has withdrawn
himself from them. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> They are unfaithful
to Yahweh; for they have borne illegitimate children. Now the new moon
will devour them with their fields. <span class="bibleverse">8</span>
“Blow the cornet in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah! Sound a battle cry
at Beth Aven, behind you, Benjamin! <span class="bibleverse">9</span>
Ephraim will become a desolation in the day of rebuke. Among the tribes
of Israel, I have made known that which will surely be. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> The princes of Judah are like those who
remove a landmark. I will pour out my wrath on them like water. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> Ephraim is oppressed, he is crushed in
judgment, because he is intent in his pursuit of idols. <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> Therefore I am to Ephraim like a moth, and
to the house of Judah like rottenness. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> “When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah
his wound, then Ephraim went to Assyria, and sent to King Jareb: but he
is not able to heal you, neither will he cure you of your wound. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> For I will be to Ephraim like a lion, and
like a young lion to the house of Judah. I myself will tear in pieces
and go away. I will carry off, and there will be no one to deliver.
<span class="bibleverse">15</span> I will go and return to my place,
until they acknowledge their offense, and seek my face. In their
affliction they will seek me earnestly.”</p>
<h1 id="section-5">6</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> “Come! Let’s return to Yahweh; for
he has torn us to pieces, and he will heal us; he has injured us, and he
will bind up our wounds. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> After two
days he will revive us. On the third day he will raise us up, and we
will live before him. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> Let’s
acknowledge Yahweh. Let’s press on to know Yahweh. As surely as the sun
rises, Yahweh will appear. He will come to us like the rain, like the
spring rain that waters the earth.” <span class="bibleverse">4</span>
“Ephraim, what shall I do to you? Judah, what shall I do to you? For
your love is like a morning cloud, and like the dew that disappears
early. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> Therefore I have cut them to
pieces with the prophets; I killed them with the words of my mouth. Your
judgments are like a flash of lightning. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> For I desire mercy, and not sacrifice; and
the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> But they, like Adam, have broken the
covenant. They were unfaithful to me there. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> Gilead is a city of those who work iniquity;
it is stained with blood. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> As gangs of
robbers wait to ambush a man, so the company of priests murder on the
path toward Shechem, committing shameful crimes. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> In the house of Israel I have seen a
horrible thing. There is prostitution in Ephraim. Israel is defiled.
<span class="bibleverse">11</span> “Also, Judah, there is a harvest
appointed for you, when I restore the fortunes of my people.</p>
<h1 id="section-6">7</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> When I would heal Israel, then the
iniquity of Ephraim is uncovered, also the wickedness of Samaria; for
they commit falsehood, and the thief enters in, and the gang of robbers
ravages outside. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> They don’t consider
in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness. Now their own
deeds have engulfed them. They are before my face. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> They make the king glad with their
wickedness, and the princes with their lies. <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> They are all adulterers. They are burning
like an oven that the baker stops stirring, from the kneading of the
dough, until it is leavened. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> On the
day of our king, the princes made themselves sick with the heat of wine.
He joined his hand with mockers. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> For
they have prepared their heart like an oven, while they lie in wait.
Their anger smolders all night. In the morning it burns as a flaming
fire. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> They are all hot as an oven, and
devour their judges. All their kings have fallen. There is no one among
them who calls to me. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> Ephraim mixes
himself among the nations. Ephraim is a pancake not turned over. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> Strangers have devoured his strength, and he
doesn’t realize it. Indeed, gray hairs are here and there on him, and he
doesn’t realize it. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> The pride of
Israel testifies to his face; yet they haven’t returned to Yahweh their
God, nor sought him, for all this. <span class="bibleverse">11</span>
“Ephraim is like an easily deceived dove, without understanding. They
call to Egypt. They go to Assyria. <span class="bibleverse">12</span>
When they go, I will spread my net on them. I will bring them down like
the birds of the sky. I will chastise them, as their congregation has
heard. <span class="bibleverse">13</span> Woe to them! For they have
wandered from me. Destruction to them! For they have trespassed against
me. Though I would redeem them, yet they have spoken lies against me.
<span class="bibleverse">14</span> They haven’t cried to me with their
heart, but they howl on their beds. They assemble themselves for grain
and new wine. They turn away from me. <span class="bibleverse">15</span>
Though I have taught and strengthened their arms, yet they plot evil
against me. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> They return, but not to
the Most High. They are like a faulty bow. Their princes will fall by
the sword for the rage of their tongue. This will be their derision in
the land of Egypt.</p>
<h1 id="section-7">8</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> “Put the trumpet to your lips!
Something like an eagle is over Yahweh’s house, because they have broken
my covenant and rebelled against my law. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> They cry to me, ‘My God, we, Israel,
acknowledge you!’ <span class="bibleverse">3</span> Israel has cast off
that which is good. The enemy will pursue him. <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> They have set up kings, but not by me. They
have made princes, and I didn’t approve. Of their silver and their gold
they have made themselves idols, that they may be cut off. <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> Let Samaria throw out his calf idol! My
anger burns against them! How long will it be until they are capable of
purity? <span class="bibleverse">6</span> For this is even from Israel!
The workman made it, and it is no God; indeed, the calf of Samaria shall
be broken in pieces. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> For they sow the
wind, and they will reap the whirlwind. He has no standing grain. The
stalk will yield no head. If it does yield, strangers will swallow it
up. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> Israel is swallowed up. Now they
are among the nations like a worthless thing. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> For they have gone up to Assyria, like a
wild donkey wandering alone. Ephraim has hired lovers for himself. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> But although they sold themselves among the
nations, I will now gather them; and they begin to waste away because of
the oppression of the king of mighty ones. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> Because Ephraim has multiplied altars for
sinning, they became for him altars for sinning. <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> I wrote for him the many things of my law,
but they were regarded as a strange thing. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> As for the sacrifices of my offerings, they
sacrifice meat and eat it, but Yahweh doesn’t accept them. Now he will
remember their iniquity, and punish their sins. They will return to
Egypt. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> For Israel has forgotten his
Maker and built palaces; and Judah has multiplied fortified cities; but
I will send a fire on his cities, and it will devour its
fortresses.”</p>
<h1 id="section-8">9</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Don’t rejoice, Israel, to
jubilation like the nations; for you were unfaithful to your God. You
love the wages of a prostitute at every grain threshing floor. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> The threshing floor and the wine press won’t
feed them, and the new wine will fail her. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> They won’t dwell in Yahweh’s land; but
Ephraim will return to Egypt, and they will eat unclean food in Assyria.
<span class="bibleverse">4</span> They won’t pour out wine offerings to
Yahweh, neither will they be pleasing to him. Their sacrifices will be
to them like the bread of mourners; all who eat of it will be polluted;
for their bread will be for their appetite. It will not come into
Yahweh’s house. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> What will you do in
the day of solemn assembly, and in the day of the feast of Yahweh? <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> For, behold, when they flee destruction,
Egypt will gather them up. Memphis will bury them. Nettles will possess
their pleasant things of silver. Thorns will be in their tents. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> The days of visitation have come. The days
of reckoning have come. Israel will consider the prophet to be a fool,
and the man who is inspired to be insane, because of the abundance of
your sins, and because your hostility is great. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> A prophet watches over Ephraim with my God.
A fowler’s snare is on all of his paths, and hostility in the house of
his God. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> They have deeply corrupted
themselves, as in the days of Gibeah. He will remember their iniquity.
He will punish them for their sins. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> I
found Israel like grapes in the wilderness. I saw your fathers as the
first ripe in the fig tree at its first season; but they came to Baal
Peor, and consecrated themselves to the shameful thing, and became
abominable like that which they loved. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> As for Ephraim, their glory will fly away
like a bird. There will be no birth, no one with child, and no
conception. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> Though they bring up
their children, yet I will bereave them, so that not a man shall be
left. Indeed, woe also to them when I depart from them! <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> I have seen Ephraim, like Tyre, planted in
a pleasant place; but Ephraim will bring out his children to the
murderer. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> Give them—Yahweh what will
you give? Give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> “All their wickedness is in Gilgal; for
there I hated them. Because of the wickedness of their deeds, I will
drive them out of my house! I will love them no more. All their princes
are rebels. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> Ephraim is struck. Their
root has dried up. They will bear no fruit. Even though they give birth,
yet I will kill the beloved ones of their womb.” <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> My God will cast them away, because they
didn’t listen to him; and they will be wanderers among the nations.</p>
<h1 id="section-9">10</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Israel is a luxuriant vine that
produces his fruit. According to the abundance of his fruit he has
multiplied his altars. As their land has prospered, they have adorned
their sacred stones. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> Their heart is
divided. Now they will be found guilty. He will demolish their altars.
He will destroy their sacred stones. <span class="bibleverse">3</span>
Surely now they will say, “We have no king; for we don’t fear Yahweh;
and the king, what can he do for us?” <span class="bibleverse">4</span>
They make promises, swearing falsely in making covenants. Therefore
judgment springs up like poisonous weeds in the furrows of the field.
<span class="bibleverse">5</span> The inhabitants of Samaria will be in
terror for the calves of Beth Aven, for its people will mourn over it,
along with its priests who rejoiced over it, for its glory, because it
has departed from it. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> It also will be
carried to Assyria for a present to a great king. Ephraim will receive
shame, and Israel will be ashamed of his own counsel. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> Samaria and her king float away like a twig
on the water. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> The high places also of
Aven, the sin of Israel, will be destroyed. The thorn and the thistle
will come up on their altars. They will tell the mountains, “Cover us!”
and the hills, “Fall on us!” <span class="bibleverse">9</span> “Israel,
you have sinned from the days of Gibeah. There they remained. The battle
against the children of iniquity doesn’t overtake them in Gibeah. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> When it is my desire, I will chastise them;
and the nations will be gathered against them when they are bound to
their two transgressions. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> Ephraim is
a trained heifer that loves to thresh, so I will put a yoke on her
beautiful neck. I will set a rider on Ephraim. Judah will plow. Jacob
will break his clods. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> Sow to
yourselves in righteousness, reap according to kindness. Break up your
fallow ground, for it is time to seek Yahweh, until he comes and rains
righteousness on you. <span class="bibleverse">13</span> You have plowed
wickedness. You have reaped iniquity. You have eaten the fruit of lies,
for you trusted in your way, in the multitude of your mighty men. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> Therefore a battle roar will arise among
your people, and all your fortresses will be destroyed, as Shalman
destroyed Beth Arbel in the day of battle. The mother was dashed in
pieces with her children. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> So Bethel
will do to you because of your great wickedness. At daybreak the king of
Israel will be destroyed.</p>
<h1 id="section-10">11</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> “When Israel was a child, then I
loved him, and called my son out of Egypt. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> They called to them, so they went from them.
They sacrificed to the Baals, and burned incense to engraved images.
<span class="bibleverse">3</span> Yet I taught Ephraim to walk. I took
them by their arms, but they didn’t know that I healed them. <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> I drew them with cords of a man, with ties
of love; and I was to them like those who lift up the yoke on their
necks; and I bent down to him and I fed him. <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> “They won’t return into the land of Egypt;
but the Assyrian will be their king, because they refused to repent.
<span class="bibleverse">6</span> The sword will fall on their cities,
and will destroy the bars of their gates, and will put an end to their
plans. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> My people are determined to
turn from me. Though they call to the Most High, he certainly won’t
exalt them. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> “How can I give you up,
Ephraim? How can I hand you over, Israel? How can I make you like Admah?
How can I make you like Zeboiim? My heart is turned within me, my
compassion is aroused. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> I will not
execute the fierceness of my anger. I will not return to destroy
Ephraim, for I am God, and not man—the Holy One among you. I will not
come in wrath. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> They will walk after
Yahweh, who will roar like a lion; for he will roar, and the children
will come trembling from the west. <span class="bibleverse">11</span>
They will come trembling like a bird out of Egypt, and like a dove out
of the land of Assyria; and I will settle them in their houses,” says
Yahweh. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> Ephraim surrounds me with
falsehood, and the house of Israel with deceit. Judah still strays from
God, and is unfaithful to the Holy One.</p>
<h1 id="section-11">12</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Ephraim feeds on wind, and chases
the east wind. He continually multiplies lies and desolation. They make
a covenant with Assyria, and oil is carried into Egypt. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> Yahweh also has a controversy with Judah,
and will punish Jacob according to his ways; according to his deeds he
will repay him. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> In the womb he took
his brother by the heel, and in his manhood he contended with God. <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> Indeed, he struggled with the angel, and
prevailed; he wept, and made supplication to him. He found him at
Bethel, and there he spoke with us— <span class="bibleverse">5</span>
even Yahweh, the God of Armies. Yahweh is his name of renown! <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> Therefore turn to your God. Keep kindness
and justice, and wait continually for your God. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> A merchant has dishonest scales in his hand.
He loves to defraud. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> Ephraim said,
“Surely I have become rich. I have found myself wealth. In all my wealth
they won’t find in me any iniquity that is sin.” <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> “But I am Yahweh your God from the land of
Egypt. I will yet again make you dwell in tents, as in the days of the
solemn feast. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> I have also spoken to
the prophets, and I have multiplied visions; and by the ministry of the
prophets I have used parables. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> If
Gilead is wicked, surely they are worthless. In Gilgal they sacrifice
bulls. Indeed, their altars are like heaps in the furrows of the field.
<span class="bibleverse">12</span> Jacob fled into the country of Aram.
Israel served to get a wife. For a wife he tended flocks and herds.
<span class="bibleverse">13</span> By a prophet Yahweh brought Israel up
out of Egypt, and by a prophet he was preserved. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> Ephraim has bitterly provoked anger.
Therefore his blood will be left on him, and his Lord<a href="#fn9"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>
will repay his contempt.</p>
<h1 id="section-12">13</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> When Ephraim spoke, there was
trembling. He exalted himself in Israel, but when he became guilty
through Baal, he died. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> Now they sin
more and more, and have made themselves molten images of their silver,
even idols according to their own understanding, all of them the work of
the craftsmen. They say of them, ‘They offer human sacrifice and kiss
the calves.’ <span class="bibleverse">3</span> Therefore they will be
like the morning mist, like the dew that passes away early, like the
chaff that is driven with the whirlwind out of the threshing floor, and
like the smoke out of the chimney. <span class="bibleverse">4</span>
“Yet I am Yahweh your God from the land of Egypt; and you shall
acknowledge no god but me, and besides me there is no savior. <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> I knew you in the wilderness, in the land of
great drought. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> According to their
pasture, so were they filled; they were filled, and their heart was
exalted. Therefore they have forgotten me. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> Therefore I am like a lion to them. Like a
leopard, I will lurk by the path. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> I
will meet them like a bear that is bereaved of her cubs, and will tear
the covering of their heart. There I will devour them like a lioness.
The wild animal will tear them. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> You
are destroyed, Israel, because you are against me, against your helper.
<span class="bibleverse">10</span> Where is your king now, that he may
save you in all your cities? And your judges, of whom you said, ‘Give me
a king and princes’? <span class="bibleverse">11</span> I have given you
a king in my anger, and have taken him away in my wrath. <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> The guilt of Ephraim is stored up. His sin
is stored up. <span class="bibleverse">13</span> The sorrows of a
travailing woman will come on him. He is an unwise son, for when it is
time, he doesn’t come to the opening of the womb. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> I will ransom them from the power of
Sheol.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> I will redeem them from death!
Death, where are your plagues? Sheol, where is your destruction?
“Compassion will be hidden from my eyes. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> Though he is fruitful among his brothers,
an east wind will come, the breath of Yahweh coming up from the
wilderness; and his spring will become dry, and his fountain will be
dried up. He will plunder the storehouse of treasure. <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> Samaria will bear her guilt, for she has
rebelled against her God. They will fall by the sword. Their infants
will be dashed in pieces, and their pregnant women will be ripped
open.”</p>
<h1 id="section-13">14</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Israel, return to Yahweh your God;
for you have fallen because of your sin. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> Take words with you, and return to Yahweh.
Tell him, “Forgive all our sins, and accept that which is good; so we
offer bulls as we vowed of our lips. <span class="bibleverse">3</span>
Assyria can’t save us. We won’t ride on horses; neither will we say any
more to the work of our hands, ‘Our gods!’ for in you the fatherless
finds mercy.” <span class="bibleverse">4</span> “I will heal their
waywardness. I will love them freely; for my anger is turned away from
them. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> I will be like the dew to
Israel. He will blossom like the lily, and send down his roots like
Lebanon. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> His branches will spread, and
his beauty will be like the olive tree, and his fragrance like Lebanon.
<span class="bibleverse">7</span> Men will dwell in his shade. They will
revive like the grain, and blossom like the vine. Their fragrance will
be like the wine of Lebanon. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> Ephraim,
what have I to do any more with idols? I answer, and will take care of
him. I am like a green cypress tree; from me your fruit is found.” <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> Who is wise, that he may understand these
things? Who is prudent, that he may know them? For the ways of Yahweh
are right, and the righteous walk in them, but the rebellious stumble in
them.</p>
