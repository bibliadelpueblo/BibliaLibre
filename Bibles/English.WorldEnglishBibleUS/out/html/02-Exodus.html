<h2 id="the-children-of-israel-multiplied">The children of Israel
multiplied</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Now these are the names of the sons
of Israel, who came into Egypt (every man and his household came with
Jacob): <span class="bibleverse">2</span> Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and
Judah, <span class="bibleverse">3</span> Issachar, Zebulun, and
Benjamin, <span class="bibleverse">4</span> Dan and Naphtali, Gad and
Asher. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> All the souls who came out of
Jacob’s body were seventy souls, and Joseph was in Egypt already. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> Joseph died, as did all his brothers, and
all that generation. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> The children of
Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and grew
exceedingly mighty; and the land was filled with them. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> Now there arose a new king over Egypt, who
didn’t know Joseph. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> He said to his
people, “Behold,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> the people of the children of Israel
are more and mightier than we. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> Come,
let’s deal wisely with them, lest they multiply, and it happen that when
any war breaks out, they also join themselves to our enemies and fight
against us, and escape out of the land.” <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> Therefore they set taskmasters over them to
afflict them with their burdens. They built storage cities for Pharaoh:
Pithom and Raamses. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> But the more they
afflicted them, the more they multiplied and the more they spread out.
They started to dread the children of Israel. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> The Egyptians ruthlessly made the children
of Israel serve, <span class="bibleverse">14</span> and they made their
lives bitter with hard service in mortar and in brick, and in all kinds
of service in the field, all their service, in which they ruthlessly
made them serve.</p>
<h2 id="the-fear-of-god-of-the-two-midwives">The fear of God of the two
midwives</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">15</span> The king of Egypt spoke to the
Hebrew midwives, of whom the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name
of the other Puah, <span class="bibleverse">16</span> and he said, “When
you perform the duty of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them on
the birth stool, if it is a son, then you shall kill him; but if it is a
daughter, then she shall live.” <span class="bibleverse">17</span> But
the midwives feared God,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> and didn’t do what the king of Egypt
commanded them, but saved the baby boys alive. <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> The king of Egypt called for the midwives,
and said to them, “Why have you done this thing and saved the boys
alive?” <span class="bibleverse">19</span> The midwives said to Pharaoh,
“Because the Hebrew women aren’t like the Egyptian women; for they are
vigorous and give birth before the midwife comes to them.” <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> God dealt well with the midwives, and the
people multiplied, and grew very mighty. <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> Because the midwives feared God, he gave
them families. <span class="bibleverse">22</span> Pharaoh commanded all
his people, saying, “You shall cast every son who is born into the
river, and every daughter you shall save alive.”</p>

<h2 id="birth-and-abandonment-salvation-and-education-of-moses">Birth
and abandonment, salvation and education of Moses</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> A man of the house of Levi went and
took a daughter of Levi as his wife. <span class="bibleverse">2</span>
The woman conceived and bore a son. When she saw that he was a fine
child, she hid him three months. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> When
she could no longer hide him, she took a papyrus basket for him, and
coated it with tar and with pitch. She put the child in it, and laid it
in the reeds by the river’s bank. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> His
sister stood far off, to see what would be done to him. <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> Pharaoh’s daughter came down to bathe at the
river. Her maidens walked along by the riverside. She saw the basket
among the reeds, and sent her servant to get it. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> She opened it, and saw the child, and
behold, the baby cried. She had compassion on him, and said, “This is
one of the Hebrews’ children.” <span class="bibleverse">7</span> Then
his sister said to Pharaoh’s daughter, “Should I go and call a nurse for
you from the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for you?” <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Go.” The
young woman went and called the child’s mother. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Take this
child away, and nurse him for me, and I will give you your wages.” The
woman took the child, and nursed it. <span class="bibleverse">10</span>
The child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh’s daughter, and he became
her son. She named him Moses,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> and said, “Because I
drew him out of the water.”</p>
<h2 id="moses-killed-the-egyptian">Moses killed the Egyptian</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">11</span> In those days, when Moses had
grown up, he went out to his brothers and saw their burdens. He saw an
Egyptian striking a Hebrew, one of his brothers. <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> He looked this way and that way, and when
he saw that there was no one, he killed the Egyptian, and hid him in the
sand. <span class="bibleverse">13</span> He went out the second day, and
behold, two men of the Hebrews were fighting with each other. He said to
him who did the wrong, “Why do you strike your fellow?” <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> He said, “Who made you a prince and a judge
over us? Do you plan to kill me, as you killed the Egyptian?” Moses was
afraid, and said, “Surely this thing is known.”</p>
<h2 id="moses-fled-to-midian-and-marries-sephora">Moses fled to Midian
and marries Sephora</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">15</span> Now when Pharaoh heard this thing,
he sought to kill Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and
lived in the land of Midian, and he sat down by a well. <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> Now the priest of Midian had seven
daughters. They came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water
their father’s flock. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> The shepherds
came and drove them away; but Moses stood up and helped them, and
watered their flock. <span class="bibleverse">18</span> When they came
to Reuel, their father, he said, “How is it that you have returned so
early today?” <span class="bibleverse">19</span> They said, “An Egyptian
delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and moreover he drew
water for us, and watered the flock.” <span class="bibleverse">20</span>
He said to his daughters, “Where is he? Why is it that you have left the
man? Call him, that he may eat bread.” <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> Moses was content to dwell with the man. He
gave Moses Zipporah, his daughter. <span class="bibleverse">22</span>
She bore a son, and he named him Gershom,<a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> for
he said, “I have lived as a foreigner in a foreign land.”</p>
<h2 id="god-hears-the-afflictions-of-the-oppressed-israelites">God hears
the afflictions of the oppressed Israelites</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">23</span> In the course of those many days,
the king of Egypt died, and the children of Israel sighed because of the
bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up to God because of the
bondage. <span class="bibleverse">24</span> God heard their groaning,
and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with
Jacob. <span class="bibleverse">25</span> God saw the children of
Israel, and God understood.</p>

<h2 id="god-reveals-himself-to-moses-in-the-bush-as-the-i-am">God

<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Now Moses was keeping the flock of
Jethro, his father-in-law, the priest of Midian, and he led the flock to
the back of the wilderness, and came to God’s mountain, to Horeb. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> Yahweh’s<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> angel appeared to him in
a flame of fire out of the middle of a bush. He looked, and behold, the
bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> Moses said, “I will go now, and see this
great sight, why the bush is not burned.” <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> When Yahweh saw that he came over to see,
God called to him out of the middle of the bush, and said, “Moses!
Moses!” He said, “Here I am.” <span class="bibleverse">5</span> He said,
“Don’t come close. Take off your sandals, for the place you are standing
on is holy ground.” <span class="bibleverse">6</span> Moreover he said,
“I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and
the God of Jacob.” Moses hid his face because he was afraid to look at
God. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> Yahweh said, “I have surely seen
the affliction of my people who are in Egypt, and have heard their cry
because of their taskmasters, for I know their sorrows. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> I have come down to deliver them out of the
hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land to a good
and large land, to a land flowing with milk and honey; to the place of
the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and
the Jebusite. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> Now, behold, the cry of
the children of Israel has come to me. Moreover I have seen the
oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> Come now therefore, and I will send you to
Pharaoh, that you may bring my people, the children of Israel, out of
Egypt.” <span class="bibleverse">11</span> Moses said to God, “Who am I,
that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should bring the children of
Israel out of Egypt?” <span class="bibleverse">12</span> He said,
“Certainly I will be with you. This will be the token to you, that I
have sent you: when you have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall
serve God on this mountain.”</p>
<h2 id="the-revelation-of-the-name-of-god">The revelation of the name of

<p><span class="bibleverse">13</span> Moses said to God, “Behold, when I
come to the children of Israel, and tell them, ‘The God of your fathers
has sent me to you,’ and they ask me, ‘What is his name?’ what should I
tell them?” <span class="bibleverse">14</span> God said to Moses, “I AM
WHO I AM,” and he said, “You shall tell the children of Israel this: ‘I
AM has sent me to you.’” <span class="bibleverse">15</span> God said
moreover to Moses, “You shall tell the children of Israel this, ‘Yahweh,
the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the
God of Jacob, has sent me to you.’ This is my name forever, and this is
my memorial to all generations.</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">16</span> Go and gather the elders of Israel
together, and tell them, ‘Yahweh, the God of your fathers, the God of
Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, has appeared to me, saying, “I have
surely visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt. <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> I have said, I will bring you up out of the
affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the
Amorite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, to a land flowing
with milk and honey.”’ <span class="bibleverse">18</span> They will
listen to your voice. You shall come, you and the elders of Israel, to
the king of Egypt, and you shall tell him, ‘Yahweh, the God of the
Hebrews, has met with us. Now please let us go three days’ journey into
the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to Yahweh, our God.’ <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> I know that the king of Egypt won’t give
you permission to go, no, not by a mighty hand. <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> I will reach out my hand and strike Egypt
with all my wonders which I will do among them, and after that he will
let you go. <span class="bibleverse">21</span> I will give this people
favor in the sight of the Egyptians, and it will happen that when you
go, you shall not go empty-handed. <span class="bibleverse">22</span>
But every woman shall ask of her neighbor, and of her who visits her
house, jewels of silver, jewels of gold, and clothing. You shall put

<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Moses answered, “But, behold, they

has not appeared to you.’” <span class="bibleverse">2</span> Yahweh said
to him, “What is that in your hand?” He said, “A rod.” <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> He said, “Throw it on the ground.” He threw
it on the ground, and it became a snake; and Moses ran away from it.
<span class="bibleverse">4</span> Yahweh said to Moses, “Stretch out
your hand, and take it by the tail.” He stretched out his hand, and took
hold of it, and it became a rod in his hand. <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> “This is so that they may believe that
Yahweh, the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac,
and the God of Jacob, has appeared to you.” <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> Yahweh said furthermore to him, “Now put
your hand inside your cloak.” He put his hand inside his cloak, and when
he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous, as white as snow. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> He said, “Put your hand inside your cloak
again.” He put his hand inside his cloak again, and when he took it out
of his cloak, behold, it had turned again as his other flesh. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> “It will happen, if they will not believe
you or listen to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the
voice of the latter sign. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> It will
happen, if they will not believe even these two signs or listen to your
voice, that you shall take of the water of the river, and pour it on the

him, “Who made man’s mouth? Or who makes one mute, or deaf, or seeing,
or blind? Isn’t it I, Yahweh? <span class="bibleverse">12</span> Now
therefore go, and I will be with your mouth, and teach you what you
shall speak.” <span class="bibleverse">13</span> Moses said, “Oh, Lord,
please send someone else.” <span class="bibleverse">14</span> Yahweh’s
anger burned against Moses, and he said, “What about Aaron, your
brother, the Levite? I know that he can speak well. Also, behold, he is
coming out to meet you. When he sees you, he will be glad in his heart.
<span class="bibleverse">15</span> You shall speak to him, and put the
words in his mouth. I will be with your mouth, and with his mouth, and
will teach you what you shall do. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> He

brothers who are in Egypt, and see whether they are still alive.” Jethro
said to Moses, “Go in peace.” <span class="bibleverse">19</span> Yahweh
said to Moses in Midian, “Go, return into Egypt; for all the men who
sought your life are dead.” <span class="bibleverse">20</span> Moses
took his wife and his sons, and set them on a donkey, and he returned to
the land of Egypt. Moses took God’s rod in his hand. <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> Yahweh said to Moses, “When you go back
into Egypt, see that you do before Pharaoh all the wonders which I have
put in your hand, but I will harden his heart and he will not let the
people go. <span class="bibleverse">22</span> You shall tell Pharaoh,
‘Yahweh says, Israel is my son, my firstborn, <span

foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet; and she said, “Surely you
are a bridegroom of blood to me.” <span class="bibleverse">26</span> So
he let him alone. Then she said, “You are a bridegroom of blood,”

Yahweh’s words with which he had sent him, and all the signs with which
he had instructed him. <span class="bibleverse">29</span> Moses and
Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of
Israel. <span class="bibleverse">30</span> Aaron spoke all the words

<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Afterward Moses and Aaron came, and

class="bibleverse">2</span> Pharaoh said, “Who is Yahweh, that I should
listen to his voice to let Israel go? I don’t know Yahweh, and moreover
I will not let Israel go.” <span class="bibleverse">3</span> They said,
“The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Please let us go three days’

<span class="bibleverse">8</span> You shall require from them the number

it, for they are idle. Therefore they cry, saying, ‘Let’s go and
sacrifice to our God.’ <span class="bibleverse">9</span> Let heavier
work be laid on the men, that they may labor in it. Don’t let them pay
any attention to lying words.” <span class="bibleverse">10</span> The
taskmasters of the people went out with their officers, and they spoke
to the people, saying, “This is what Pharaoh says: ‘I will not give you
straw. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> Go yourselves, get straw where
you can find it, for nothing of your work shall be diminished.’” <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> So the people were scattered abroad
throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw. <span

“Fulfill your work quota daily, as when there was straw!” <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> The officers of the children of Israel,
whom Pharaoh’s taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and were
asked, “Why haven’t you fulfilled your quota both yesterday and today,
in making brick as before?” <span class="bibleverse">15</span> Then the
officers of the children of Israel came and cried to Pharaoh, saying,
“Why do you deal this way with your servants? <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> No straw is given to your servants, and
they tell us, ‘Make brick!’ and behold, your servants are beaten; but
the fault is in your own people.” <span class="bibleverse">17</span> But
Pharaoh said, “You are idle! You are idle! Therefore you say, ‘Let’s go
and sacrifice to Yahweh.’ <span class="bibleverse">18</span> Go
therefore now, and work; for no straw shall be given to you; yet you
shall deliver the same number of bricks!” <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> The officers of the children of Israel saw
that they were in trouble when it was said, “You shall not diminish
anything from your daily quota of bricks!” <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> They met Moses and Aaron, who stood along
the way, as they came out from Pharaoh. <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> They said to them, “May Yahweh look at you

are that Aaron and Moses to whom Yahweh said, “Bring out the children of
Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies.” <span

mission of Moses and Aaron before the pharaoh</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">28</span> On the day when Yahweh spoke to
Moses in the land of Egypt, <span class="bibleverse">29</span> Yahweh
said to Moses, “I am Yahweh. Tell Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I tell
you.” <span class="bibleverse">30</span> Moses said before Yahweh,
“Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips, and how shall Pharaoh listen to
me?”</p>
<h1 id="section-6">7</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Yahweh said to Moses, “Behold, I
have made you as God to Pharaoh; and Aaron your brother shall be your
prophet. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> You shall speak all that I
command you; and Aaron your brother shall speak to Pharaoh, that he let
the children of Israel go out of his land. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and multiply
my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt. <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> But Pharaoh will not listen to you, so I
will lay my hand on Egypt, and bring out my armies, my people the
children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments. <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> The Egyptians shall know that I am Yahweh
when I stretch out my hand on Egypt, and bring the children of Israel
out from among them.” <span class="bibleverse">6</span> Moses and Aaron
did so. As Yahweh commanded them, so they did. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> Moses was eighty years old, and Aaron
eighty-three years old, when they spoke to Pharaoh.</p>
<h2 id="transformation-from-staff-to-snake">Transformation from staff to

<p><span class="bibleverse">8</span> Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron,
saying, <span class="bibleverse">9</span> “When Pharaoh speaks to you,
saying, ‘Perform a miracle!’ then you shall tell Aaron, ‘Take your rod,
and cast it down before Pharaoh, and it will become a serpent.’” <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh, and
they did so, as Yahweh had commanded. Aaron cast down his rod before
Pharaoh and before his servants, and it became a serpent. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> Then Pharaoh also called for the wise men
and the sorcerers. They also, the magicians of Egypt, did the same thing
with their enchantments. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> For they
each cast down their rods, and they became serpents; but Aaron’s rod
swallowed up their rods. <span class="bibleverse">13</span> Pharaoh’s
heart was hardened, and he didn’t listen to them, as Yahweh had
spoken.</p>

heart is stubborn. He refuses to let the people go. <span

going out to the water. You shall stand by the river’s bank to meet him.
You shall take the rod which was turned to a serpent in your hand. <span

Hebrews, has sent me to you, saying, “Let my people go, that they may
serve me in the wilderness. Behold, until now you haven’t listened.”
<span class="bibleverse">17</span> Yahweh says, “In this you shall know
that I am Yahweh. Behold: I will strike with the rod that is in my hand
on the waters which are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood.
<span class="bibleverse">18</span> The fish that are in the river will
die and the river will become foul. The Egyptians will loathe to drink
water from the river.”’” <span class="bibleverse">19</span> Yahweh said
to Moses, “Tell Aaron, ‘Take your rod, and stretch out your hand over
the waters of Egypt, over their rivers, over their streams, and over
their pools, and over all their ponds of water, that they may become
blood. There will be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in
vessels of wood and in vessels of stone.’” <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> Moses and Aaron did so, as Yahweh
commanded; and he lifted up the rod, and struck the waters that were in
the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants;
and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood. <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> The fish that were in the river died. The
river became foul. The Egyptians couldn’t drink water from the river.
The blood was throughout all the land of Egypt. <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> The magicians of Egypt did the same thing
with their enchantments. So Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he didn’t
listen to them, as Yahweh had spoken. <span class="bibleverse">23</span>
Pharaoh turned and went into his house, and he didn’t even take this to
heart. <span class="bibleverse">24</span> All the Egyptians dug around
the river for water to drink; for they couldn’t drink the river water.

Yahweh had struck the river.</p>

<h2 id="the-second-plague-of-frogs">The second plague of frogs</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Yahweh spoke to Moses, “Go in to
Pharaoh, and tell him, ‘This is what Yahweh says, “Let my people go,
that they may serve me. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> If you refuse

go up and come into your house, and into your bedroom, and on your bed,
and into the house of your servants, and on your people, and into your
ovens, and into your kneading troughs. <span class="bibleverse">4</span>
The frogs shall come up both on you, and on your people, and on all your
servants.”’” <span class="bibleverse">5</span> Yahweh said to Moses,
“Tell Aaron, ‘Stretch out your hand with your rod over the rivers, over
the streams, and over the pools, and cause frogs to come up on the land
of Egypt.’” <span class="bibleverse">6</span> Aaron stretched out his
hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the
land of Egypt. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> The magicians did the
same thing with their enchantments, and brought up frogs on the land of
Egypt. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> Then Pharaoh called for Moses
and Aaron, and said, “Entreat Yahweh, that he take away the frogs from
me and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may
sacrifice to Yahweh.” <span class="bibleverse">9</span> Moses said to
Pharaoh, “I give you the honor of setting the time that I should pray
for you, and for your servants, and for your people, that the frogs be
destroyed from you and your houses, and remain in the river only.” <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> Pharaoh said, “Tomorrow.” Moses said, “Let
it be according to your word, that you may know that there is no one
like Yahweh our God. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> The frogs shall
depart from you, and from your houses, and from your servants, and from
your people. They shall remain in the river only.” <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh, and
Moses cried to Yahweh concerning the frogs which he had brought on
Pharaoh. <span class="bibleverse">13</span> Yahweh did according to the
word of Moses, and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the courts,
and out of the fields. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> They gathered
them together in heaps, and the land stank. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> But when Pharaoh saw that there was a
respite, he hardened his heart, and didn’t listen to them, as Yahweh had
spoken.</p>
<h2 id="the-third-plague-mosquitoes">The third plague: Mosquitoes</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">16</span> Yahweh said to Moses, “Tell Aaron,
‘Stretch out your rod, and strike the dust of the earth, that it may
become lice throughout all the land of Egypt.’” <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> They did so; and Aaron stretched out his
hand with his rod, and struck the dust of the earth, and there were lice
on man, and on animal; all the dust of the earth became lice throughout
all the land of Egypt. <span class="bibleverse">18</span> The magicians
tried with their enchantments to produce lice, but they couldn’t. There
were lice on man, and on animal. <span class="bibleverse">19</span> Then
the magicians said to Pharaoh, “This is God’s finger;” but Pharaoh’s
heart was hardened, and he didn’t listen to them, as Yahweh had
spoken.</p>
<h2 id="fourth-plague-dog-flies">Fourth plague: dog flies</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">20</span> Yahweh said to Moses, “Rise up

the water; and tell him, ‘This is what Yahweh says, “Let my people go,
that they may serve me. <span class="bibleverse">21</span> Else, if you
will not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies on you,
and on your servants, and on your people, and into your houses. The
houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the
ground they are on. <span class="bibleverse">22</span> I will set apart
in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms
of flies shall be there, to the end you may know that I am Yahweh on the
earth. <span class="bibleverse">23</span> I will put a division between
my people and your people. This sign shall happen by tomorrow.”’” <span
class="bibleverse">24</span> Yahweh did so; and there came grievous
swarms of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants’
houses. In all the land of Egypt the land was corrupted by reason of the
swarms of flies. <span class="bibleverse">25</span> Pharaoh called for
Moses and for Aaron, and said, “Go, sacrifice to your God in the land!”
<span class="bibleverse">26</span> Moses said, “It isn’t appropriate to
do so; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to Yahweh
our God. Behold, if we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before
their eyes, won’t they stone us? <span class="bibleverse">27</span> We
will go three days’ journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to Yahweh
our God, as he shall command us.” <span class="bibleverse">28</span>
Pharaoh said, “I will let you go, that you may sacrifice to Yahweh your
God in the wilderness, only you shall not go very far away. Pray for
me.” <span class="bibleverse">29</span> Moses said, “Behold, I am going
out from you. I will pray to Yahweh that the swarms of flies may depart
from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, tomorrow; only
don’t let Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go
to sacrifice to Yahweh.” <span class="bibleverse">30</span> Moses went
out from Pharaoh, and prayed to Yahweh. <span
class="bibleverse">31</span> Yahweh did according to the word of Moses,
and he removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and
from his people. There remained not one. <span
class="bibleverse">32</span> Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also,
and he didn’t let the people go.</p>
<h1 id="section-8">9</h1>
<h2 id="fifth-plague-livestock-plague">Fifth Plague: Livestock

<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Then Yahweh said to Moses, “Go in
to Pharaoh, and tell him, ‘This is what Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews,
says: “Let my people go, that they may serve me. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> For if you refuse to let them go, and hold
them still, <span class="bibleverse">3</span> behold, Yahweh’s hand is
on your livestock which are in the field, on the horses, on the donkeys,
on the camels, on the herds, and on the flocks with a very grievous
pestilence. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> Yahweh will make a
distinction between the livestock of Israel and the livestock of Egypt;
and nothing shall die of all that belongs to the children of Israel.”’”
<span class="bibleverse">5</span> Yahweh appointed a set time, saying,
“Tomorrow Yahweh shall do this thing in the land.” <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> Yahweh did that thing on the next day; and
all the livestock of Egypt died, but of the livestock of the children of
Israel, not one died. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> Pharaoh sent,
and, behold, there was not so much as one of the livestock of the
Israelites dead. But the heart of Pharaoh was stubborn, and he didn’t
let the people go.</p>
<h2 id="the-sixth-plague-tumors">The sixth plague: tumors</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">8</span> Yahweh said to Moses and to Aaron,
“Take handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward
the sky in the sight of Pharaoh. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> It
shall become small dust over all the land of Egypt, and shall be boils
and blisters breaking out on man and on animal, throughout all the land
of Egypt.” <span class="bibleverse">10</span> They took ashes of the
furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it up toward the
sky; and it became boils and blisters breaking out on man and on animal.
<span class="bibleverse">11</span> The magicians couldn’t stand before
Moses because of the boils; for the boils were on the magicians and on
all the Egyptians. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> Yahweh hardened
the heart of Pharaoh, and he didn’t listen to them, as Yahweh had spoken
to Moses.</p>
<h2 id="the-seventh-plague-the-hail">The seventh plague: the hail</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">13</span> Yahweh said to Moses, “Rise up
early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and tell him, ‘This is
what Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, says: “Let my people go, that they
may serve me. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> For this time I will
send all my plagues against your heart, against your officials, and
against your people; that you may know that there is no one like me in
all the earth. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> For now I would have
stretched out my hand, and struck you and your people with pestilence,
and you would have been cut off from the earth; <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> but indeed for this cause I have made you
stand: to show you my power, and that my name may be declared throughout
all the earth, <span class="bibleverse">17</span> because you still
exalt yourself against my people, that you won’t let them go. <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> Behold, tomorrow about this time I will
cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as has not been in Egypt
since the day it was founded even until now. <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> Now therefore command that all of your
livestock and all that you have in the field be brought into shelter.
The hail will come down on every man and animal that is found in the
field, and isn’t brought home, and they will die.”’” <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> Those who feared Yahweh’s word among the
servants of Pharaoh made their servants and their livestock flee into
the houses. <span class="bibleverse">21</span> Whoever didn’t respect
Yahweh’s word left his servants and his livestock in the field. <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> Yahweh said to Moses, “Stretch out your
hand toward the sky, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, on
man, and on animal, and on every herb of the field, throughout the land
of Egypt.” <span class="bibleverse">23</span> Moses stretched out his
rod toward the heavens, and Yahweh sent thunder and hail; and lightning
flashed down to the earth. Yahweh rained hail on the land of Egypt.
<span class="bibleverse">24</span> So there was very severe hail, and
lightning mixed with the hail, such as had not been in all the land of
Egypt since it became a nation. <span class="bibleverse">25</span> The
hail struck throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field,
both man and animal; and the hail struck every herb of the field, and
broke every tree of the field. <span class="bibleverse">26</span> Only
in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, there was no
hail. <span class="bibleverse">27</span> Pharaoh sent and called for
Moses and Aaron, and said to them, “I have sinned this time. Yahweh is
righteous, and I and my people are wicked. <span
class="bibleverse">28</span> Pray to Yahweh; for there has been enough
of mighty thunderings and hail. I will let you go, and you shall stay no
longer.” <span class="bibleverse">29</span> Moses said to him, “As soon
as I have gone out of the city, I will spread out my hands to Yahweh.
The thunders shall cease, and there will not be any more hail; that you
may know that the earth is Yahweh’s. <span class="bibleverse">30</span>
But as for you and your servants, I know that you don’t yet fear Yahweh
God.” <span class="bibleverse">31</span> The flax and the barley were
struck, for the barley had ripened and the flax was blooming. <span
class="bibleverse">32</span> But the wheat and the spelt were not
struck, for they had not grown up. <span class="bibleverse">33</span>
Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread out his hands to
Yahweh; and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured on
the earth. <span class="bibleverse">34</span> When Pharaoh saw that the
rain and the hail and the thunders had ceased, he sinned yet more, and
hardened his heart, he and his servants. <span
class="bibleverse">35</span> The heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he
didn’t let the children of Israel go, just as Yahweh had spoken through
Moses.</p>
<h1 id="section-9">10</h1>
<h2 id="the-eighth-plague-locusts">The Eighth Plague: Locusts</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Yahweh said to Moses, “Go in to
Pharaoh, for I have hardened his heart and the heart of his servants,
that I may show these my signs among them; <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> and that you may tell in the hearing of your
son, and of your son’s son, what things I have done to Egypt, and my
signs which I have done among them; that you may know that I am Yahweh.”
<span class="bibleverse">3</span> Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh,
and said to him, “This is what Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, says:
‘How long will you refuse to humble yourself before me? Let my people
go, that they may serve me. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> Or else,
if you refuse to let my people go, behold, tomorrow I will bring locusts
into your country, <span class="bibleverse">5</span> and they shall
cover the surface of the earth, so that one won’t be able to see the
earth. They shall eat the residue of that which has escaped, which
remains to you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which grows for
you out of the field. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> Your houses
shall be filled, and the houses of all your servants, and the houses of
all the Egyptians, as neither your fathers nor your fathers’ fathers
have seen, since the day that they were on the earth to this day.’” He
turned, and went out from Pharaoh. <span class="bibleverse">7</span>
Pharaoh’s servants said to him, “How long will this man be a snare to
us? Let the men go, that they may serve Yahweh, their God. Don’t you yet
know that Egypt is destroyed?” <span class="bibleverse">8</span> Moses
and Aaron were brought again to Pharaoh, and he said to them, “Go, serve
Yahweh your God; but who are those who will go?” <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> Moses said, “We will go with our young and
with our old. We will go with our sons and with our daughters, with our
flocks and with our herds; for we must hold a feast to Yahweh.” <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> He said to them, “Yahweh be with you if I
let you go with your little ones! See, evil is clearly before your
faces. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> Not so! Go now you who are
men, and serve Yahweh; for that is what you desire!” Then they were
driven out from Pharaoh’s presence. <span class="bibleverse">12</span>
Yahweh said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt for
the locusts, that they may come up on the land of Egypt, and eat every
herb of the land, even all that the hail has left.” <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> Moses stretched out his rod over the land
of Egypt, and Yahweh brought an east wind on the land all that day, and
all night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.
<span class="bibleverse">14</span> The locusts went up over all the land
of Egypt, and rested in all the borders of Egypt. They were very
grievous. Before them there were no such locusts as they, nor will there
ever be again. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> For they covered the
surface of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened, and they ate
every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail
had left. There remained nothing green, either tree or herb of the
field, through all the land of Egypt. <span class="bibleverse">16</span>
Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste, and he said, “I have
sinned against Yahweh your God, and against you. <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> Now therefore please forgive my sin again,
and pray to Yahweh your God, that he may also take away from me this
death.” <span class="bibleverse">18</span> Moses went out from Pharaoh,
and prayed to Yahweh. <span class="bibleverse">19</span> Yahweh sent an
exceedingly strong west wind, which took up the locusts, and drove them
into the Red Sea.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> There remained not one locust in all
the borders of Egypt. <span class="bibleverse">20</span> But Yahweh

go.</p>
<h2 id="the-ninth-plague-darkness">The ninth plague: darkness</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">21</span> Yahweh said to Moses, “Stretch out
your hand toward the sky, that there may be darkness over the land of
Egypt, even darkness which may be felt.” <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> Moses stretched out his hand toward the
sky, and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt for three
days. <span class="bibleverse">23</span> They didn’t see one another,
and nobody rose from his place for three days; but all the children of
Israel had light in their dwellings. <span class="bibleverse">24</span>
Pharaoh called to Moses, and said, “Go, serve Yahweh. Only let your
flocks and your herds stay behind. Let your little ones also go with
you.” <span class="bibleverse">25</span> Moses said, “You must also give
into our hand sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice to
Yahweh our God. <span class="bibleverse">26</span> Our livestock also
shall go with us. Not a hoof shall be left behind, for of it we must
take to serve Yahweh our God; and we don’t know with what we must serve
Yahweh, until we come there.” <span class="bibleverse">27</span> But
Yahweh hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he wouldn’t let them go. <span
class="bibleverse">28</span> Pharaoh said to him, “Get away from me! Be
careful to see my face no more; for in the day you see my face you shall
die!” <span class="bibleverse">29</span> Moses said, “You have spoken
well. I will see your face again no more.”</p>

class="bibleverse">2</span> Speak now in the ears of the people, and let
every man ask of his neighbor, and every woman of her neighbor, jewels
of silver, and jewels of gold.” <span class="bibleverse">3</span> Yahweh
gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover, the man
Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh’s
servants, and in the sight of the people. <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> Moses said, “This is what Yahweh says:
‘About midnight I will go out into the middle of Egypt, <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> and all the firstborn in the land of Egypt
shall die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sits on his throne, even to
the firstborn of the female servant who is behind the mill, and all the
firstborn of livestock. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> There will be
a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there has not
been, nor will be any more. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> But
against any of the children of Israel a dog won’t even bark or move its
tongue, against man or animal, that you may know that Yahweh makes a
distinction between the Egyptians and Israel. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> All these servants of yours will come down
to me, and bow down themselves to me, saying, “Get out, with all the
people who follow you;” and after that I will go out.’” He went out from
Pharaoh in hot anger. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> Yahweh said to
Moses, “Pharaoh won’t listen to you, that my wonders may be multiplied
in the land of Egypt.” <span class="bibleverse">10</span> Moses and
Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh, but Yahweh hardened
Pharaoh’s heart, and he didn’t let the children of Israel go out of his
land.</p>

a lamb for a household; <span class="bibleverse">4</span> and if the
household is too little for a lamb, then he and his neighbor next to his
house shall take one according to the number of the souls. You shall
make your count for the lamb according to what everyone can eat. <span

haste: it is Yahweh’s Passover. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> For I
will go through the land of Egypt in that night, and will strike all the

you. You shall keep it as a feast to Yahweh. You shall keep it as a
feast throughout your generations by an ordinance forever. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> “‘Seven days you shall eat unleavened
bread; even the first day you shall put away yeast out of your houses,
for whoever eats leavened bread from the first day until the seventh
day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel. <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> In the first day there shall be to you a
holy convocation, and in the seventh day a holy convocation; no kind of
work shall be done in them, except that which every man must eat, only
that may be done by you. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> You shall
observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in this same day I have
brought your armies out of the land of Egypt. Therefore you shall
observe this day throughout your generations by an ordinance forever.
<span class="bibleverse">18</span> In the first month, on the fourteenth
day of the month at evening, you shall eat unleavened bread, until the
twenty first day of the month at evening. <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> There shall be no yeast found in your
houses for seven days, for whoever eats that which is leavened, that
soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he is a
foreigner, or one who is born in the land. <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> You shall eat nothing leavened. In all your
habitations you shall eat unleavened bread.’”</p>
<h2 id="moses-teaches-the-elders-the-precepts-about-the-passover">Moses
teaches the elders the precepts about the Passover</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">21</span> Then Moses called for all the
elders of Israel, and said to them, “Draw out, and take lambs according
to your families, and kill the Passover. <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> You shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip
it in the blood that is in the basin, and strike the lintel and the two
door posts with the blood that is in the basin. None of you shall go out
of the door of his house until the morning. <span
class="bibleverse">23</span> For Yahweh will pass through to strike the
Egyptians; and when he sees the blood on the lintel, and on the two door
posts, Yahweh will pass over the door, and will not allow the destroyer
to come in to your houses to strike you. <span
class="bibleverse">24</span> You shall observe this thing for an
ordinance to you and to your sons forever. <span
class="bibleverse">25</span> It shall happen when you have come to the
land which Yahweh will give you, as he has promised, that you shall keep
this service. <span class="bibleverse">26</span> It will happen, when
your children ask you, ‘What do you mean by this service?’ <span
class="bibleverse">27</span> that you shall say, ‘It is the sacrifice of
Yahweh’s Passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel
in Egypt, when he struck the Egyptians, and spared our houses.’” The
people bowed their heads and worshiped. <span
class="bibleverse">28</span> The children of Israel went and did so; as
Yahweh had commanded Moses and Aaron, so they did.</p>
<h2 id="the-tenth-plague-the-death-of-the-egyptian-firstborn">The tenth
plague: the death of the Egyptian firstborn</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">29</span> At midnight, Yahweh struck all the
firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sat on
his throne to the firstborn of the captive who was in the dungeon, and
all the firstborn of livestock. <span class="bibleverse">30</span>
Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the
Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt, for there was not a house
where there was not one dead. <span class="bibleverse">31</span> He
called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, “Rise up, get out from
among my people, both you and the children of Israel; and go, serve
Yahweh, as you have said! <span class="bibleverse">32</span> Take both
your flocks and your herds, as you have said, and be gone; and bless me
also!” <span class="bibleverse">33</span> The Egyptians were urgent with
the people, to send them out of the land in haste, for they said, “We
are all dead men.” <span class="bibleverse">34</span> The people took
their dough before it was leavened, their kneading troughs being bound
up in their clothes on their shoulders. <span
class="bibleverse">35</span> The children of Israel did according to the
word of Moses; and they asked of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and
jewels of gold, and clothing. <span class="bibleverse">36</span> Yahweh
gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they let
them have what they asked. They plundered the Egyptians.</p>
<h2 id="the-exodus-of-israel-from-egypt">The exodus of Israel from
Egypt</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">37</span> The children of Israel traveled
from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot who were
men, in addition to children. <span class="bibleverse">38</span> A mixed
multitude went up also with them, with flocks, herds, and even very much
livestock. <span class="bibleverse">39</span> They baked unleavened
cakes of the dough which they brought out of Egypt; for it wasn’t
leavened, because they were thrust out of Egypt, and couldn’t wait, and
they had not prepared any food for themselves. <span
class="bibleverse">40</span> Now the time that the children of Israel
lived in Egypt was four hundred thirty years. <span
class="bibleverse">41</span> At the end of four hundred thirty years, to
the day, all of Yahweh’s armies went out from the land of Egypt. <span
class="bibleverse">42</span> It is a night to be much observed to Yahweh
for bringing them out from the land of Egypt. This is that night of
Yahweh, to be much observed by all the children of Israel throughout
their generations.</p>
<h2 id="passover-ordinance-sanctification-of-the-firstborn">Passover
Ordinance; Sanctification of the firstborn</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">43</span> Yahweh said to Moses and Aaron,
“This is the ordinance of the Passover. No foreigner shall eat of it,
<span class="bibleverse">44</span> but every man’s servant who is bought
for money, when you have circumcised him, then shall he eat of it. <span
class="bibleverse">45</span> A foreigner and a hired servant shall not
eat of it. <span class="bibleverse">46</span> It must be eaten in one
house. You shall not carry any of the meat outside of the house. Do not
break any of its bones. <span class="bibleverse">47</span> All the
congregation of Israel shall keep it. <span class="bibleverse">48</span>
When a stranger lives as a foreigner with you, and would like to keep
the Passover to Yahweh, let all his males be circumcised, and then let
him come near and keep it. He shall be as one who is born in the land;
but no uncircumcised person shall eat of it. <span
class="bibleverse">49</span> One law shall be to him who is born at
home, and to the stranger who lives as a foreigner among you.” <span
class="bibleverse">50</span> All the children of Israel did so. As
Yahweh commanded Moses and Aaron, so they did. <span
class="bibleverse">51</span> That same day, Yahweh brought the children
of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.</p>
<h1 id="section-12">13</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
<span class="bibleverse">2</span> “Sanctify to me all the firstborn,
whatever opens the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of
animal. It is mine.”</p>
<h2

regulations on the celebration of the Feast of Unleavened Bread</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">3</span> Moses said to the people, “Remember
this day, in which you came out of Egypt, out of the house of bondage;
for by strength of hand Yahweh brought you out from this place. No
leavened bread shall be eaten. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> Today
you go out in the month Abib. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> It shall
be, when Yahweh brings you into the land of the Canaanite, and the
Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, which he
swore to your fathers to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey,
that you shall keep this service in this month. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread,
and in the seventh day shall be a feast to Yahweh. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> Unleavened bread shall be eaten throughout
the seven days; and no leavened bread shall be seen with you. No yeast
shall be seen with you, within all your borders. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> You shall tell your son in that day, saying,
‘It is because of that which Yahweh did for me when I came out of
Egypt.’ <span class="bibleverse">9</span> It shall be for a sign to you
on your hand, and for a memorial between your eyes, that Yahweh’s law
may be in your mouth; for with a strong hand Yahweh has brought you out
of Egypt. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> You shall therefore keep
this ordinance in its season from year to year.</p>
<h2 id="sanctification-of-the-firstborn">Sanctification of the

<p><span class="bibleverse">11</span> “It shall be, when Yahweh brings
you into the land of the Canaanite, as he swore to you and to your
fathers, and will give it to you, <span class="bibleverse">12</span>
that you shall set apart to Yahweh all that opens the womb, and every
firstborn that comes from an animal which you have. The males shall be
Yahweh’s. <span class="bibleverse">13</span> Every firstborn of a donkey
you shall redeem with a lamb; and if you will not redeem it, then you
shall break its neck; and you shall redeem all the firstborn of man
among your sons. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> It shall be, when
your son asks you in time to come, saying, ‘What is this?’ that you
shall tell him, ‘By strength of hand Yahweh brought us out from Egypt,
from the house of bondage. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> When
Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go, Yahweh killed all the firstborn
in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man, and the firstborn of
livestock. Therefore I sacrifice to Yahweh all that opens the womb,
being males; but all the firstborn of my sons I redeem.’ <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> It shall be for a sign on your hand, and
for symbols between your eyes; for by strength of hand Yahweh brought us
out of Egypt.”</p>

the desert and the Red Sea to Etham</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">17</span> When Pharaoh had let the people
go, God didn’t lead them by the way of the land of the Philistines,
although that was near; for God said, “Lest perhaps the people change
their minds when they see war, and they return to Egypt”; <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> but God led the people around by the way of
the wilderness by the Red Sea; and the children of Israel went up armed
out of the land of Egypt. <span class="bibleverse">19</span> Moses took
the bones of Joseph with him, for he had made the children of Israel
swear, saying, “God will surely visit you, and you shall carry up my
bones away from here with you.” <span class="bibleverse">20</span> They
took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in the edge of
the wilderness. <span class="bibleverse">21</span> Yahweh went before
them by day in a pillar of cloud, to lead them on their way, and by
night in a pillar of fire, to give them light, that they might go by day
and by night: <span class="bibleverse">22</span> the pillar of cloud by
day, and the pillar of fire by night, didn’t depart from before the
people.</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
<span class="bibleverse">2</span> “Speak to the children of Israel, that
they turn back and encamp before Pihahiroth, between Migdol and the sea,
before Baal Zephon. You shall encamp opposite it by the sea. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel,
‘They are entangled in the land. The wilderness has shut them in.’ <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and he will
follow after them; and I will get honor over Pharaoh, and over all his
armies; and the Egyptians shall know that I am Yahweh.” They did so.</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">5</span> The king of Egypt was told that the
people had fled; and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was
changed toward the people, and they said, “What is this we have done,
that we have let Israel go from serving us?” <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> He prepared his chariot, and took his army
with him; <span class="bibleverse">7</span> and he took six hundred
chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, with captains over all
of them. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> Yahweh hardened the heart of
Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued the children of Israel; for the
children of Israel went out with a high hand.<a href="#fn8"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>
<span class="bibleverse">9</span> The Egyptians pursued them. All the

<h2 id="moses-encourages-discouraged-israelites-gods-intervention">Moses

<p><span class="bibleverse">10</span> When Pharaoh came near, the
children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and behold, the Egyptians were
marching after them; and they were very afraid. The children of Israel
cried out to Yahweh. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> They said to
Moses, “Because there were no graves in Egypt, have you taken us away to
die in the wilderness? Why have you treated us this way, to bring us out
of Egypt? <span class="bibleverse">12</span> Isn’t this the word that we
spoke to you in Egypt, saying, ‘Leave us alone, that we may serve the
Egyptians?’ For it would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians
than to die in the wilderness.” <span class="bibleverse">13</span> Moses
said to the people, “Don’t be afraid. Stand still, and see the salvation
of Yahweh, which he will work for you today; for you will never again
see the Egyptians whom you have seen today. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> Yahweh will fight for you, and you shall be
still.” <span class="bibleverse">15</span> Yahweh said to Moses, “Why do
you cry to me? Speak to the children of Israel, that they go forward.
<span class="bibleverse">16</span> Lift up your rod, and stretch out
your hand over the sea and divide it. Then the children of Israel shall
go into the middle of the sea on dry ground. <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> Behold, I myself will harden the hearts of
the Egyptians, and they will go in after them. I will get myself honor
over Pharaoh, and over all his armies, over his chariots, and over his
horsemen. <span class="bibleverse">18</span> The Egyptians shall know
that I am Yahweh when I have gotten myself honor over Pharaoh, over his
chariots, and over his horsemen.” <span class="bibleverse">19</span> The
angel of God, who went before the camp of Israel, moved and went behind
them; and the pillar of cloud moved from before them, and stood behind
them. <span class="bibleverse">20</span> It came between the camp of
Egypt and the camp of Israel. There was the cloud and the darkness, yet
it gave light by night. One didn’t come near the other all night.</p>

of the Israelites through the Red Sea; fall of the egyptians</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">21</span> Moses stretched out his hand over
the sea, and Yahweh caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all
night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided. <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> The children of Israel went into the middle
of the sea on the dry ground; and the waters were a wall to them on
their right hand and on their left. <span class="bibleverse">23</span>
The Egyptians pursued, and went in after them into the middle of the
sea: all of Pharaoh’s horses, his chariots, and his horsemen. <span
class="bibleverse">24</span> In the morning watch, Yahweh looked out on
the Egyptian army through the pillar of fire and of cloud, and confused
the Egyptian army. <span class="bibleverse">25</span> He took off their
chariot wheels, and they drove them heavily; so that the Egyptians said,
“Let’s flee from the face of Israel, for Yahweh fights for them against
the Egyptians!” <span class="bibleverse">26</span> Yahweh said to Moses,
“Stretch out your hand over the sea, that the waters may come again on
the Egyptians, on their chariots, and on their horsemen.” <span
class="bibleverse">27</span> Moses stretched out his hand over the sea,
and the sea returned to its strength when the morning appeared; and the
Egyptians fled against it. Yahweh overthrew the Egyptians in the middle
of the sea. <span class="bibleverse">28</span> The waters returned, and
covered the chariots and the horsemen, even all Pharaoh’s army that went
in after them into the sea. There remained not so much as one of them.
<span class="bibleverse">29</span> But the children of Israel walked on
dry land in the middle of the sea, and the waters were a wall to them on
their right hand and on their left. <span class="bibleverse">30</span>
Thus Yahweh saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and
Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore. <span
class="bibleverse">31</span> Israel saw the great work which Yahweh did
to the Egyptians, and the people feared Yahweh; and they believed in
Yahweh and in his servant Moses.</p>

he has triumphed gloriously. He has thrown the horse and his rider into
the sea. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> Yah is my strength and song.
He has become my salvation. This is my God, and I will praise him; my
father’s God, and I will exalt him. <span class="bibleverse">3</span>
Yahweh is a man of war. Yahweh is his name. <span

into the sea. His chosen captains are sunk in the Red Sea. <span

the depths like a stone. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> Your right
hand, Yahweh, is glorious in power. Your right hand, Yahweh, dashes the
enemy in pieces. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> In the greatness of
your excellency, you overthrow those who rise up against you. You send
out your wrath. It consumes them as stubble. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> With the blast of your nostrils, the waters
were piled up. The floods stood upright as a heap. The deeps were
congealed in the heart of the sea. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> The
enemy said, ‘I will pursue. I will overtake. I will divide the plunder.
My desire will be satisfied on them. I will draw my sword. My hand will
destroy them.’ <span class="bibleverse">10</span> You blew with your
wind. The sea covered them. They sank like lead in the mighty waters.
<span class="bibleverse">11</span> Who is like you, Yahweh, among the
gods? Who is like you, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing
wonders? <span class="bibleverse">12</span> You stretched out your right
hand. The earth swallowed them. <span class="bibleverse">13</span> “You,
in your loving kindness, have led the people that you have redeemed. You
have guided them in your strength to your holy habitation. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> The peoples have heard. They tremble. Pangs
have taken hold of the inhabitants of Philistia. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> Then the chiefs of Edom were dismayed.
Trembling takes hold of the mighty men of Moab. All the inhabitants of
Canaan have melted away. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> Terror and
dread falls on them. By the greatness of your arm they are as still as a
stone, until your people pass over, Yahweh, until the people you have
purchased pass over. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> You will bring
them in, and plant them in the mountain of your inheritance, the place,
Yahweh, which you have made for yourself to dwell in: the sanctuary,
Lord, which your hands have established. <span

class="bibleverse">19</span> For the horses of Pharaoh went in with his
chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and Yahweh brought back the
waters of the sea on them; but the children of Israel walked on dry land
in the middle of the sea.</p>

There he made a statute and an ordinance for them, and there he tested

diligently listen to Yahweh your God’s voice, and will do that which is

of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt.
<span class="bibleverse">2</span> The whole congregation of the children
of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron in the wilderness;
<span class="bibleverse">3</span> and the children of Israel said to
them, “We wish that we had died by Yahweh’s hand in the land of Egypt,
when we sat by the meat pots, when we ate our fill of bread, for you
have brought us out into this wilderness to kill this whole assembly
with hunger.” <span class="bibleverse">4</span> Then Yahweh said to
Moses, “Behold, I will rain bread from the sky for you, and the people
shall go out and gather a day’s portion every day, that I may test them,
whether they will walk in my law or not. <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> It shall come to pass on the sixth day, that
they shall prepare that which they bring in, and it shall be twice as
much as they gather daily.” <span class="bibleverse">6</span> Moses and
Aaron said to all the children of Israel, “At evening, you shall know
that Yahweh has brought you out from the land of Egypt. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> In the morning, you shall see Yahweh’s
glory; because he hears your murmurings against Yahweh. Who are we, that
you murmur against us?” <span class="bibleverse">8</span> Moses said,
“Now Yahweh will give you meat to eat in the evening, and in the morning
bread to satisfy you, because Yahweh hears your murmurings which you
murmur against him. And who are we? Your murmurings are not against us,
but against Yahweh.” <span class="bibleverse">9</span> Moses said to
Aaron, “Tell all the congregation of the children of Israel, ‘Come close
to Yahweh, for he has heard your murmurings.’” <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> As Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of
the children of Israel, they looked toward the wilderness, and behold,
Yahweh’s glory appeared in the cloud. <span class="bibleverse">11</span>
Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, <span class="bibleverse">12</span> “I
have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel. Speak to them,
saying, ‘At evening you shall eat meat, and in the morning you shall be
filled with bread. Then you will know that I am Yahweh your God.’” <span

the camp; and in the morning the dew lay around the camp. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> When the dew that lay had gone, behold, on
the surface of the wilderness was a small round thing, small as the
frost on the ground. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> When the
children of Israel saw it, they said to one another, “What is it?” For
they didn’t know what it was. Moses said to them, “It is the bread which

your persons, you shall take it, every man for those who are in his
tent.’” <span class="bibleverse">17</span> The children of Israel did
so, and some gathered more, some less. <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> When they measured it with an omer, he who
gathered much had nothing over, and he who gathered little had no lack.
They each gathered according to his eating. <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> Moses said to them, “Let no one leave of it
until the morning.” <span class="bibleverse">20</span> Notwithstanding
they didn’t listen to Moses, but some of them left of it until the
morning, so it bred worms and became foul; and Moses was angry with
them. <span class="bibleverse">21</span> They gathered it morning by
morning, everyone according to his eating. When the sun grew hot, it
melted. <span class="bibleverse">22</span> On the sixth day, they
gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each one; and all the rulers
of the congregation came and told Moses. <span
class="bibleverse">23</span> He said to them, “This is that which Yahweh
has spoken, ‘Tomorrow is a solemn rest, a holy Sabbath to Yahweh. Bake
that which you want to bake, and boil that which you want to boil; and
all that remains over lay up for yourselves to be kept until the
morning.’” <span class="bibleverse">24</span> They laid it up until the
morning, as Moses ordered, and it didn’t become foul, and there were no
worms in it. <span class="bibleverse">25</span> Moses said, “Eat that
today, for today is a Sabbath to Yahweh. Today you shall not find it in
the field. <span class="bibleverse">26</span> Six days you shall gather
it, but on the seventh day is the Sabbath. In it there shall be none.”
<span class="bibleverse">27</span> On the seventh day, some of the
people went out to gather, and they found none. <span
class="bibleverse">28</span> Yahweh said to Moses, “How long do you
refuse to keep my commandments and my laws? <span

an omer-full of manna in it, and lay it up before Yahweh, to be kept
throughout your generations.” <span class="bibleverse">34</span> As
Yahweh commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be

according to Yahweh’s commandment, and encamped in Rephidim; but there
was no water for the people to drink. <span class="bibleverse">2</span>
Therefore the people quarreled with Moses, and said, “Give us water to
drink.” Moses said to them, “Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you test
Yahweh?” <span class="bibleverse">3</span> The people were thirsty for
water there; so the people murmured against Moses, and said, “Why have
you brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us, our children, and our
livestock with thirst?” <span class="bibleverse">4</span> Moses cried to
Yahweh, saying, “What shall I do with these people? They are almost
ready to stone me.” <span class="bibleverse">5</span> Yahweh said to
Moses, “Walk on before the people, and take the elders of Israel with
you, and take the rod in your hand with which you struck the Nile, and
go. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> Behold, I will stand before you
there on the rock in Horeb. You shall strike the rock, and water will
come out of it, that the people may drink.” Moses did so in the sight of

Joshua defeated Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword. <span

Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, and bowed and kissed him. They
asked each other of their welfare, and they came into the tent. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> Moses told his father-in-law all that Yahweh
had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel’s sake, all the
hardships that had come on them on the way, and how Yahweh delivered
them. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> Jethro rejoiced for all the
goodness which Yahweh had done to Israel, in that he had delivered them
out of the hand of the Egyptians. <span class="bibleverse">10</span>
Jethro said, “Blessed be Yahweh, who has delivered you out of the hand
of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh; who has delivered the
people from under the hand of the Egyptians. <span

<p><span class="bibleverse">13</span> On the next day, Moses sat to

thing that you do for the people? Why do you sit alone, and all the

the people come to me to inquire of God. <span

You are not able to perform it yourself alone. <span

counsel, and God be with you. You represent the people before God, and

teach them the statutes and the laws, and shall show them the way in
which they must walk, and the work that they must do. <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> Moreover you shall provide out of all the
people able men which fear God: men of truth, hating unjust gain; and
place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds,

you so, then you will be able to endure, and all these people also will

listened to the voice of his father-in-law, and did all that he had
said. <span class="bibleverse">25</span> Moses chose able men out of all
Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers

<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> In the third month after the

they came into the wilderness of Sinai. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> When they had departed from Rephidim, and
had come to the wilderness of Sinai, they encamped in the wilderness;
and there Israel encamped before the mountain. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> Moses went up to God, and Yahweh called to
him out of the mountain, saying, “This is what you shall tell the house
of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel: <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> ‘You have seen what I did to the Egyptians,
and how I bore you on eagles’ wings, and brought you to myself. <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> Now therefore, if you will indeed obey my

among all peoples; for all the earth is mine; <span

children of Israel.” <span class="bibleverse">7</span> Moses came and
called for the elders of the people, and set before them all these words
which Yahweh commanded him. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> All the
people answered together, and said, “All that Yahweh has spoken we will
do.” Moses reported the words of the people to Yahweh. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> Yahweh said to Moses, “Behold, I come to you
in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with you, and
may also believe you forever.” Moses told the words of the people to
Yahweh. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> Yahweh said to Moses, “Go to
the people, and sanctify them today and tomorrow, and let them wash
their garments, <span class="bibleverse">11</span> and be ready for the
third day; for on the third day Yahweh will come down in the sight of
all the people on Mount Sinai. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> You
shall set bounds to the people all around, saying, ‘Be careful that you
don’t go up onto the mountain, or touch its border. Whoever touches the
mountain shall be surely put to death. <span

surely be stoned or shot through; whether it is animal or man, he shall
not live.’ When the trumpet sounds long, they shall come up to the
mountain.” <span class="bibleverse">14</span> Moses went down from the
mountain to the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their
clothes. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> He said to the people, “Be
ready by the third day. Don’t have sexual relations with a woman.”</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">16</span> On the third day, when it was
morning, there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud on the
mountain, and the sound of an exceedingly loud trumpet; and all the
people who were in the camp trembled. <span class="bibleverse">17</span>
Moses led the people out of the camp to meet God; and they stood at the
lower part of the mountain. <span class="bibleverse">18</span> All of
Mount Sinai smoked, because Yahweh descended on it in fire; and its
smoke ascended like the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mountain
quaked greatly. <span class="bibleverse">19</span> When the sound of the
trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him by a
voice. <span class="bibleverse">20</span> Yahweh came down on Mount
Sinai, to the top of the mountain. Yahweh called Moses to the top of the
mountain, and Moses went up. <span class="bibleverse">21</span> Yahweh
said to Moses, “Go down, warn the people, lest they break through to
Yahweh to gaze, and many of them perish. <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> Let the priests also, who come near to
Yahweh, sanctify themselves, lest Yahweh break out on them.” <span
class="bibleverse">23</span> Moses said to Yahweh, “The people can’t
come up to Mount Sinai, for you warned us, saying, ‘Set bounds around
the mountain, and sanctify it.’” <span class="bibleverse">24</span>
Yahweh said to him, “Go down! You shall bring Aaron up with you, but
don’t let the priests and the people break through to come up to Yahweh,
lest he break out against them.” <span class="bibleverse">25</span> So
Moses went down to the people, and told them.</p>

<h2 id="make-and-worship-the-golden-image-of-the-bull">Make and worship

<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> When the people saw that Moses
delayed coming down from the mountain, the people gathered themselves
together to Aaron, and said to him, “Come, make us gods, which shall go
before us; for as for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the
land of Egypt, we don’t know what has become of him.” <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> Aaron said to them, “Take off the golden
rings, which are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your
daughters, and bring them to me.” <span class="bibleverse">3</span> All
the people took off the golden rings which were in their ears, and
brought them to Aaron. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> He received
what they handed him, fashioned it with an engraving tool, and made it a
molded calf. Then they said, “These are your gods, Israel, which brought
you up out of the land of Egypt.” <span class="bibleverse">5</span> When
Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made a
proclamation, and said, “Tomorrow shall be a feast to Yahweh.” <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> They rose up early on the next day, and
offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat
down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.</p>
<h2

informed by God of the apostasy of the people, descends from the

<p><span class="bibleverse">7</span> Yahweh spoke to Moses, “Go, get
down; for your people, whom you brought up out of the land of Egypt,
have corrupted themselves! <span class="bibleverse">8</span> They have
turned away quickly out of the way which I commanded them. They have
made themselves a molded calf, and have worshiped it, and have
sacrificed to it, and said, ‘These are your gods, Israel, which brought
you up out of the land of Egypt.’” <span class="bibleverse">9</span>
Yahweh said to Moses, “I have seen these people, and behold, they are a
stiff-necked people. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> Now therefore
leave me alone, that my wrath may burn hot against them, and that I may
consume them; and I will make of you a great nation.” <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> Moses begged Yahweh his God, and said,
“Yahweh, why does your wrath burn hot against your people, that you have
brought out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty
hand? <span class="bibleverse">12</span> Why should the Egyptians talk,
saying, ‘He brought them out for evil, to kill them in the mountains,
and to consume them from the surface of the earth?’ Turn from your
fierce wrath, and turn away from this evil against your people. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, your
servants, to whom you swore by your own self, and said to them, ‘I will
multiply your offspring<a href="#fn38" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref38"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>38</sup></a> as the stars of the sky, and all
this land that I have spoken of I will give to your offspring, and they
shall inherit it forever.’” <span class="bibleverse">14</span> So Yahweh
turned away from the evil which he said he would do to his people. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> Moses turned, and went down from the
mountain, with the two tablets of the covenant in his hand; tablets that
were written on both their sides. They were written on one side and on
the other. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> The tablets were the work
of God, and the writing was the writing of God, engraved on the tablets.
<span class="bibleverse">17</span> When Joshua heard the noise of the
people as they shouted, he said to Moses, “There is the noise of war in
the camp.” <span class="bibleverse">18</span> He said, “It isn’t the
voice of those who shout for victory. It is not the voice of those who
cry for being overcome; but the noise of those who sing that I
hear.”</p>
<h2

<p><span class="bibleverse">19</span> As soon as he came near to the
camp, he saw the calf and the dancing. Then Moses’ anger grew hot, and
he threw the tablets out of his hands, and broke them beneath the
mountain. <span class="bibleverse">20</span> He took the calf which they
had made, and burned it with fire, ground it to powder, and scattered it
on the water, and made the children of Israel drink it. <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> Moses said to Aaron, “What did these people
do to you, that you have brought a great sin on them?” <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> Aaron said, “Don’t let the anger of my lord
grow hot. You know the people, that they are set on evil. <span
class="bibleverse">23</span> For they said to me, ‘Make us gods, which
shall go before us. As for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of
the land of Egypt, we don’t know what has become of him.’ <span
class="bibleverse">24</span> I said to them, ‘Whoever has any gold, let
them take it off.’ So they gave it to me; and I threw it into the fire,
and out came this calf.” <span class="bibleverse">25</span> When Moses
saw that the people were out of control, (for Aaron had let them lose
control, causing derision among their enemies), <span
class="bibleverse">26</span> then Moses stood in the gate of the camp,
and said, “Whoever is on Yahweh’s side, come to me!” All the sons of
Levi gathered themselves together to him. <span
class="bibleverse">27</span> He said to them, “Yahweh, the God of
Israel, says, ‘Every man put his sword on his thigh, and go back and
forth from gate to gate throughout the camp, and every man kill his
brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbor.’”
<span class="bibleverse">28</span> The sons of Levi did according to the
word of Moses. About three thousand men fell of the people that day.
<span class="bibleverse">29</span> Moses said, “Consecrate yourselves
today to Yahweh, for every man was against his son and against his
brother, that he may give you a blessing today.”</p>
<h2 id="intercession-of-moses-for-the-people-gods-breath">Intercession

<p><span class="bibleverse">30</span> On the next day, Moses said to the
people, “You have sinned a great sin. Now I will go up to Yahweh.
Perhaps I shall make atonement for your sin.” <span
class="bibleverse">31</span> Moses returned to Yahweh, and said, “Oh,
this people have sinned a great sin, and have made themselves gods of
gold. <span class="bibleverse">32</span> Yet now, if you will, forgive
their sin—and if not, please blot me out of your book which you have
written.” <span class="bibleverse">33</span> Yahweh said to Moses,
“Whoever has sinned against me, I will blot him out of my book. <span
class="bibleverse">34</span> Now go, lead the people to the place of
which I have spoken to you. Behold, my angel shall go before you.
Nevertheless, in the day when I punish, I will punish them for their
sin.” <span class="bibleverse">35</span> Yahweh struck the people,
because of what they did with the calf, which Aaron made.</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Yahweh spoke to Moses, “Depart, go
up from here, you and the people that you have brought up out of the
land of Egypt, to the land of which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to
Jacob, saying, ‘I will give it to your offspring.’ <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> I will send an angel before you; and I will
drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the
Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> Go to a land flowing with milk and honey;
but I will not go up among you, for you are a stiff-necked people, lest
I consume you on the way.” <span class="bibleverse">4</span> When the
people heard this evil news, they mourned; and no one put on his
jewelry. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> Yahweh had said to Moses,
“Tell the children of Israel, ‘You are a stiff-necked people. If I were
to go up among you for one moment, I would consume you. Therefore now
take off your jewelry from you, that I may know what to do to you.’”
<span class="bibleverse">6</span> The children of Israel stripped
themselves of their jewelry from Mount Horeb onward.</p>

foundation and use of the reveal tent in front of the camp</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">7</span> Now Moses used to take the tent and
pitch it outside the camp, far away from the camp, and he called it “The
Tent of Meeting.” Everyone who sought Yahweh went out to the Tent of
Meeting, which was outside the camp. <span class="bibleverse">8</span>
When Moses went out to the Tent, all the people rose up, and stood,
everyone at their tent door, and watched Moses, until he had gone into
the Tent. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> When Moses entered into the
Tent, the pillar of cloud descended, stood at the door of the Tent, and
Yahweh spoke with Moses. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> All the
people saw the pillar of cloud stand at the door of the Tent, and all
the people rose up and worshiped, everyone at their tent door. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> Yahweh spoke to Moses face to face, as a
man speaks to his friend. He turned again into the camp, but his servant
Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, didn’t depart from the Tent.</p>

tell me, ‘Bring up this people;’ and you haven’t let me know whom you
will send with me. Yet you have said, ‘I know you by name, and you have
also found favor in my sight.’ <span class="bibleverse">13</span> Now
therefore, if I have found favor in your sight, please show me your way,
now, that I may know you, so that I may find favor in your sight; and
consider that this nation is your people.” <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> He said, “My presence will go with you, and
I will give you rest.” <span class="bibleverse">15</span> Moses said to
him, “If your presence doesn’t go with me, don’t carry us up from here.
<span class="bibleverse">16</span> For how would people know that I have
found favor in your sight, I and your people? Isn’t it that you go with
us, so that we are separated, I and your people, from all the people who
are on the surface of the earth?” <span class="bibleverse">17</span>
Yahweh said to Moses, “I will do this thing also that you have spoken;

goodness pass before you, and will proclaim Yahweh’s name before you. I
will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom
I will show mercy.” <span class="bibleverse">20</span> He said, “You
cannot see my face, for man may not see me and live.” <span

by me, and you shall stand on the rock. <span

that I will put you in a cleft of the rock, and will cover you with my

morning to Mount Sinai, and present yourself there to me on the top of

disobedience and sin; and who will by no means clear the guilty,
visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, and on the
children’s children, on the third and on the fourth generation.” <span

earth, and worshiped. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> He said, “If now
