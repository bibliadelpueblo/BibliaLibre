<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> That which was from the beginning,
that which we have heard, that which we have seen with our eyes, that
which we saw, and our hands touched, concerning the Word of life <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> (and the life was revealed, and we have
seen, and testify, and declare to you the life, the eternal life, which
was with the Father, and was revealed to us); <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> that which we have seen and heard we declare
to you, that you also may have fellowship with us. Yes, and our
fellowship is with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ.<a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> <span class="bibleverse">4</span>
And we write these things to you, that our joy may be fulfilled.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">5</span> This is the message which we have
heard from him and announce to you, that God is light, and in him is no
darkness at all. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> If we say that we
have fellowship with him and walk in the darkness, we lie and don’t tell
the truth. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> But if we walk in the light
as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the
blood of Jesus Christ his Son, cleanses us from all sin. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> If we say that we have no sin, we deceive
ourselves, and the truth is not in us. <span class="bibleverse">9</span>
If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous to forgive us the
sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> If we say that we haven’t sinned, we make
him a liar, and his word is not in us.</p>
<h1 id="section-1">2</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> My little children, I write these
things to you so that you may not sin. If anyone sins, we have a
Counselor<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> with the Father, Jesus Christ, the
righteous. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> And he is the atoning
sacrifice<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> for our sins, and not for ours only,
but also for the whole world. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> This is
how we know that we know him: if we keep his commandments. <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> One who says, “I know him,” and doesn’t keep
his commandments, is a liar, and the truth isn’t in him. <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> But God’s love has most certainly been
perfected in whoever keeps his word. This is how we know that we are in
him: <span class="bibleverse">6</span> he who says he remains in him
ought himself also to walk just like he walked.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">7</span> Brothers, I write no new
commandment to you, but an old commandment which you had from the
beginning. The old commandment is the word which you heard from the
beginning. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> Again, I write a new
commandment to you, which is true in him and in you, because the
darkness is passing away and the true light already shines. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> He who says he is in the light and hates his
brother is in the darkness even until now. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> He who loves his brother remains in the
light, and there is no occasion for stumbling in him. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> But he who hates his brother is in the
darkness, and walks in the darkness, and doesn’t know where he is going,
because the darkness has blinded his eyes.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">12</span> I write to you, little children,
because your sins are forgiven you for his name’s sake.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">13</span> I write to you, fathers, because
you know him who is from the beginning.</p>
<p>I write to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil
one.</p>
<p>I write to you, little children, because you know the Father.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">14</span> I have written to you, fathers,
because you know him who is from the beginning.</p>
<p>I have written to you, young men, because you are strong, and the
word of God remains in you, and you have overcome the evil one.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">15</span> Don’t love the world or the things
that are in the world. If anyone loves the world, the Father’s love
isn’t in him. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> For all that is in the
world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of
life—isn’t the Father’s, but is the world’s. <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> The world is passing away with its lusts,
but he who does God’s will remains forever.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">18</span> Little children, these are the end
times, and as you heard that the Antichrist is coming, even now many
antichrists have arisen. By this we know that it is the final hour.
<span class="bibleverse">19</span> They went out from us, but they
didn’t belong to us; for if they had belonged to us, they would have
continued with us. But they left, that they might be revealed that none
of them belong to us. <span class="bibleverse">20</span> You have an
anointing from the Holy One, and you all have knowledge.<a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>
<span class="bibleverse">21</span> I have not written to you because you
don’t know the truth, but because you know it, and because no lie is of
the truth. <span class="bibleverse">22</span> Who is the liar but he who
denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is the Antichrist, he who denies
the Father and the Son. <span class="bibleverse">23</span> Whoever
denies the Son doesn’t have the Father. He who confesses the Son has the
Father also.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">24</span> Therefore, as for you, let that
remain in you which you heard from the beginning. If that which you
heard from the beginning remains in you, you also will remain in the
Son, and in the Father. <span class="bibleverse">25</span> This is the
promise which he promised us, the eternal life.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">26</span> These things I have written to you
concerning those who would lead you astray. <span
class="bibleverse">27</span> As for you, the anointing which you
received from him remains in you, and you don’t need for anyone to teach
you. But as his anointing teaches you concerning all things, and is
true, and is no lie, and even as it taught you, you will remain in
him.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">28</span> Now, little children, remain in
him, that when he appears, we may have boldness and not be ashamed
before him at his coming. <span class="bibleverse">29</span> If you know
that he is righteous, you know that everyone who practices righteousness
has been born of him.</p>
<h1 id="section-2">3</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> See how great a love the Father has
given to us, that we should be called children of God! For this cause
the world doesn’t know us, because it didn’t know him. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> Beloved, now we are children of God. It is
not yet revealed what we will be; but we know that when he is revealed,
we will be like him, for we will see him just as he is. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> Everyone who has this hope set on him
purifies himself, even as he is pure.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">4</span> Everyone who sins also commits
lawlessness. Sin is lawlessness. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> You
know that he was revealed to take away our sins, and no sin is in him.
<span class="bibleverse">6</span> Whoever remains in him doesn’t sin.
Whoever sins hasn’t seen him and doesn’t know him.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">7</span> Little children, let no one lead
you astray. He who does righteousness is righteous, even as he is
righteous. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> He who sins is of the
devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. To this end
the Son of God was revealed: that he might destroy the works of the
devil. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> Whoever is born of God doesn’t
commit sin, because his seed remains in him, and he can’t sin, because
he is born of God. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> In this the
children of God are revealed, and the children of the devil. Whoever
doesn’t do righteousness is not of God, neither is he who doesn’t love
his brother. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> For this is the message
which you heard from the beginning, that we should love one another—
<span class="bibleverse">12</span> unlike Cain, who was of the evil one
and killed his brother. Why did he kill him? Because his deeds were
evil, and his brother’s righteous.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">13</span> Don’t be surprised, my brothers,
if the world hates you. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> We know that
we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brothers. He
who doesn’t love his brother remains in death. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> Whoever hates his brother is a murderer,
and you know that no murderer has eternal life remaining in him.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">16</span> By this we know love, because he
laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for the
brothers. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> But whoever has the world’s
goods and sees his brother in need, then closes his heart of compassion
against him, how does God’s love remain in him?</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">18</span> My little children, let’s not love
in word only, or with the tongue only, but in deed and truth. <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> And by this we know that we are of the
truth and persuade our hearts before him, <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> because if our heart condemns us, God is
greater than our heart, and knows all things. <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> Beloved, if our hearts don’t condemn us, we
have boldness toward God; <span class="bibleverse">22</span> so whatever
we ask, we receive from him, because we keep his commandments and do the
things that are pleasing in his sight. <span
class="bibleverse">23</span> This is his commandment, that we should
believe in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ, and love one another, even
as he commanded. <span class="bibleverse">24</span> He who keeps his
commandments remains in him, and he in him. By this we know that he
remains in us, by the Spirit which he gave us.</p>
<h1 id="section-3">4</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Beloved, don’t believe every
spirit, but test the spirits, whether they are of God, because many
false prophets have gone out into the world. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> By this you know the Spirit of God: every
spirit who confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God,
<span class="bibleverse">3</span> and every spirit who doesn’t confess
that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God; and this is the
spirit of the Antichrist, of whom you have heard that it comes. Now it
is in the world already. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> You are of
God, little children, and have overcome them, because greater is he who
is in you than he who is in the world. <span class="bibleverse">5</span>
They are of the world. Therefore they speak of the world, and the world
hears them. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> We are of God. He who
knows God listens to us. He who is not of God doesn’t listen to us. By
this we know the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">7</span> Beloved, let’s love one another,
for love is of God; and everyone who loves has been born of God and
knows God. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> He who doesn’t love doesn’t
know God, for God is love. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> By this
God’s love was revealed in us, that God has sent his only born<a
href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> Son into the world that we might
live through him. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> In this is love,
not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son as the
atoning sacrifice<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> for our sins. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> Beloved, if God loved us in this way, we
also ought to love one another. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> No
one has seen God at any time. If we love one another, God remains in us,
and his love has been perfected in us.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">13</span> By this we know that we remain in
him and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> We have seen and testify that the Father
has sent the Son as the Savior of the world. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of
God, God remains in him, and he in God. <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> We know and have believed the love which
God has for us. God is love, and he who remains in love remains in God,
and God remains in him. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> In this, love
has been made perfect among us, that we may have boldness in the day of
judgment, because as he is, even so we are in this world. <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> There is no fear in love; but perfect love
casts out fear, because fear has punishment. He who fears is not made
perfect in love. <span class="bibleverse">19</span> We love him,<a
href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> because he first loved us. <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> If a man says, “I love God,” and hates his
brother, he is a liar; for he who doesn’t love his brother whom he has
seen, how can he love God whom he has not seen? <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> This commandment we have from him, that he
who loves God should also love his brother.</p>
<h1 id="section-4">5</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Whoever believes that Jesus is the
Christ has been born of God. Whoever loves the Father also loves the
child who is born of him. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> By this we
know that we love the children of God, when we love God and keep his
commandments. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> For this is loving God,
that we keep his commandments. His commandments are not grievous. <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> For whatever is born of God overcomes the
world. This is the victory that has overcome the world: your faith.
<span class="bibleverse">5</span> Who is he who overcomes the world, but
he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">6</span> This is he who came by water and
blood, Jesus Christ; not with the water only, but with the water and the
blood. It is the Spirit who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth.
<span class="bibleverse">7</span> For there are three who testify:<a
href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> <span class="bibleverse">8</span>
the Spirit, the water, and the blood; and the three agree as one. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> If we receive the witness of men, the
witness of God is greater; for this is God’s testimony which he has
testified concerning his Son. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> He who
believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself. He who doesn’t
believe God has made him a liar, because he has not believed in the
testimony that God has given concerning his Son. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> The testimony is this: that God gave to us
eternal life, and this life is in his Son. <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> He who has the Son has the life. He who
doesn’t have God’s Son doesn’t have the life.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">13</span> These things I have written to you
who believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you
have eternal life, and that you may continue to believe in the name of
the Son of God.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">14</span> This is the boldness which we have
toward him, that if we ask anything according to his will, he listens to
us. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> And if we know that he listens to
us, whatever we ask, we know that we have the petitions which we have
asked of him.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">16</span> If anyone sees his brother sinning
a sin not leading to death, he shall ask, and God will give him life for
those who sin not leading to death. There is sin leading to death. I
don’t say that he should make a request concerning this. <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> All unrighteousness is sin, and there is
sin not leading to death.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">18</span> We know that whoever is born of
God doesn’t sin, but he who was born of God keeps himself, and the evil
one doesn’t touch him. <span class="bibleverse">19</span> We know that
we are of God, and the whole world lies in the power of the evil one.
<span class="bibleverse">20</span> We know that the Son of God has come
and has given us an understanding, that we know him who is true; and we
are in him who is true, in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God
and eternal life.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">21</span> Little children, keep yourselves
from idols.</p>
