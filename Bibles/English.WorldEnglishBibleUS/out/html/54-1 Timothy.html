<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ
according to the commandment of God our Savior and the Lord Jesus
Christ<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> our hope, <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> to Timothy, my true child in faith: Grace,
mercy, and peace from God our Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">3</span> As I urged you when I was going
into Macedonia, stay at Ephesus that you might command certain men not
to teach a different doctrine, <span class="bibleverse">4</span> and not
to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies, which cause disputes
rather than God’s stewardship, which is in faith. <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> But the goal of this command is love from a
pure heart, a good conscience, and sincere faith, <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> from which things some, having missed the
mark, have turned away to vain talking, <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> desiring to be teachers of the law, though
they understand neither what they say nor about what they strongly
affirm.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">8</span> But we know that the law is good if
a person uses it lawfully, <span class="bibleverse">9</span> as knowing
this, that law is not made for a righteous person, but for the lawless
and insubordinate, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and
profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for
manslayers, <span class="bibleverse">10</span> for the sexually immoral,
for homosexuals, for slave-traders, for liars, for perjurers, and for
any other thing contrary to the sound doctrine, <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> according to the Good News of the glory of
the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">12</span> I thank him who enabled me, Christ
Jesus our Lord, because he counted me faithful, appointing me to
service, <span class="bibleverse">13</span> although I used to be a
blasphemer, a persecutor, and insolent. However, I obtained mercy
because I did it ignorantly in unbelief. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> The grace of our Lord abounded exceedingly
with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> The saying is faithful and worthy of all
acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of
whom I am chief. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> However, for this
cause I obtained mercy, that in me first, Jesus Christ might display all
his patience for an example of those who were going to believe in him
for eternal life. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> Now to the King
eternal, immortal, invisible, to God who alone is wise, be honor and
glory forever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">18</span> I commit this instruction to you,
my child Timothy, according to the prophecies which were given to you
before, that by them you may wage the good warfare, <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> holding faith and a good conscience, which
some having thrust away made a shipwreck concerning the faith, <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> of whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I
delivered to Satan that they might be taught not to blaspheme.</p>
<h1 id="section-1">2</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> I exhort therefore, first of all,
that petitions, prayers, intercessions, and givings of thanks be made
for all men, <span class="bibleverse">2</span> for kings and all who are
in high places, that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all
godliness and reverence. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> For this is
good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior, <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> who desires all people to be saved and come
to full knowledge of the truth. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> For
there is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ
Jesus, <span class="bibleverse">6</span> who gave himself as a ransom
for all, the testimony at the proper time, <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> to which I was appointed a preacher and an
apostle—I am telling the truth in Christ, not lying—a teacher of the
Gentiles in faith and truth.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">8</span> I desire therefore that the men in
every place pray, lifting up holy hands without anger and doubting.
<span class="bibleverse">9</span> In the same way, that women also adorn
themselves in decent clothing, with modesty and propriety, not<a
href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> with braided hair, gold, pearls, or
expensive clothing, <span class="bibleverse">10</span> but with good
works, which is appropriate for women professing godliness. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> Let a woman learn in quietness with full
submission. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> But I don’t permit a
woman to teach, nor to exercise authority over a man, but to be in
quietness. <span class="bibleverse">13</span> For Adam was formed first,
then Eve. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> Adam wasn’t deceived, but
the woman, being deceived, has fallen into disobedience; <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> but she will be saved through her
childbearing, if they continue in faith, love, and holiness with
sobriety.</p>
<h1 id="section-2">3</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> This is a faithful saying: someone
who seeks to be an overseer<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> desires a good work.
<span class="bibleverse">2</span> The overseer therefore must be without
reproach, the husband of one wife, temperate, sensible, modest,
hospitable, good at teaching; <span class="bibleverse">3</span> not a
drinker, not violent, not greedy for money, but gentle, not quarrelsome,
not covetous; <span class="bibleverse">4</span> one who rules his own
house well, having children in subjection with all reverence; <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> (for how could someone who doesn’t know how
to rule his own house take care of God’s assembly?) <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> not a new convert, lest being puffed up he
fall into the same condemnation as the devil. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> Moreover he must have good testimony from
those who are outside, to avoid falling into reproach and the snare of
the devil.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">8</span> Servants,<a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> in
the same way, must be reverent, not double-tongued, not addicted to much
wine, not greedy for money, <span class="bibleverse">9</span> holding
the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> Let them also first be tested; then let
them serve<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> if they are blameless. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> Their wives in the same way must be
reverent, not slanderers, temperate, and faithful in all things. <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> Let servants<a href="#fn6"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> be
husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well.
<span class="bibleverse">13</span> For those who have served well<a
href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> gain for themselves a good standing
and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">14</span> These things I write to you,
hoping to come to you shortly, <span class="bibleverse">15</span> but if
I wait long, that you may know how men ought to behave themselves in
God’s house, which is the assembly of the living God, the pillar and
ground of the truth. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> Without
controversy, the mystery of godliness is great: God<a href="#fn8"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> was
revealed in the flesh, justified in the spirit, seen by angels, preached
among the nations, believed on in the world, and received up in
glory.</p>
<h1 id="section-3">4</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> But the Spirit says expressly that
in later times some will fall away from the faith, paying attention to
seducing spirits and doctrines of demons, <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> through the hypocrisy of men who speak lies,
branded in their own conscience as with a hot iron, <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> forbidding marriage and commanding to
abstain from foods which God created to be received with thanksgiving by
those who believe and know the truth. <span class="bibleverse">4</span>
For every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it
is received with thanksgiving. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> For it
is sanctified through the word of God and prayer.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">6</span> If you instruct the brothers of
these things, you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, nourished in
the words of the faith and of the good doctrine which you have followed.
<span class="bibleverse">7</span> But refuse profane and old wives’
fables. Exercise yourself toward godliness. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> For bodily exercise has some value, but
godliness has value in all things, having the promise of the life which
is now and of that which is to come. <span class="bibleverse">9</span>
This saying is faithful and worthy of all acceptance. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> For to this end we both labor and suffer
reproach, because we have set our trust in the living God, who is the
Savior of all men, especially of those who believe. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> Command and teach these things.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">12</span> Let no man despise your youth; but
be an example to those who believe, in word, in your way of life, in
love, in spirit, in faith, and in purity. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> Until I come, pay attention to reading, to
exhortation, and to teaching. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> Don’t
neglect the gift that is in you, which was given to you by prophecy with
the laying on of the hands of the elders. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> Be diligent in these things. Give yourself
wholly to them, that your progress may be revealed to all. <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> Pay attention to yourself and to your
teaching. Continue in these things, for in doing this you will save both
yourself and those who hear you.</p>
<h1 id="section-4">5</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Don’t rebuke an older man, but
exhort him as a father; the younger men as brothers; <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> the elder women as mothers; the younger as
sisters, in all purity.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">3</span> Honor widows who are widows indeed.
<span class="bibleverse">4</span> But if any widow has children or
grandchildren, let them learn first to show piety toward their own
family and to repay their parents, for this is<a href="#fn9"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>
acceptable in the sight of God. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> Now
she who is a widow indeed and desolate, has her hope set on God and
continues in petitions and prayers night and day. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> But she who gives herself to pleasure is
dead while she lives. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> Also command
these things, that they may be without reproach. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> But if anyone doesn’t provide for his own,
and especially his own household, he has denied the faith and is worse
than an unbeliever.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">9</span> Let no one be enrolled as a widow
under sixty years old, having been the wife of one man, <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> being approved by good works, if she has
brought up children, if she has been hospitable to strangers, if she has
washed the saints’ feet, if she has relieved the afflicted, and if she
has diligently followed every good work.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">11</span> But refuse younger widows, for
when they have grown wanton against Christ, they desire to marry, <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> having condemnation, because they have
rejected their first pledge. <span class="bibleverse">13</span> Besides,
they also learn to be idle, going about from house to house. Not only
idle, but also gossips and busybodies, saying things which they ought
not. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> I desire therefore that the
younger widows marry, bear children, rule the household, and give no
occasion to the adversary for insulting. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> For already some have turned away after
Satan. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> If any man or woman who
believes has widows, let them relieve them, and don’t let the assembly
be burdened, that it might relieve those who are widows indeed.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">17</span> Let the elders who rule well be
counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in the word
and in teaching. <span class="bibleverse">18</span> For the Scripture
says, “You shall not muzzle the ox when it treads out the grain.”<a
href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> And, “The laborer is worthy of his
wages.”<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">19</span> Don’t receive an accusation
against an elder except at the word of two or three witnesses. <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> Those who sin, reprove in the sight of all,
that the rest also may be in fear. <span class="bibleverse">21</span> I
command you in the sight of God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the
chosen angels, that you observe these things without prejudice, doing
nothing by partiality. <span class="bibleverse">22</span> Lay hands
hastily on no one. Don’t be a participant in other people’s sins. Keep
yourself pure.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">23</span> Be no longer a drinker of water
only, but use a little wine for your stomach’s sake and your frequent
infirmities.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">24</span> Some men’s sins are evident,
preceding them to judgment, and some also follow later. <span
class="bibleverse">25</span> In the same way also there are good works
that are obvious, and those that are otherwise can’t be hidden.</p>
<h1 id="section-5">6</h1>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Let as many as are bondservants
under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor, that the
name of God and the doctrine not be blasphemed. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> Those who have believing masters, let them
not despise them because they are brothers, but rather let them serve
them, because those who partake of the benefit are believing and
beloved. Teach and exhort these things.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">3</span> If anyone teaches a different
doctrine and doesn’t consent to sound words, the words of our Lord Jesus
Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness, <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> he is conceited, knowing nothing, but
obsessed with arguments, disputes, and word battles, from which come
envy, strife, insulting, evil suspicions, <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> constant friction of people of corrupt minds
and destitute of the truth, who suppose that godliness is a means of
gain. Withdraw yourself from such.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">6</span> But godliness with contentment is
great gain. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> For we brought nothing
into the world, and we certainly can’t carry anything out. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> But having food and clothing, we will be
content with that. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> But those who are
determined to be rich fall into a temptation, a snare, and many foolish
and harmful lusts, such as drown men in ruin and destruction. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> For the love of money is a root of all
kinds of evil. Some have been led astray from the faith in their greed,
and have pierced themselves through with many sorrows.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">11</span> But you, man of God, flee these
things, and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love,
perseverance, and gentleness. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> Fight
the good fight of faith. Take hold of the eternal life to which you were
called, and you confessed the good confession in the sight of many
witnesses. <span class="bibleverse">13</span> I command you before God
who gives life to all things, and before Christ Jesus who before Pontius
Pilate testified the good confession, <span class="bibleverse">14</span>
that you keep the commandment without spot, blameless until the
appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ, <span class="bibleverse">15</span>
which at the right time he will show, who is the blessed and only Ruler,
the King of kings and Lord of lords. <span class="bibleverse">16</span>
He alone has immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light, whom no man
has seen nor can see, to whom be honor and eternal power. Amen.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">17</span> Charge those who are rich in this
present age that they not be arrogant, nor have their hope set on the
uncertainty of riches, but on the living God, who richly provides us
with everything to enjoy; <span class="bibleverse">18</span> that they
do good, that they be rich in good works, that they be ready to
distribute, willing to share; <span class="bibleverse">19</span> laying
up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come,
that they may lay hold of eternal life.</p>
<p><span class="bibleverse">20</span> Timothy, guard that which is
committed to you, turning away from the empty chatter and oppositions of
what is falsely called knowledge, <span class="bibleverse">21</span>
which some profess, and thus have wandered from the faith.</p>
<p>Grace be with you. Amen.</p>
