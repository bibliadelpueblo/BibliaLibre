him; and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it on the horns of
the altar, and poured out the blood at the base of the altar; <span

his hand from there, and burned it upon the altar, in addition to the

the fat of the bull and of the ram, the fat tail, and that which covers
the innards, and the kidneys, and the cover of the liver; <span

devoured them, and they died before Yahweh. <span

Yahweh spoke of, saying, ‘I will show myself holy to those who come near
