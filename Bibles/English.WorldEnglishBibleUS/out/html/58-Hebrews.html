unique sovereignty of the Son of God over the Old Testament messengers
of God</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> God, having in the past spoken to
the fathers through the prophets at many times and in various ways,
<span class="bibleverse">2</span> has at the end of these days spoken to
us by his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, through whom also
he made the worlds. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> His Son is the
radiance of his glory, the very image of his substance, and upholding
all things by the word of his power, who, when he had by himself
purified us of our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on
high, <span class="bibleverse">4</span> having become as much better
than the angels as the more excellent name he has inherited is better
than theirs.</p>
<h2
id="old-testament-evidence-for-the-exaltation-of-the-son-of-god-over-the-angels">Old
Testament evidence for the exaltation of the Son of God over the
angels</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">5</span> For to which of the angels did he
say at any time, “You are my Son. Today I have become your father?”<a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> and again, “I will be to him a
Father, and he will be to me a Son?”<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> When he again brings in the firstborn into
the world he says, “Let all the angels of God worship him.”<a
href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> <span class="bibleverse">7</span> Of
the angels he says, “He makes his angels winds, and his servants a flame
of fire.”<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> <span class="bibleverse">8</span>
But of the Son he says, “Your throne, O God, is forever and ever. The
scepter of uprightness is the scepter of your Kingdom. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> You have loved righteousness and hated
iniquity; therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of
gladness above your fellows.”<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> And, “You, Lord, in the beginning, laid the
foundation of the earth. The heavens are the works of your hands. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> They will perish, but you continue. They
all will grow old like a garment does. <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> You will roll them up like a mantle, and
they will be changed; but you are the same. Your years won’t fail.”<a
href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> <span class="bibleverse">13</span>
But which of the angels has he told at any time, “Sit at my right hand,
until I make your enemies the footstool of your feet?”<a href="#fn7"

there arises the obligation that we voluntarily obey the words that this
Son has said to us</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Therefore we ought to pay greater
attention to the things that were heard, lest perhaps we drift away.
<span class="bibleverse">2</span> For if the word spoken through angels
proved steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a
just penalty, <span class="bibleverse">3</span> how will we escape if we
neglect so great a salvation—which at the first having been spoken
through the Lord, was confirmed to us by those who heard, <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> God also testifying with them, both by signs
and wonders, by various works of power, and by gifts of the Holy Spirit,
according to his own will?</p>
<h2

humiliation, incarnation and suffering of death, does not limit his
sublimity</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">5</span> For he didn’t subject the world to
come, of which we speak, to angels. <span class="bibleverse">6</span>
But one has somewhere testified, saying, “What is man, that you think of
him? Or the son of man, that you care for him? <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> You made him a little lower than the angels.
You crowned him with glory and honor.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> You have put all things in subjection under
his feet.”<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> For in that he subjected all things
to him, he left nothing that is not subject to him. But now we don’t yet
see all things subjected to him. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> But
we see him who has been made a little lower than the angels, Jesus,
because of the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor, that by
the grace of God he should taste of death for everyone.</p>
<h2 id="the-need-for-humiliation-especially-the-suffering-of-death">The
need for humiliation, especially the suffering of death</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">10</span> For it became him, for whom are
all things and through whom are all things, in bringing many children to
glory, to make the author of their salvation perfect through sufferings.
<span class="bibleverse">11</span> For both he who sanctifies and those
who are sanctified are all from one, for which cause he is not ashamed
to call them brothers,<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> <span class="bibleverse">12</span>
saying, “I will declare your name to my brothers. Among the congregation
I will sing your praise.”<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref"

<h2 id="the-beneficial-consequences-of-humiliation">The beneficial
consequences of humiliation</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">14</span> Since then the children have
shared in flesh and blood, he also himself in the same way partook of
the same, that through death he might bring to nothing him who had the
power of death, that is, the devil, <span class="bibleverse">15</span>
and might deliver all of them who through fear of death were all their
lifetime subject to bondage. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> For most
certainly, he doesn’t give help to angels, but he gives help to the
offspring<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> of Abraham. <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> Therefore he was obligated in all things to
be made like his brothers, that he might become a merciful and faithful
high priest in things pertaining to God, to make atonement for the sins
of the people. <span class="bibleverse">18</span> For in that he himself
has suffered being tempted, he is able to help those who are
tempted.</p>

<h2

Son of God Jesus in his majesty over the minister of God Moses</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Therefore, holy brothers, partakers
of a heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our
confession: Jesus, <span class="bibleverse">2</span> who was faithful to
him who appointed him, as also Moses was in all his house. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> For he has been counted worthy of more glory
than Moses, because he who built the house has more honor than the
house. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> For every house is built by
someone; but he who built all things is God. <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> Moses indeed was faithful in all his house
as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were afterward to be
spoken, <span class="bibleverse">6</span> but Christ<a href="#fn14"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>
is faithful as a Son over his house. We are his house, if we hold fast
our confidence and the glorying of our hope firm to the end.</p>
<h2 id="the-psalmists-warning-against-unbelief-and-apostasy">The
psalmist's warning against unbelief and apostasy</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">7</span> Therefore, even as the Holy Spirit
says, “Today if you will hear his voice, <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> don’t harden your hearts as in the
rebellion, in the day of the trial in the wilderness, <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> where your fathers tested me and tried me,
and saw my deeds for forty years. <span class="bibleverse">10</span>
Therefore I was displeased with that generation, and said, ‘They always
err in their heart, but they didn’t know my ways.’ <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> As I swore in my wrath, ‘They will not
enter into my rest.’”<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> <span class="bibleverse">12</span>
Beware, brothers, lest perhaps there might be in any one of you an evil
heart of unbelief, in falling away from the living God; <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> but exhort one another day by day, so long
as it is called “today”, lest any one of you be hardened by the
deceitfulness of sin.</p>
<h2 id="the-warning-example-of-the-israelites-in-the-desert">The warning
example of the Israelites in the desert</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">14</span> For we have become partakers of
Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence firm to the end,
<span class="bibleverse">15</span> while it is said, “Today if you will
hear his voice, don’t harden your hearts, as in the rebellion.”<a
href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> <span class="bibleverse">16</span>
For who, when they heard, rebelled? Wasn’t it all those who came out of
Egypt led by Moses? <span class="bibleverse">17</span> With whom was he
displeased forty years? Wasn’t it with those who sinned, whose bodies
fell in the wilderness? <span class="bibleverse">18</span> To whom did
he swear that they wouldn’t enter into his rest, but to those who were
disobedient? <span class="bibleverse">19</span> We see that they weren’t
able to enter in because of unbelief.</p>
<h1 id="section-3">4</h1>
<h2
id="interpretation-of-the-promise-of-the-psalm-on-the-rest-of-gods-people">Interpretation
of the promise of the psalm on the rest of God's people</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Let’s fear therefore, lest perhaps
anyone of you should seem to have come short of a promise of entering
into his rest. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> For indeed we have had
good news preached to us, even as they also did, but the word they heard
didn’t profit them, because it wasn’t mixed with faith by those who
heard. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> For we who have believed do
enter into that rest, even as he has said, “As I swore in my wrath, they
will not enter into my rest;”<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> although the works
were finished from the foundation of the world. <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> For he has said this somewhere about the
seventh day, “God rested on the seventh day from all his works;”<a
href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> <span class="bibleverse">5</span>
and in this place again, “They will not enter into my rest.”<a
href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> <span class="bibleverse">6</span>
Seeing therefore it remains that some should enter into it, and they to
whom the good news was preached before failed to enter in because of
disobedience, <span class="bibleverse">7</span> he again defines a
certain day, “today”, saying through David so long a time afterward
(just as has been said), “Today if you will hear his voice, don’t harden
your hearts.”<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> <span class="bibleverse">8</span>
For if Joshua had given them rest, he would not have spoken afterward of
another day. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> There remains therefore a
Sabbath rest for the people of God. <span class="bibleverse">10</span>
For he who has entered into his rest has himself also rested from his
works, as God did from his.</p>
<h2
id="final-exhortation-regarding-the-seriousness-and-power-of-the-word-of-god">Final
exhortation regarding the seriousness and power of the word of God</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">11</span> Let’s therefore give diligence to
enter into that rest, lest anyone fall after the same example of
disobedience. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> For the word of God is
living and active, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even
to the dividing of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and is
able to discern the thoughts and intentions of the heart. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> There is no creature that is hidden from
his sight, but all things are naked and laid open before the eyes of him
to whom we must give an account.</p>
<h2 id="jesus-knows-human-weaknesses-from-personal-experience">Jesus
knows human weaknesses from personal experience</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">14</span> Having then a great high priest
who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let’s hold
tightly to our confession. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> For we
don’t have a high priest who can’t be touched with the feeling of our
infirmities, but one who has been in all points tempted like we are, yet
without sin. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> Let’s therefore draw
near with boldness to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and
may find grace for help in time of need.</p>
<h1 id="section-4">5</h1>
<h2
id="with-christ-are-the-necessary-requirements-of-the-high-priest-suggested-in-melchizedek">With
Christ are the necessary requirements of the high priest suggested in
Melchizedek</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> For every high priest, being taken
from among men, is appointed for men in things pertaining to God, that
he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> The high priest can deal gently with those
who are ignorant and going astray, because he himself is also surrounded
with weakness. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> Because of this, he
must offer sacrifices for sins for the people, as well as for himself.
<span class="bibleverse">4</span> Nobody takes this honor on himself,
but he is called by God, just like Aaron was. <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> So also Christ didn’t glorify himself to be
made a high priest, but it was he who said to him, “You are my Son.
Today I have become your father.”<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> As he says also in another place, “You are a
priest forever, after the order of Melchizedek.”<a href="#fn22"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a>
<span class="bibleverse">7</span> He, in the days of his flesh, having
offered up prayers and petitions with strong crying and tears to him who
was able to save him from death, and having been heard for his godly
fear, <span class="bibleverse">8</span> though he was a Son, yet learned
obedience by the things which he suffered. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> Having been made perfect, he became to all
of those who obey him the author of eternal salvation, <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> named by God a high priest after the order
of Melchizedek.</p>

readers</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">11</span> About him we have many words to
say, and hard to interpret, seeing you have become dull of hearing.
<span class="bibleverse">12</span> For although by this time you should
be teachers, you again need to have someone teach you the rudiments of
the first principles of the revelations of God. You have come to need
milk, and not solid food. <span class="bibleverse">13</span> For
everyone who lives on milk is not experienced in the word of
righteousness, for he is a baby. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> But
solid food is for those who are full grown, who by reason of use have
their senses exercised to discern good and evil.</p>

<h2
id="its-a-matter-of-progress-relapse-is-dangerous-and-can-cause-incurable-damage">It's
a matter of progress; Relapse is dangerous and can cause incurable
damage</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Therefore leaving the teaching of
the first principles of Christ, let’s press on to perfection—not laying
again a foundation of repentance from dead works, of faith toward God,
<span class="bibleverse">2</span> of the teaching of baptisms, of laying
on of hands, of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> This will we do, if God permits. <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> For concerning those who were once
enlightened and tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of
the Holy Spirit, <span class="bibleverse">5</span> and tasted the good
word of God and the powers of the age to come, <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> and then fell away, it is impossible to
renew them again to repentance; seeing they crucify the Son of God for
themselves again, and put him to open shame. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> For the land which has drunk the rain that
comes often on it and produces a crop suitable for them for whose sake
it is also tilled, receives blessing from God; <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> but if it bears thorns and thistles, it is
rejected and near being cursed, whose end is to be burned.</p>
<h2

hope of overcoming this distressing state of readers and the danger that
threatens them</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">9</span> But, beloved, we are persuaded of
better things for you, and things that accompany salvation, even though
we speak like this. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> For God is not
unrighteous, so as to forget your work and the labor of love which you
showed toward his name, in that you served the saints, and still do
serve them. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> We desire that each one
of you may show the same diligence to the fullness of hope even to the
end, <span class="bibleverse">12</span> that you won’t be sluggish, but
imitators of those who through faith and perseverance inherited the
promises.</p>
<h2
id="the-firm-foundation-of-hope-in-the-glory-that-is-surely-to-be-expected-lies-in-the-trustworthy-promises-of-god">The
firm foundation of hope in the glory that is surely to be expected lies
in the trustworthy promises of God</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">13</span> For when God made a promise to
Abraham, since he could swear by no one greater, he swore by himself,
<span class="bibleverse">14</span> saying, “Surely blessing I will bless
you, and multiplying I will multiply you.”<a href="#fn23"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a>
<span class="bibleverse">15</span> Thus, having patiently endured, he
obtained the promise. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> For men indeed
swear by a greater one, and in every dispute of theirs the oath is final
for confirmation. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> In this way God,
being determined to show more abundantly to the heirs of the promise the
immutability of his counsel, interposed with an oath, <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> that by two immutable things, in which it
is impossible for God to lie, we may have a strong encouragement, who
have fled for refuge to take hold of the hope set before us. <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> This hope we have as an anchor of the soul,
a hope both sure and steadfast and entering into that which is within
the veil, <span class="bibleverse">20</span> where as a forerunner Jesus
entered for us, having become a high priest forever after the order of
Melchizedek.</p>
<h1 id="section-6">7</h1>
<h2
id="jesus-the-perfect-high-priest-forever-after-the-order-of-melchizedek">Jesus,
the perfect high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> For this Melchizedek, king of
Salem, priest of God Most High, who met Abraham returning from the
slaughter of the kings and blessed him, <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> to whom also Abraham divided a tenth part of
all (being first, by interpretation, “king of righteousness”, and then
also “king of Salem”, which means “king of peace”, <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> without father, without mother, without
genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made
like the Son of God), remains a priest continually.</p>
<h2
id="melchizedek-is-more-worthy-than-the-levitical-priests">Melchizedek
is more worthy than the Levitical priests</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">4</span> Now consider how great this man
was, to whom even Abraham the patriarch gave a tenth out of the best
plunder. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> They indeed of the sons of
Levi who receive the priest’s office have a commandment to take tithes
from the people according to the law, that is, of their brothers, though
these have come out of the body of Abraham, <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> but he whose genealogy is not counted from
them has accepted tithes from Abraham, and has blessed him who has the
promises. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> But without any dispute the
lesser is blessed by the greater. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> Here
people who die receive tithes, but there one receives tithes of whom it
is testified that he lives. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> We can say
that through Abraham even Levi, who receives tithes, has paid tithes,
<span class="bibleverse">10</span> for he was yet in the body of his
father when Melchizedek met him.</p>
<h2
id="the-change-and-abolition-of-the-priesthood-caused-by-the-peculiar-priesthood-of-jesus">The
change and abolition of the priesthood caused by the peculiar priesthood
of Jesus</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">11</span> Now if perfection was through the
Levitical priesthood (for under it the people have received the law),
what further need was there for another priest to arise after the order
of Melchizedek, and not be called after the order of Aaron? <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> For the priesthood being changed, there is
of necessity a change made also in the law. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> For he of whom these things are said
belongs to another tribe, from which no one has officiated at the altar.
<span class="bibleverse">14</span> For it is evident that our Lord has
sprung out of Judah, about which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning
priesthood. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> This is yet more
abundantly evident, if after the likeness of Melchizedek there arises
another priest, <span class="bibleverse">16</span> who has been made,
not after the law of a fleshly commandment, but after the power of an
endless life; <span class="bibleverse">17</span> for it is testified,
“You are a priest forever, according to the order of Melchizedek.”<a

<h2

reason for the change in the order of the priests is that Jesus should
be the guarantor of a higher covenant</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">18</span> For there is an annulling of a
foregoing commandment because of its weakness and uselessness <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> (for the law made nothing perfect), and a
bringing in of a better hope, through which we draw near to God. <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> Inasmuch as he was not made priest without
the taking of an oath <span class="bibleverse">21</span> (for they
indeed have been made priests without an oath), but he with an oath by
him that says of him, “The Lord swore and will not change his mind, ‘You
are a priest forever, according to the order of Melchizedek.’”<a
href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> <span class="bibleverse">22</span>
By so much, Jesus has become the guarantee of a better covenant. <span
class="bibleverse">23</span> Many, indeed, have been made priests,
because they are hindered from continuing by death. <span
class="bibleverse">24</span> But he, because he lives forever, has his
priesthood unchangeable. <span class="bibleverse">25</span> Therefore he
is also able to save to the uttermost those who draw near to God through
him, seeing that he lives forever to make intercession for them.</p>
<h2 id="jesus-as-the-perfect-and-eternal-high-priest">Jesus as the
perfect and eternal high priest</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">26</span> For such a high priest was fitting
for us: holy, guiltless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and made
higher than the heavens; <span class="bibleverse">27</span> who doesn’t
need, like those high priests, to offer up sacrifices daily, first for
his own sins, and then for the sins of the people. For he did this once
for all, when he offered up himself. <span class="bibleverse">28</span>
For the law appoints men as high priests who have weakness, but the word
of the oath, which came after the law, appoints a Son forever who has
been perfected.</p>

superiority of Jesus' heavenly high priestly ministry and the new
covenant of which he mediates</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Now in the things which we are
saying, the main point is this: we have such a high priest, who sat down
on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens, <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> a servant of the sanctuary and of the true
tabernacle which the Lord pitched, not man. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> For every high priest is appointed to offer
both gifts and sacrifices. Therefore it is necessary that this high
priest also have something to offer. <span class="bibleverse">4</span>
For if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, seeing there
are priests who offer the gifts according to the law, <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> who serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly
things, even as Moses was warned by God when he was about to make the
tabernacle, for he said, “See, you shall make everything according to

<span class="bibleverse">6</span> But now he has obtained a more
excellent ministry, by as much as he is also the mediator of a better
covenant, which on better promises has been given as law. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> For if that first covenant had been
faultless, then no place would have been sought for a second. <span

“Behold,<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"

Lord, “that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with
the house of Judah; <span class="bibleverse">9</span> not according to
the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them
by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; for they didn’t
continue in my covenant, and I disregarded them,” says the Lord. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> “For this is the covenant that I will make
with the house of Israel after those days,” says the Lord: “I will put
my laws into their mind; I will also write them on their heart. I will
be their God, and they will be my people. <span

citizen<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"

‘Know the Lord,’ for all will know me, from their least to their

their unrighteousness. I will remember their sins and lawless deeds no
more.”<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a> <span class="bibleverse">13</span>
In that he says, “A new covenant”, he has made the first obsolete. But
that which is becoming obsolete and grows aged is near to vanishing
away.</p>

imperfection of the Levitical priestly ministry and the perfection (or
superiority) of the high priestly ministry of Christ</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Now indeed even the first<a
href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a> covenant had ordinances of divine
service and an earthly sanctuary. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> For
a tabernacle was prepared. In the first part were the lamp stand, the
table, and the show bread, which is called the Holy Place. <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> After the second veil was the tabernacle
which is called the Holy of Holies, <span class="bibleverse">4</span>
having a golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant overlaid on
all sides with gold, in which was a golden pot holding the manna,
Aaron’s rod that budded, and the tablets of the covenant; <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> and above it cherubim of glory overshadowing
the mercy seat, of which things we can’t speak now in detail. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> Now these things having been thus prepared,
the priests go in continually into the first tabernacle, accomplishing
the services, <span class="bibleverse">7</span> but into the second the
high priest alone, once in the year, not without blood, which he offers
for himself and for the errors of the people. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> The Holy Spirit is indicating this, that the
way into the Holy Place wasn’t yet revealed while the first tabernacle
was still standing. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> This is a symbol
of the present age, where gifts and sacrifices are offered that are
incapable, concerning the conscience, of making the worshiper perfect,
<span class="bibleverse">10</span> being only (with foods and drinks and
various washings) fleshly ordinances, imposed until a time of
reformation. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> But Christ having come
as a high priest of the coming good things, through the greater and more
perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this
creation, <span class="bibleverse">12</span> nor yet through the blood
of goats and calves, but through his own blood, entered in once for all
into the Holy Place, having obtained eternal redemption. <span
class="bibleverse">13</span> For if the blood of goats and bulls, and
the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who have been defiled, sanctify
to the cleanness of the flesh, <span class="bibleverse">14</span> how
much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit
offered himself without defect to God, cleanse your conscience from dead
works to serve the living God?</p>

as mediator of a new covenant and his unique sacrificial death as the
eternal means of his heavenly service as high priest</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">15</span> For this reason he is the mediator
of a new covenant, since a death has occurred for the redemption of the
transgressions that were under the first covenant, that those who have
been called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance. <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> For where a last will and testament is,
there must of necessity be the death of him who made it. <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> For a will is in force where there has been
death, for it is never in force while he who made it lives. <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> Therefore even the first covenant has not
been dedicated without blood. <span class="bibleverse">19</span> For
when every commandment had been spoken by Moses to all the people
according to the law, he took the blood of the calves and the goats,
with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book
itself and all the people, <span class="bibleverse">20</span> saying,
“This is the blood of the covenant which God has commanded you.”<a
href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a> <span class="bibleverse">21</span>
He sprinkled the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry in the
same way with the blood. <span class="bibleverse">22</span> According to
the law, nearly everything is cleansed with blood, and apart from
shedding of blood there is no remission.</p>
<h2
id="the-unique-and-bloody-self-sacrifice-of-christ-and-its-tremendous-meaning-of-salvation-for-believers">The
unique and bloody self-sacrifice of Christ and its tremendous meaning of
salvation for believers</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">23</span> It was necessary therefore that
the copies of the things in the heavens should be cleansed with these,
but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.
<span class="bibleverse">24</span> For Christ hasn’t entered into holy
places made with hands, which are representations of the true, but into
heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us; <span
class="bibleverse">25</span> nor yet that he should offer himself often,
as the high priest enters into the holy place year by year with blood
not his own, <span class="bibleverse">26</span> or else he must have
suffered often since the foundation of the world. But now once at the
end of the ages, he has been revealed to put away sin by the sacrifice
of himself. <span class="bibleverse">27</span> Inasmuch as it is
appointed for men to die once, and after this, judgment, <span
class="bibleverse">28</span> so Christ also, having been offered once to
bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, not to deal with sin,
but to save those who are eagerly waiting for him.</p>

bleak example and inadequacy of the Levitical high priest's annual
sacrifice of reconciliation; the perfection of Jesus' sacrifice</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> For the law, having a shadow of the
good to come, not the very image of the things, can never with the same
sacrifices year by year, which they offer continually, make perfect
those who draw near. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> Or else wouldn’t
they have ceased to be offered, because the worshipers, having been once
cleansed, would have had no more consciousness of sins? <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> But in those sacrifices there is a yearly
reminder of sins. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> For it is impossible
that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins. <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> Therefore when he comes into the world, he
says, “You didn’t desire sacrifice and offering, but you prepared a body
for me. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> You had no pleasure in whole
burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> Then I said, ‘Behold, I have come (in the
scroll of the book it is written of me) to do your will, O God.’”<a
href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a> <span class="bibleverse">8</span>
Previously saying, “Sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings
and sacrifices for sin you didn’t desire, neither had pleasure in them”
(those which are offered according to the law), <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> then he has said, “Behold, I have come to do
your will.” He takes away the first, that he may establish the second,
<span class="bibleverse">10</span> by which will we have been sanctified
through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.</p>

sin unnecessary because it made believers completely perfect before
God</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">11</span> Every priest indeed stands day by
day serving and offering often the same sacrifices, which can never take
away sins, <span class="bibleverse">12</span> but he, when he had
offered one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down on the right hand of
God, <span class="bibleverse">13</span> from that time waiting until his
enemies are made the footstool of his feet. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> For by one offering he has perfected
forever those who are being sanctified. <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> The Holy Spirit also testifies to us, for
after saying, <span class="bibleverse">16</span> “This is the covenant
that I will make with them after those days,” says the Lord, “I will put
my laws on their heart, I will also write them on their mind;”<a
href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"

iniquities no more.”<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"

<p><span class="bibleverse">32</span> But remember the former days, in
which, after you were enlightened, you endured a great struggle with
sufferings: <span class="bibleverse">33</span> partly, being exposed to
both reproaches and oppressions, and partly, becoming partakers with
those who were treated so. <span class="bibleverse">34</span> For you
both had compassion on me in my chains and joyfully accepted the
plundering of your possessions, knowing that you have for yourselves a
better possession and an enduring one in the heavens. <span
class="bibleverse">35</span> Therefore don’t throw away your boldness,
which has a great reward. <span class="bibleverse">36</span> For you

excellent sacrifice than Cain, through which he had testimony given to
him that he was righteous, God testifying with respect to his gifts; and
through it he, being dead, still speaks. <span
class="bibleverse">5</span> By faith Enoch was taken away, so that he
wouldn’t see death, and he was not found, because God translated him.
For he has had testimony given to him that before his translation he had
been well pleasing to God. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> Without
faith it is impossible to be well pleasing to him, for he who comes to
God must believe that he exists, and that he is a rewarder of those who
seek him. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> By faith Noah, being warned
about things not yet seen, moved with godly fear,<a href="#fn38"

called, obeyed to go out to the place which he was to receive for an
inheritance. He went out, not knowing where he went. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> By faith he lived as an alien in the land of
promise, as in a land not his own, dwelling in tents with Isaac and
Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> For he was looking for the city which has
foundations, whose builder and maker is God. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> By faith even Sarah herself received power
to conceive, and she bore a child when she was past age, since she
counted him faithful who had promised. <span
class="bibleverse">12</span> Therefore as many as the stars of the sky
in multitude, and as innumerable as the sand which is by the sea shore,
were fathered by one man, and him as good as dead. <span

received the promises, but having seen<a href="#fn39"

them and embraced them from afar, and having confessed that they were
strangers and pilgrims on the earth. <span class="bibleverse">14</span>
For those who say such things make it clear that they are seeking a
country of their own. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> If indeed they
had been thinking of that country from which they went out, they would
have had enough time to return. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> But
now they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God
is not ashamed of them, to be called their God, for he has prepared a
city for them. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> By faith, Abraham,
being tested, offered up Isaac. Yes, he who had gladly received the
promises was offering up his only born<a href="#fn40"

son, <span class="bibleverse">18</span> to whom it was said, “Your

<span class="bibleverse">19</span> concluding that God is able to raise
up even from the dead. Figuratively speaking, he also did receive him
back from the dead. <span class="bibleverse">20</span> By faith Isaac
blessed Jacob and Esau, even concerning things to come. <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed
each of the sons of Joseph, and worshiped, leaning on the top of his
staff. <span class="bibleverse">22</span> By faith Joseph, when his end

riches than the treasures of Egypt; for he looked to the reward. <span

wrath of the king; for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible. <span

sprinkling of the blood, that the destroyer of the firstborn should not
touch them. <span class="bibleverse">29</span> By faith they passed

Moses said, “I am terrified and trembling.”<a href="#fn53"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53" role="doc-noteref"><sup>53</sup></a>
<span class="bibleverse">22</span> But you have come to Mount Zion and
to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to
innumerable multitudes of angels, <span class="bibleverse">23</span> to
the festal gathering and assembly of the firstborn who are enrolled in
heaven, to God the Judge of all, to the spirits of just men made
perfect, <span class="bibleverse">24</span> to Jesus, the mediator of a
new covenant,<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"

speaks better than that of Abel.</p>
<h2

glory of the end times, terrifying for the reluctant and blissful for
the obedient</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">25</span> See that you don’t refuse him who
speaks. For if they didn’t escape when they refused him who warned on
the earth, how much more will we not escape who turn away from him who
warns from heaven, <span class="bibleverse">26</span> whose voice shook
the earth then, but now he has promised, saying, “Yet once more I will
shake not only the earth, but also the heavens.”<a href="#fn55"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55" role="doc-noteref"><sup>55</sup></a>
<span class="bibleverse">27</span> This phrase, “Yet once more”
signifies the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things
that have been made, that those things which are not shaken may remain.
<span class="bibleverse">28</span> Therefore, receiving a Kingdom that
can’t be shaken, let’s have grace, through which we serve God
acceptably, with reverence and awe, <span class="bibleverse">29</span>
for our God is a consuming fire.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref"

warnings for fraternal love, moral purity and the promotion of community
life</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Let brotherly love continue. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> Don’t forget to show hospitality to
strangers, for in doing so, some have entertained angels without knowing
it. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> Remember those who are in bonds,
as bound with them, and those who are ill-treated, since you are also in
the body. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> Let marriage be held in
honor among all, and let the bed be undefiled; but God will judge the
sexually immoral and adulterers. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> Be
free from the love of money, content with such things as you have, for
he has said, “I will in no way leave you, neither will I in any way
forsake you.”<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"

admonition to be faithful to the rulers and to Jesus, the one who
remains in eternity and the end of the service of the sacrifice for
Jewish sin</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">7</span> Remember your leaders, men who
spoke to you the word of God, and considering the results of their
conduct, imitate their faith. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> Jesus
Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> Don’t be carried away by various and strange
teachings, for it is good that the heart be established by grace, not by
foods, through which those who were so occupied were not benefited.
<span class="bibleverse">10</span> We have an altar from which those who
serve the holy tabernacle have no right to eat. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> For the bodies of those animals, whose
blood is brought into the holy place by the high priest as an offering
for sin, are burned outside of the camp.<a href="#fn59"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59" role="doc-noteref"><sup>59</sup></a>
<span class="bibleverse">12</span> Therefore Jesus also, that he might
sanctify the people through his own blood, suffered outside of the gate.
<span class="bibleverse">13</span> Let’s therefore go out to him outside
of the camp, bearing his reproach. <span class="bibleverse">14</span>
For we don’t have here an enduring city, but we seek that which is to
come. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> Through him, then, let’s offer
up a sacrifice of praise to God <a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref60" role="doc-noteref"><sup>60</sup></a> continually, that is,
the fruit of lips which proclaim allegiance to his name.</p>
<h2
id="repeated-individual-warnings-especially-regarding-behavior-against-community-leaders">Repeated
individual warnings, especially regarding behavior against community
leaders</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">16</span> But don’t forget to be doing good
and sharing, for with such sacrifices God is well pleased. <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> Obey your leaders and submit to them, for
they watch on behalf of your souls, as those who will give account, that
they may do this with joy and not with groaning, for that would be
unprofitable for you. <span class="bibleverse">18</span> Pray for us,
for we are persuaded that we have a good conscience, desiring to live
honorably in all things. <span class="bibleverse">19</span> I strongly
urge you to do this, that I may be restored to you sooner.</p>
<h2
id="closing-of-the-letter-blessing-personal-messages-greetings">Closing
of the letter, blessing, personal messages, greetings</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">20</span> Now may the God of peace, who
brought again from the dead the great shepherd of the sheep with the
blood of an eternal covenant, our Lord Jesus, <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> make you complete in every good work to do
his will, working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight,
through Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen. <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> But I exhort you, brothers, endure the word
of exhortation, for I have written to you in few words. <span
class="bibleverse">23</span> Know that our brother Timothy has been
freed, with whom, if he comes shortly, I will see you. <span
class="bibleverse">24</span> Greet all of your leaders and all the
saints. The Italians greet you. <span class="bibleverse">25</span> Grace
be with you all. Amen.</p>
