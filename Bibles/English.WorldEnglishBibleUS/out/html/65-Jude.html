<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Jude,<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> a
servant of Jesus Christ,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> and brother of James, to those who
are called, sanctified by God the Father, and kept for Jesus Christ:
<span class="bibleverse">2</span> May mercy, peace, and love be
multiplied to you.</p>
<h2 id="the-need-to-fight-vicious-false-teachers">The need to fight
vicious false teachers</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">3</span> Beloved, while I was very eager to
write to you about our common salvation, I was constrained to write to
you exhorting you to contend earnestly for the faith which was once for
all delivered to the saints. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> For there
are certain men who crept in secretly, even those who were long ago
written about for this condemnation: ungodly men, turning the grace of
our God into indecency, and denying our only Master, God, and Lord,
Jesus Christ.</p>
<h2
id="description-of-vicious-seducers-and-threatening-criminal-court">Description
of vicious seducers and threatening criminal court</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">5</span> Now I desire to remind you, though
you already know this, that the Lord, having saved a people out of the
land of Egypt, afterward destroyed those who didn’t believe. <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> Angels who didn’t keep their first domain,
but deserted their own dwelling place, he has kept in everlasting bonds
under darkness for the judgment of the great day. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> Even as Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities
around them, having in the same way as these given themselves over to
sexual immorality and gone after strange flesh, are shown as an example,
suffering the punishment of eternal fire.</p>
<h2
id="description-of-the-arrogance-and-depravity-of-these-evildoers">Description
of the arrogance and depravity of these evildoers</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">8</span> Yet in the same way, these also in
their dreaming defile the flesh, despise authority, and slander
celestial beings. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> But Michael, the
archangel, when contending with the devil and arguing about the body of
Moses, dared not bring against him an abusive condemnation, but said,
“May the Lord rebuke you!” <span class="bibleverse">10</span> But these
speak evil of whatever things they don’t know. They are destroyed in
these things that they understand naturally, like the creatures without
reason. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> Woe to them! For they went in
the way of Cain, and ran riotously in the error of Balaam for hire, and
perished in Korah’s rebellion. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> These
are hidden rocky reefs in your love feasts when they feast with you,
shepherds who without fear feed themselves; clouds without water,
carried along by winds; autumn trees without fruit, twice dead, plucked
up by the roots; <span class="bibleverse">13</span> wild waves of the
sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, for whom the
blackness of darkness has been reserved forever. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> About these also Enoch, the seventh from
Adam, prophesied, saying, “Behold,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> the Lord came with ten
thousands of his holy ones, <span class="bibleverse">15</span> to
execute judgment on all, and to convict all the ungodly of all their
works of ungodliness which they have done in an ungodly way, and of all
the hard things which ungodly sinners have spoken against him.” <span
class="bibleverse">16</span> These are murmurers and complainers,
walking after their lusts—and their mouth speaks proud things—showing
respect of persons to gain advantage.</p>
<h2
id="reference-to-the-apostolic-proclamation-final-warnings-especially-regarding-the-treatment-of-the-seduced-praise-god-like-the-end-of-a-letter">Reference
to the apostolic proclamation; Final warnings, especially regarding the
treatment of the seduced; Praise God like the end of a letter</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">17</span> But you, beloved, remember the
words which have been spoken before by the apostles of our Lord Jesus
Christ. <span class="bibleverse">18</span> They said to you, “In the
last time there will be mockers, walking after their own ungodly lusts.”
<span class="bibleverse">19</span> These are those who cause divisions
and are sensual, not having the Spirit. <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> But you, beloved, keep building up
yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit. <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> Keep yourselves in God’s love, looking for
the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to eternal life. <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> On some have compassion, making a
distinction, <span class="bibleverse">23</span> and some save, snatching
them out of the fire with fear, hating even the clothing stained by the
flesh. <span class="bibleverse">24</span> Now to him who is able to keep
them<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> from stumbling, and to present you
faultless before the presence of his glory in great joy, <span
class="bibleverse">25</span> to God our Savior, who alone is wise, be
glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and forever. Amen.</p>
