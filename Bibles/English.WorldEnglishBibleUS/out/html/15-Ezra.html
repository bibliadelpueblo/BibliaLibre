<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Now in the first year of Cyrus king
of Persia, that Yahweh’s<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"

accomplished, Yahweh stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, so
that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also
in writing, saying, <span class="bibleverse">2</span> “Cyrus king of
Persia says, ‘Yahweh, the God<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"

all the kingdoms of the earth; and he has commanded me to build him a
house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. <span class="bibleverse">3</span>
Whoever there is among you of all his people, may his God be with him,
and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house
of Yahweh, the God of Israel (he is God), which is in Jerusalem. <span
class="bibleverse">4</span> Whoever is left, in any place where he
lives, let the men of his place help him with silver, with gold, with
goods, and with animals, in addition to the free will offering for God’s

<p><span class="bibleverse">5</span> Then the heads of fathers’

spirit God had stirred to go up, rose up to build Yahweh’s house which
is in Jerusalem. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> All those who were
around them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver, with gold,
with goods, with animals, and with precious things, in addition to all
that was willingly offered.</p>

Jerusalem, and had put in the house of his gods; <span

by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, and counted them out to
Sheshbazzar the prince of Judah. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> This
is the number of them: thirty platters of gold, one thousand platters of
silver, twenty-nine knives, <span class="bibleverse">10</span> thirty
bowls of gold, four hundred ten silver bowls of a second kind, and one
thousand other vessels. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> All the

<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> When the seventh month had come,
and the children of Israel were in the cities, the people gathered
themselves together as one man to Jerusalem. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> Then Jeshua the son of Jozadak stood up with
his brothers the priests and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and his
relatives, and built the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt
offerings on it, as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God.
<span class="bibleverse">3</span> In spite of their fear because of the
peoples of the surrounding lands, they set the altar on its base; and
they offered burnt offerings on it to Yahweh, even burnt offerings
morning and evening. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> They kept the
feast of booths, as it is written, and offered the daily burnt offerings
by number, according to the ordinance, as the duty of every day
required; <span class="bibleverse">5</span> and afterward the continual
burnt offering, the offerings of the new moons, of all the set feasts of
Yahweh that were consecrated, and of everyone who willingly offered a
free will offering to Yahweh. <span class="bibleverse">6</span> From the
first day of the seventh month, they began to offer burnt offerings to
Yahweh; but the foundation of Yahweh’s temple was not yet laid.</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">7</span> They also gave money to the masons
and to the carpenters. They also gave food, drink, and oil to the people
of Sidon and Tyre to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea, to
Joppa, according to the grant that they had from Cyrus King of Persia.
<span class="bibleverse">8</span> Now in the second year of their coming
to God’s house at Jerusalem, in the second month, Zerubbabel the son of
Shealtiel, Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the rest of their brothers the
priests and the Levites, and all those who had come out of the captivity
to Jerusalem, began the work and appointed the Levites, from twenty
years old and upward, to have the oversight of the work of Yahweh’s
house. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> Then Jeshua stood with his sons
and his brothers, Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, together to
have the oversight of the workmen in God’s house: the sons of Henadad,
with their sons and their brothers the Levites. <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> When the builders laid the foundation of
Yahweh’s temple, they set the priests in their vestments with trumpets,
with the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise Yahweh,
according to the directions of David king of Israel. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> They sang to one another in praising and
giving thanks to Yahweh, “For he is good, for his loving kindness
endures forever toward Israel.” All the people shouted with a great
shout, when they praised Yahweh, because the foundation of Yahweh’s
house had been laid. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> But many of the
priests and Levites and heads of fathers’ households, the old men who
had seen the first house, when the foundation of this house was laid
before their eyes, wept with a loud voice. Many also shouted aloud for
joy, <span class="bibleverse">13</span> so that the people could not
discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of
the people; for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was
heard far away.</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Now when the adversaries of Judah
and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity were building a
temple to Yahweh, the God of Israel, <span class="bibleverse">2</span>
they came near to Zerubbabel, and to the heads of fathers’ households,
and said to them, “Let us build with you, for we seek your God as you
do; and we have been sacrificing to him since the days of Esar Haddon
king of Assyria, who brought us up here.” <span
class="bibleverse">3</span> But Zerubbabel, Jeshua, and the rest of the
heads of fathers’ households of Israel said to them, “You have nothing
to do with us in building a house to our God; but we ourselves together
will build to Yahweh, the God of Israel, as King Cyrus the king of
Persia has commanded us.” <span class="bibleverse">4</span> Then the
people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and
troubled them in building. <span class="bibleverse">5</span> They hired
counselors against them to frustrate their purpose all the days of Cyrus
king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia.</p>

of Judah and Jerusalem. <span class="bibleverse">7</span> In the days of
Artaxerxes, Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of his companions
wrote to Artaxerxes king of Persia; and the writing of the letter was
written in Syrian and delivered in the Syrian language. <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe
wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king as follows.

Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the Archevites, the
Babylonians, the Shushanchites, the Dehaites, the Elamites, <span
class="bibleverse">10</span> and the rest of the nations whom the great
and noble Osnappar brought over and settled in the city of Samaria, and
in the rest of the country beyond the River, and so forth, wrote. <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> This is the copy of the letter that they
sent: To King Artaxerxes, from your servants, the people beyond the
River. i1 <span class="bibleverse">12</span> Be it known to the king
that the Jews who came up from you have come to us to Jerusalem. They
are building the rebellious and bad city, and have finished the walls
and repaired the foundations. <span class="bibleverse">13</span> Be it
known now to the king that if this city is built and the walls finished,
they will not pay tribute, custom, or toll, and in the end it will be
hurtful to the kings. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> Now because we
eat the salt of the palace and it is not appropriate for us to see the
king’s dishonor, therefore we have sent and informed the king, <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> that search may be made in the book of the
records of your fathers. You will see in the book of the records, and
know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful to kings and
provinces, and that they have started rebellions within it in the past.
That is why this city was destroyed. <span class="bibleverse">16</span>
We inform the king that if this city is built and the walls finished,
then you will have no possession beyond the River.</p>

Rehum the chancellor, and to Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of
their companions who live in Samaria, and in the rest of the country
beyond the River: Peace. i1 <span class="bibleverse">18</span> The
letter which you sent to us has been plainly read before me. <span
class="bibleverse">19</span> I decreed, and search has been made, and it
was found that this city has made insurrection against kings in the
past, and that rebellion and revolts have been made in it. <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> There have also been mighty kings over
Jerusalem who have ruled over all the country beyond the River; and
tribute, custom, and toll was paid to them. <span
class="bibleverse">21</span> Make a decree now to cause these men to
cease, and that this city not be built until a decree is made by me.
<span class="bibleverse">22</span> Be careful that you not be slack
doing so. Why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings? <span
class="bibleverse">23</span> Then when the copy of King Artaxerxes’
letter was read before Rehum, Shimshai the scribe, and their companions,
they went in haste to Jerusalem to the Jews, and made them to cease by
force of arms. <span class="bibleverse">24</span> Then work stopped on

Tattenai, the governor beyond the River, came to them, with

thus, “Who gave you a decree to build this house, and to finish this
wall?” <span class="bibleverse">10</span> We asked them their names

answer, saying, “We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth and
are building the house that was built these many years ago, which a
great king of Israel built and finished. <span

of heaven to wrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of
Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house and carried the people
away into Babylon. <span class="bibleverse">13</span> But in the first

this house of God. <span class="bibleverse">14</span> The gold and

those Cyrus the king also took out of the temple of Babylon, and they

governor. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> He said to him, ‘Take these
vessels, go, put them in the temple that is in Jerusalem, and let God’s
house be built in its place.’ <span class="bibleverse">16</span> Then
the same Sheshbazzar came and laid the foundations of God’s house which
is in Jerusalem. Since that time even until now it has been being built,
and yet it is not completed. i1 <span class="bibleverse">17</span> Now
therefore, if it seems good to the king, let a search be made in the

<h2 id="completion-and-solemn-dedication-of-the-temple">Completion and
solemn dedication of the temple</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">13</span> Then Tattenai, the governor beyond
the River, Shetharbozenai, and their companions did accordingly with all
diligence, because Darius the king had sent a decree. <span
class="bibleverse">14</span> The elders of the Jews built and prospered,
through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of
Iddo. They built and finished it, according to the commandment of the
God of Israel, and according to the decree of Cyrus, Darius, and
Artaxerxes king of Persia. <span class="bibleverse">15</span> This house
was finished on the third day of the month Adar, which was in the sixth
year of the reign of Darius the king. <span class="bibleverse">16</span>
The children of Israel, the priests, the Levites, and the rest of the
children of the captivity, kept the dedication of this house of God with
joy. <span class="bibleverse">17</span> They offered at the dedication
of this house of God one hundred bulls, two hundred rams, four hundred
lambs; and for a sin offering for all Israel, twelve male goats,
according to the number of the tribes of Israel. <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> They set the priests in their divisions and
the Levites in their courses, for the service of God which is at
Jerusalem, as it is written in the book of Moses.</p>
<h2 id="easter-celebration">Easter Celebration</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">19</span> The children of the captivity kept
the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month. <span
class="bibleverse">20</span> Because the priests and the Levites had
purified themselves together, all of them were pure. They killed the
Passover for all the children of the captivity, for their brothers the
priests, and for themselves. <span class="bibleverse">21</span> The
children of Israel who had returned out of the captivity, and all who
had separated themselves to them from the filthiness of the nations of
the land to seek Yahweh, the God of Israel, ate, <span
class="bibleverse">22</span> and kept the feast of unleavened bread
seven days with joy; because Yahweh had made them joyful, and had turned
the heart of the king of Assyria to them, to strengthen their hands in
the work of God, the God of Israel’s house.</p>

up from Babylon. He was a skilled scribe in the law of Moses, which
Yahweh, the God of Israel, had given; and the king granted him all his
request, according to Yahweh his God’s hand on him. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> Some of the children of Israel, including
some of the priests, the Levites, the singers, the gatekeepers, and the
temple servants went up to Jerusalem in the seventh year of Artaxerxes
the king. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> He came to Jerusalem in the
fifth month, which was in the seventh year of the king. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> For on the first day of the first month he
began to go up from Babylon; and on the first day of the fifth month he
came to Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God on him. <span

Israel: <span class="bibleverse">12</span> Artaxerxes, king of kings, To
Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the perfect God of heaven. i1
Now <span class="bibleverse">13</span> I make a decree that all those of
the people of Israel and their priests and the Levites in my realm, who
intend of their own free will to go to Jerusalem, go with you. <span

seven counselors to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem, according to
the law of your God which is in your hand, <span

king and his counselors have freely offered to the God of Israel, whose
habitation is in Jerusalem, <span class="bibleverse">16</span> and all
the silver and gold that you will find in all the province of Babylon,
with the free will offering of the people and of the priests, offering
willingly for the house of their God which is in Jerusalem. <span

with this money bulls, rams, and lambs with their meal offerings and

Whatever seems good to you and to your brothers to do with the rest of
the silver and the gold, do that according to the will of your God.
<span class="bibleverse">19</span> The vessels that are given to you for
the service of the house of your God, deliver before the God of

give it out of the king’s treasure house. i1 <span

let it be done exactly for the house of the God of heaven; for why
should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons? i1

the law of the king, let judgment be executed on him with all diligence,

<h2 id="final-preparations-for-departure">Final preparations for

<p><span class="bibleverse">15</span> I gathered them together to the
river that runs to Ahava; and there we encamped three days. Then I
looked around at the people and the priests, and found there were none
of the sons of Levi. <span class="bibleverse">16</span> Then I sent for
Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, for Elnathan, for Jarib, for Elnathan,
for Nathan, for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, chief men; also for
Joiarib and for Elnathan, who were teachers. <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> I sent them out to Iddo the chief at the
place Casiphia; and I told them what they should tell Iddo and his
brothers the temple servants at the place Casiphia, that they should
bring to us ministers for the house of our God. <span
class="bibleverse">18</span> According to the good hand of our God on us
they brought us a man of discretion, of the sons of Mahli, the son of
Levi, the son of Israel, namely Sherebiah, with his sons and his
brothers, eighteen; <span class="bibleverse">19</span> and Hashabiah,
and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, his brothers and their
sons, twenty; <span class="bibleverse">20</span> and of the temple
servants, whom David and the princes had given for the service of the
Levites, two hundred twenty temple servants. All of them were mentioned
by name.</p>
<h2

and prayer of those returning home; Giving of temple gifts to

<p><span class="bibleverse">21</span> Then I proclaimed a fast there at
the river Ahava, that we might humble ourselves before our God, to seek
from him a straight way for us, for our little ones, and for all our
possessions. <span class="bibleverse">22</span> For I was ashamed to ask
of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy
on the way, because we had spoken to the king, saying, “The hand of our
God is on all those who seek him, for good; but his power and his wrath
is against all those who forsake him.” <span
class="bibleverse">23</span> So we fasted and begged our God for this,
and he granted our request. <span class="bibleverse">24</span> Then I
set apart twelve of the chiefs of the priests, even Sherebiah,
Hashabiah, and ten of their brothers with them, <span
class="bibleverse">25</span> and weighed to them the silver, the gold,
and the vessels, even the offering for the house of our God, which the
king, his counselors, his princes, and all Israel there present, had
offered. <span class="bibleverse">26</span> I weighed into their hand
six hundred fifty talents of silver,<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> one hundred talents of
silver vessels, one hundred talents of gold, <span
class="bibleverse">27</span> twenty bowls of gold weighing one thousand
darics,<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> and two vessels of fine bright
bronze, precious as gold. <span class="bibleverse">28</span> I said to
them, “You are holy to Yahweh, and the vessels are holy. The silver and
the gold are a free will offering to Yahweh, the God of your fathers.
<span class="bibleverse">29</span> Watch and keep them until you weigh
them before the chiefs of the priests, the Levites, and the princes of
the fathers’ households of Israel at Jerusalem, in the rooms of Yahweh’s
house.” <span class="bibleverse">30</span> So the priests and the
Levites received the weight of the silver, the gold, and the vessels, to
bring them to Jerusalem to the house of our God.</p>

<p><span class="bibleverse">31</span> Then we departed from the river
Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month, to go to Jerusalem. The
hand of our God was on us, and he delivered us from the hand of the
enemy and the bandits by the way. <span class="bibleverse">32</span> We
came to Jerusalem, and stayed there three days. <span
class="bibleverse">33</span> On the fourth day the silver and the gold
and the vessels were weighed in the house of our God into the hand of
Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest; and with him was Eleazar the son
of Phinehas; and with them were Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah
the son of Binnui, the Levites. <span class="bibleverse">34</span>
Everything was counted and weighed; and all the weight was written at
that time. <span class="bibleverse">35</span> The children of the
captivity, who had come out of exile, offered burnt offerings to the God
of Israel: twelve bulls for all Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven
lambs, and twelve male goats for a sin offering. All this was a burnt
offering to Yahweh. <span class="bibleverse">36</span> They delivered
the king’s commissions to the king’s local governors and to the
governors beyond the River. So they supported the people and God’s
house.</p>

<h2 id="esra-notices-mixed-marriages-his-dismay-at-these-officials">Esra

<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Now when these things were done,
the princes came near to me, saying, “The people of Israel, the priests,
and the Levites have not separated themselves from the peoples of the
lands, following their abominations, even those of the Canaanites, the
Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites,
the Egyptians, and the Amorites. <span class="bibleverse">2</span> For
they have taken of their daughters for themselves and for their sons, so
that the holy offspring have mixed themselves with the peoples of the
lands. Yes, the hand of the princes and rulers has been chief in this
trespass.” <span class="bibleverse">3</span> When I heard this thing, I
tore my garment and my robe, and pulled the hair out of my head and of
my beard, and sat down confounded. <span class="bibleverse">4</span>
Then everyone who trembled at the words of the God of Israel were
assembled to me because of the trespass of the exiles; and I sat
confounded until the evening offering.</p>
<h2 id="ezras-penitential-prayer">Ezra's penitential prayer</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">5</span> At the evening offering I rose up
from my humiliation, even with my garment and my robe torn; and I fell
on my knees, and spread out my hands to Yahweh my God; <span
class="bibleverse">6</span> and I said, “My God, I am ashamed and blush
to lift up my face to you, my God, for our iniquities have increased
over our head, and our guiltiness has grown up to the heavens. <span
class="bibleverse">7</span> Since the days of our fathers we have been
exceedingly guilty to this day; and for our iniquities we, our kings,
and our priests have been delivered into the hand of the kings of the
lands, to the sword, to captivity, to plunder, and to confusion of face,
as it is this day. <span class="bibleverse">8</span> Now for a little
moment grace has been shown from Yahweh our God, to leave us a remnant
to escape, and to give us a stake in his holy place, that our God may
lighten our eyes, and revive us a little in our bondage. <span
class="bibleverse">9</span> For we are bondservants; yet our God has not
forsaken us in our bondage, but has extended loving kindness to us in
the sight of the kings of Persia, to revive us, to set up the house of
our God, and to repair its ruins, and to give us a wall in Judah and in
Jerusalem. <span class="bibleverse">10</span> “Now, our God, what shall
we say after this? For we have forsaken your commandments, <span
class="bibleverse">11</span> which you have commanded by your servants
the prophets, saying, ‘The land to which you go to possess is an unclean
land through the uncleanness of the peoples of the lands, through their
abominations, which have filled it from one end to another with their
filthiness. <span class="bibleverse">12</span> Now therefore don’t give
your daughters to their sons. Don’t take their daughters to your sons,
nor seek their peace or their prosperity forever, that you may be strong
and eat the good of the land, and leave it for an inheritance to your
children forever.’ <span class="bibleverse">13</span> “After all that
has come on us for our evil deeds and for our great guilt, since you,
our God, have punished us less than our iniquities deserve, and have
given us such a remnant, <span class="bibleverse">14</span> shall we
again break your commandments, and join ourselves with the peoples that
do these abominations? Wouldn’t you be angry with us until you had
consumed us, so that there would be no remnant, nor any to escape? <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> Yahweh, the God of Israel, you are
righteous; for we are left a remnant that has escaped, as it is today.
Behold,<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> we are before you in our
guiltiness; for no one can stand before you because of this.”</p>
<h1 id="section-9">10</h1>
<h2 id="the-action-against-mixed-marriages">The action against mixed
marriages</h2>
<p><span class="bibleverse">1</span> Now while Ezra prayed and made
confession, weeping and casting himself down before God’s house, there
was gathered together to him out of Israel a very great assembly of men
and women and children; for the people wept very bitterly. <span
class="bibleverse">2</span> Shecaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons
of Elam, answered Ezra, “We have trespassed against our God, and have
married foreign women of the peoples of the land. Yet now there is hope
for Israel concerning this thing. <span class="bibleverse">3</span> Now
therefore let’s make a covenant with our God to put away all the wives
and those who are born of them, according to the counsel of my lord and
of those who tremble at the commandment of our God. Let it be done
according to the law. <span class="bibleverse">4</span> Arise, for the
matter belongs to you and we are with you. Be courageous, and do it.”
<span class="bibleverse">5</span> Then Ezra arose, and made the chiefs
of the priests, the Levites, and all Israel to swear that they would do
according to this word. So they swore. <span class="bibleverse">6</span>
Then Ezra rose up from before God’s house, and went into the room of
Jehohanan the son of Eliashib. When he came there, he didn’t eat bread
or drank water, for he mourned because of the trespass of the exiles.
<span class="bibleverse">7</span> They made a proclamation throughout
Judah and Jerusalem to all the children of the captivity, that they
should gather themselves together to Jerusalem; <span
class="bibleverse">8</span> and that whoever didn’t come within three
days, according to the counsel of the princes and the elders, all his
possessions should be forfeited, and he himself separated from the
assembly of the captivity. <span class="bibleverse">9</span> Then all
the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves together to Jerusalem
within the three days. It was the ninth month, on the twentieth day of
the month; and all the people sat in the wide place in front of God’s
house, trembling because of this matter, and because of the great rain.
<span class="bibleverse">10</span> Ezra the priest stood up and said to
them, “You have trespassed, and have married foreign women, increasing
the guilt of Israel. <span class="bibleverse">11</span> Now therefore
make confession to Yahweh, the God of your fathers and do his pleasure.
Separate yourselves from the peoples of the land and from the foreign
women.” <span class="bibleverse">12</span> Then all the assembly
answered with a loud voice, “We must do as you have said concerning us.
<span class="bibleverse">13</span> But the people are many, and it is a
time of much rain, and we are not able to stand outside. This is not a
work of one day or two, for we have greatly transgressed in this matter.
<span class="bibleverse">14</span> Now let our princes be appointed for
all the assembly, and let all those who are in our cities who have
married foreign women come at appointed times, and with them the elders
of every city and its judges, until the fierce wrath of our God is
turned from us, until this matter is resolved.” <span
class="bibleverse">15</span> Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and
Jahzeiah the son of Tikvah stood up against this; and Meshullam and
Shabbethai the Levite helped them. <span class="bibleverse">16</span>
The children of the captivity did so. Ezra the priest, with certain
heads of fathers’ households, after their fathers’ houses, and all of
them by their names, were set apart; and they sat down in the first day
of the tenth month to examine the matter. <span
class="bibleverse">17</span> They finished with all the men who had
married foreign women by the first day of the first month.</p>
