\bibverse{1} Paul, a prisoner of Christ+ 1:1 “Christ” means “Anointed One”. Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon, our beloved fellow worker, \bibverse{2} to the beloved Apphia, to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the assembly in your house: \bibverse{3} Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 

\bibverse{4} I thank my God always, making mention of you in my prayers, \bibverse{5} hearing of your love and of the faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and toward all the saints, \bibverse{6} that the fellowship of your faith may become effective in the knowledge of every good thing which is in us in Christ Jesus. \bibverse{7} For we have much joy and comfort in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother. 

\bibverse{8} Therefore though I have all boldness in Christ to command you that which is appropriate, \bibverse{9} yet for love’s sake I rather appeal to you, being such a one as Paul, the aged, but also a prisoner of Jesus Christ. \bibverse{10} I appeal to you for my child Onesimus, whom I have become the father of in my chains,+ 1:10 Onesimus means “useful”. \bibverse{11} who once was useless to you, but now is useful to you and to me. \bibverse{12} I am sending him back. Therefore receive him, that is, my own heart, \bibverse{13} whom I desired to keep with me, that on your behalf he might serve me in my chains for the Good News. \bibverse{14} But I was willing to do nothing without your consent, that your goodness would not be as of necessity, but of free will. \bibverse{15} For perhaps he was therefore separated from you for a while that you would have him forever, \bibverse{16} no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, a beloved brother—especially to me, but how much rather to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord. 

\bibverse{17} If then you count me a partner, receive him as you would receive me. \bibverse{18} But if he has wronged you at all or owes you anything, put that to my account. \bibverse{19} I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will repay it (not to mention to you that you owe to me even your own self besides). \bibverse{20} Yes, brother, let me have joy from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in the Lord. 

\bibverse{21} Having confidence in your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even beyond what I say. 

\bibverse{22} Also, prepare a guest room for me, for I hope that through your prayers I will be restored to you. 

\bibverse{23} Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you, \bibverse{24} as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers. 

\bibverse{25} The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
