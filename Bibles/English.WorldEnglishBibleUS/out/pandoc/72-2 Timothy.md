\bibverse{1} Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ+ 1:1 “Christ” means “Anointed One”. through the will of God, according to the promise of the life which is in Christ Jesus, \bibverse{2} to Timothy, my beloved child: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. 

\bibverse{3} I thank God, whom I serve as my forefathers did, with a pure conscience. How unceasing is my memory of you in my petitions, night and day \bibverse{4} longing to see you, remembering your tears, that I may be filled with joy; \bibverse{5} having been reminded of the sincere faith that is in you, which lived first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice and, I am persuaded, in you also. 

\bibverse{6} For this cause, I remind you that you should stir up the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands. \bibverse{7} For God didn’t give us a spirit of fear, but of power, love, and self-control. \bibverse{8} Therefore don’t be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner; but endure hardship for the Good News according to the power of God, \bibverse{9} who saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before times eternal, \bibverse{10} but has now been revealed by the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who abolished death, and brought life and immortality to light through the Good News. \bibverse{11} For this I was appointed as a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles. \bibverse{12} For this cause I also suffer these things. 

Yet I am not ashamed, for I know him whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able to guard that which I have committed to him against that day. 

\bibverse{13} Hold the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. \bibverse{14} That good thing which was committed to you, guard through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us. 

\bibverse{15} This you know, that all who are in Asia turned away from me, of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes. \bibverse{16} May the Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain, \bibverse{17} but when he was in Rome, he sought me diligently and found me \bibverse{18} (the Lord grant to him to find the Lord’s mercy in that day); and in how many things he served at Ephesus, you know very well.

\bibverse{1} You therefore, my child, be strengthened in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. \bibverse{2} The things which you have heard from me among many witnesses, commit the same things to faithful men who will be able to teach others also. \bibverse{3} You therefore must endure hardship as a good soldier of Christ Jesus. \bibverse{4} No soldier on duty entangles himself in the affairs of life, that he may please him who enrolled him as a soldier. \bibverse{5} Also, if anyone competes in athletics, he isn’t crowned unless he has competed by the rules. \bibverse{6} The farmer who labors must be the first to get a share of the crops. \bibverse{7} Consider what I say, and may the Lord give you understanding in all things. 

\bibverse{8} Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, of the offspring+ 2:8 or, seed of David, according to my Good News, \bibverse{9} in which I suffer hardship to the point of chains as a criminal. But God’s word isn’t chained. \bibverse{10} Therefore I endure all things for the chosen ones’ sake, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory. \bibverse{11} This saying is trustworthy: “For if we died with him, we will also live with him. \bibverse{12} If we endure, we will also reign with him. If we deny him, he also will deny us. \bibverse{13} If we are faithless, he remains faithful; for he can’t deny himself.” 

\bibverse{14} Remind them of these things, charging them in the sight of the Lord that they don’t argue about words to no profit, to the subverting of those who hear. 

\bibverse{15} Give diligence to present yourself approved by God, a workman who doesn’t need to be ashamed, properly handling the Word of Truth. \bibverse{16} But shun empty chatter, for it will go further in ungodliness, \bibverse{17} and those words will consume like gangrene, of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus: \bibverse{18} men who have erred concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection is already past, and overthrowing the faith of some. \bibverse{19} However, God’s firm foundation stands, having this seal: “The Lord knows those who are his,”+ 2:19 Numbers 16:5 and, “Let every one who names the name of the Lord+ 2:19 TR reads “Christ” instead of “the Lord” depart from unrighteousness.” 

\bibverse{20} Now in a large house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of clay. Some are for honor and some for dishonor. \bibverse{21} If anyone therefore purges himself from these, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified, and suitable for the master’s use, prepared for every good work. 

\bibverse{22} Flee from youthful lusts; but pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart. \bibverse{23} But refuse foolish and ignorant questionings, knowing that they generate strife. \bibverse{24} The Lord’s servant must not quarrel, but be gentle toward all, able to teach, patient, \bibverse{25} in gentleness correcting those who oppose him. Perhaps God may give them repentance leading to a full knowledge of the truth, \bibverse{26} and they may recover themselves out of the devil’s snare, having been taken captive by him to do his will.

\bibverse{1} But know this: that in the last days, grievous times will come. \bibverse{2} For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, \bibverse{3} without natural affection, unforgiving, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, not lovers of good, \bibverse{4} traitors, headstrong, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, \bibverse{5} holding a form of godliness but having denied its power. Turn away from these, also. \bibverse{6} For some of these are people who creep into houses and take captive gullible women loaded down with sins, led away by various lusts, \bibverse{7} always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. \bibverse{8} Even as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these also oppose the truth, men corrupted in mind, who concerning the faith are rejected. \bibverse{9} But they will proceed no further. For their folly will be evident to all men, as theirs also came to be. 

\bibverse{10} But you followed my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, patience, love, steadfastness, \bibverse{11} persecutions, and sufferings—those things that happened to me at Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. I endured those persecutions. The Lord delivered me out of them all. \bibverse{12} Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution. \bibverse{13} But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived. \bibverse{14} But you remain in the things which you have learned and have been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them. \bibverse{15} From infancy, you have known the holy Scriptures which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. \bibverse{16} Every Scripture is God-breathed and+ 3:16 or, Every writing inspired by God is profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction in righteousness, \bibverse{17} that each person who belongs to God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work.

\bibverse{1} I command you therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who will judge the living and the dead at his appearing and his Kingdom: \bibverse{2} preach the word; be urgent in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and exhort with all patience and teaching. \bibverse{3} For the time will come when they will not listen to the sound doctrine, but having itching ears, will heap up for themselves teachers after their own lusts, \bibverse{4} and will turn away their ears from the truth, and turn away to fables. \bibverse{5} But you be sober in all things, suffer hardship, do the work of an evangelist, and fulfill your ministry. 

\bibverse{6} For I am already being offered, and the time of my departure has come. \bibverse{7} I have fought the good fight. I have finished the course. I have kept the faith. \bibverse{8} From now on, the crown of righteousness is stored up for me, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give to me on that day; and not to me only, but also to all those who have loved his appearing. 

\bibverse{9} Be diligent to come to me soon, \bibverse{10} for Demas left me, having loved this present world, and went to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia; and Titus to Dalmatia. \bibverse{11} Only Luke is with me. Take Mark and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for service. \bibverse{12} But I sent Tychicus to Ephesus. \bibverse{13} Bring the cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus when you come—and the books, especially the parchments. \bibverse{14} Alexander the coppersmith did much evil to me. The Lord will repay him according to his deeds. \bibverse{15} Beware of him, for he greatly opposed our words. 

\bibverse{16} At my first defense, no one came to help me, but all left me. May it not be held against them. \bibverse{17} But the Lord stood by me and strengthened me, that through me the message might be fully proclaimed, and that all the Gentiles might hear. So I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion. \bibverse{18} And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work and will preserve me for his heavenly Kingdom. To him be the glory forever and ever. Amen. 

\bibverse{19} Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus. \bibverse{20} Erastus remained at Corinth, but I left Trophimus at Miletus sick. \bibverse{21} Be diligent to come before winter. Eubulus salutes you, as do Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers. 

\bibverse{22} The Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Grace be with you. Amen.
