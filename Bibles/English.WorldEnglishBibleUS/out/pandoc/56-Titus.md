## Blessings
[1]{.bibleverse} Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ,^[**1:1** “Christ” means “Anointed One”.] according to the faith of God’s chosen ones and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness, [2]{.bibleverse} in hope of eternal life, which God, who can’t lie, promised before time began; [3]{.bibleverse} but in his own time revealed his word in the message with which I was entrusted according to the commandment of God our Savior, [4]{.bibleverse} to Titus, my true child according to a common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior.

## Regulations Governing the Appointment of Elders as Church Leaders
[5]{.bibleverse} I left you in Crete for this reason, that you would set in order the things that were lacking and appoint elders in every city, as I directed you— [6]{.bibleverse} if anyone is blameless, the husband of one wife, having children who believe, who are not accused of loose or unruly behavior. [7]{.bibleverse} For the overseer must be blameless, as God’s steward, not self-pleasing, not easily angered, not given to wine, not violent, not greedy for dishonest gain; [8]{.bibleverse} but given to hospitality, a lover of good, sober minded, fair, holy, self-controlled, [9]{.bibleverse} holding to the faithful word which is according to the teaching, that he may be able to exhort in the sound doctrine, and to convict those who contradict him.

## Rules of conduct against malicious seducers and hypocritical false teachers
[10]{.bibleverse} For there are also many unruly men, vain talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision, [11]{.bibleverse} whose mouths must be stopped: men who overthrow whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for dishonest gain’s sake. [12]{.bibleverse} One of them, a prophet of their own, said, “Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, and idle gluttons.” [13]{.bibleverse} This testimony is true. For this cause, reprove them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith, [14]{.bibleverse} not paying attention to Jewish fables and commandments of men who turn away from the truth. [15]{.bibleverse} To the pure, all things are pure, but to those who are defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure; but both their mind and their conscience are defiled. [16]{.bibleverse} They profess that they know God, but by their deeds they deny him, being abominable, disobedient, and unfit for any good work.

## Regulations for individual farms in the community
[1]{.bibleverse} But say the things which fit sound doctrine, [2]{.bibleverse} that older men should be temperate, sensible, sober minded, sound in faith, in love, and in perseverance, [3]{.bibleverse} and that older women likewise be reverent in behavior, not slanderers nor enslaved to much wine, teachers of that which is good, [4]{.bibleverse} that they may train the young wives to love their husbands, to love their children, [5]{.bibleverse} to be sober minded, chaste, workers at home, kind, being in subjection to their own husbands, that God’s word may not be blasphemed. [6]{.bibleverse} Likewise, exhort the younger men to be sober minded. [7]{.bibleverse} In all things show yourself an example of good works. In your teaching, show integrity, seriousness, incorruptibility, [8]{.bibleverse} and soundness of speech that can’t be condemned, that he who opposes you may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say about us. [9]{.bibleverse} Exhort servants to be in subjection to their own masters and to be well-pleasing in all things, not contradicting, [10]{.bibleverse} not stealing, but showing all good fidelity, that they may adorn the doctrine of God, our Savior, in all things.

## Justification of these regulations referring to the grace of God that appeared in the world
[11]{.bibleverse} For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men, [12]{.bibleverse} instructing us to the intent that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we would live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present age; [13]{.bibleverse} looking for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ, [14]{.bibleverse} who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify for himself a people for his own possession, zealous for good works. [15]{.bibleverse} Say these things and exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no one despise you.

## On behavior against pagan authorities and non-Christians and on the path of Christians as a renewed people
[1]{.bibleverse} Remind them to be in subjection to rulers and to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good work, [2]{.bibleverse} to speak evil of no one, not to be contentious, to be gentle, showing all humility toward all men. [3]{.bibleverse} For we were also once foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another. [4]{.bibleverse} But when the kindness of God our Savior and his love toward mankind appeared, [5]{.bibleverse} not by works of righteousness which we did ourselves, but according to his mercy, he saved us through the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit, [6]{.bibleverse} whom he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior; [7]{.bibleverse} that being justified by his grace, we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.

## Conclusion on behavior in the face of doctrinal aberrations and their representatives
[8]{.bibleverse} This saying is faithful, and concerning these things I desire that you insist confidently, so that those who have believed God may be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable to men; [9]{.bibleverse} but shun foolish questionings, genealogies, strife, and disputes about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain. [10]{.bibleverse} Avoid a factious man after a first and second warning, [11]{.bibleverse} knowing that such a one is perverted and sinful, being self-condemned.

## Final personal comments, last orders and greetings
[12]{.bibleverse} When I send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, be diligent to come to me to Nicopolis, for I have determined to winter there. [13]{.bibleverse} Send Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey speedily, that nothing may be lacking for them. [14]{.bibleverse} Let our people also learn to maintain good works to meet necessary needs, that they may not be unfruitful. [15]{.bibleverse} All who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.
