## [1](#book-Ps151) {.unnumbered #chapter-Ps151-1} 
151This Psalm is a genuine one of David, though extra,^[**1:0** or, supernumerary] composed when he fought in single combat with Goliath. **[1]{#verse-Ps151-1-1}** I was small among my brothers, and youngest in my father’s house. I tended my father’s sheep. **[2]{#verse-Ps151-1-2}** My hands formed a musical instrument, and my fingers tuned a lyre. **[3]{#verse-Ps151-1-3}** Who shall tell my Lord? The Lord himself, he himself hears. **[4]{#verse-Ps151-1-4}** He sent forth his angel and took me from my father’s sheep, and he anointed me with his anointing oil. **[5]{#verse-Ps151-1-5}** My brothers were handsome and tall; but the Lord didn’t take pleasure in them. **[6]{#verse-Ps151-1-6}** I went out to meet the Philistine, and he cursed me by his idols. **[7]{#verse-Ps151-1-7}** But I drew his own sword and beheaded him, and removed reproach from the children of Israel.
