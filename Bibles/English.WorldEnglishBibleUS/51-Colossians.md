## The incomparable greatness of the risen Christ and the redemption wrought by his death on the cross
^14^ in whom we have our redemption,^a^ the forgiveness of our sins. ^15^ He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation. ^16^ For by him all things were created in the heavens and on the earth, visible things and invisible things, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers.

## Full knowledge of the salvation created by Christ saves the Colossians from being deceived by false teachings

## Rules for the conduct of men and women in the worship of the Christian church


## Strength and consolation of the warrior of Christ in the battle of suffering
^8^ Be careful that you don’t let anyone rob you through his philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the elemental spirits of the world, and not after Christ.

## By the merit of Christ you have achieved salvation, and in Christ (dead, buried and risen with him) you are freed from the dominion of spiritual powers
^9^ For in him all the fullness of the Deity dwells bodily, ^10^ and in him you are made full, who is the head of all principality and power. ^11^ In him you were also circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the sins of the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ, ^12^ having been buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through faith in the working of God, who raised him from the dead.

## Warning of useless verbiage, empty talk and falsehoods of false teachers

## Observing external customs and the hypocritical nature of false teachers are useless and carnal
^16^ Let no one therefore judge you in eating or drinking, or with respect to a feast day or a new moon or a Sabbath day,

## Longing of the apostle; your frustrated travel plans
^17^ which are a shadow of the things to come; but the body is Christ’s. ^18^ Let no one rob you of your prize by self-abasement and worshiping of the angels, dwelling in the things which he has not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,

## The hopelessness of the false teachers due to the solid foundation of the church laid by God
^19^ and not holding firmly to the Head, from whom all the body, being supplied and knit together through the joints and ligaments, grows with God’s growth. ^20^ If you died with Christ from the elemental spirits of the world, why, as though living in the world, do you subject yourselves to ordinances, ^21^ “Don’t handle, nor taste, nor touch” ^22^ (all of which perish with use), according to the precepts and doctrines of men? ^23^ These things indeed appear like wisdom in self-imposed worship, humility, and severity to the body, but aren’t of any value against the indulgence of the flesh.

^5^ Put to death therefore your members which are on the earth: sexual immorality, uncleanness, depraved passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry.

^6^ For these things’ sake the wrath of God comes on the children of disobedience. ^7^ You also once walked in those, when you lived in them,

## Assistantship Requirements

## Reference to the example of Paul and a reminder to persevere and hold fast to traditional teachings and Holy Scripture despite all suffering
^10^ and have put on the new man, who is being renewed in knowledge after the image of his Creator, ^11^ where there can’t be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, bondservant, or free person; but Christ is all, and in all.

## Attract what comes from above
^12^ Put on therefore, as God’s chosen ones, holy and beloved, a heart of compassion, kindness, lowliness, humility, and perseverance; ^13^ bearing with one another, and forgiving each other, if any man has a complaint against any; even as Christ forgave you, so you also do.

## Conclusion of the previous instructions referring to the community as bearer of the truth of salvation
^14^ Above all these things, walk in love, which is the bond of perfection. ^15^ And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to which also you were called in one body, and be thankful. ^16^ Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly; in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your heart to the Lord.

## Personal greeting and blessing from Pablo
^17^ Whatever you do, in word or in deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.

## House sign (i.e. reminders about Christian family life)
^18^ Wives, be in subjection to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. ^19^ Husbands, love your wives, and don’t be bitter against them. ^20^ Children, obey your parents in all things, for this pleases the Lord. ^21^ Fathers, don’t provoke your children, so that they won’t be discouraged. ^22^ Servants, obey in all things those who are your masters according to the flesh, not just when they are looking, as men pleasers, but in singleness of heart, fearing God. ^23^ And whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men, ^24^ knowing that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance; for you serve the Lord Christ. ^25^ But he who does wrong will receive again for the wrong that he has done, and there is no partiality.

## The correct Christian exercise of piety and the blessing that was promised


## Solemn reference of the apostle to the near end of his life; his self-testimony and his hope

They will make known to you everything that is going on here. ^10^ Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner, greets you, and Mark the cousin of Barnabas (concerning whom you received instructions, “if he comes to you, receive him”), ^11^ and Jesus who is called Justus. These are my only fellow workers for God’s Kingdom who are of the circumcision, men who have been a comfort to me.

## General rules for Timothy, especially regarding his youth
^12^ Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, salutes you, always striving for you in his prayers, that you may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God.

## No pain desperate for the dead
^13^ For I testify about him that he has great zeal for you, and for those in Laodicea, and for those in Hierapolis. ^14^ Luke the beloved physician and Demas greet you. ^15^ Greet the brothers who are in Laodicea, with Nymphas and the assembly that is in his house. ^16^ When this letter has been read among you, cause it to be read also in the assembly of the Laodiceans, and that you also read the letter from Laodicea. ^17^ Tell Archippus, “Take heed to the ministry which you have received in the Lord, that you fulfill it.” ^18^ I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand. Remember my chains. Grace be with you. Amen.
