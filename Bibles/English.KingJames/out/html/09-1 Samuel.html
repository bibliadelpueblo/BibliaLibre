<p><sup class='bibleverse'>1</sup> Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite: <sup class='bibleverse'>2</sup> And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children. <sup class='bibleverse'>3</sup> And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the LORD of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, were there.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>4</sup> And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions: <sup class='bibleverse'>5</sup> But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah: but the LORD had shut up her womb.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>6</sup> And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her fret, because the LORD had shut up her womb.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>7</sup> And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the LORD, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>8</sup> Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? am not I better to thee than ten sons?</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>9</sup> So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the LORD. <sup class='bibleverse'>10</sup> And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the LORD, and wept sore.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>11</sup> And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>12</sup> And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD, that Eli marked her mouth.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>13</sup> Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken. <sup class='bibleverse'>14</sup> And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee. <sup class='bibleverse'>15</sup> And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the LORD.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>16</sup> Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>17</sup> Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him. <sup class='bibleverse'>18</sup> And she said, Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more sad.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>19</sup> And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD remembered her. <sup class='bibleverse'>20</sup> Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived, that she bare a son, and called his name Samuel, saying, Because I have asked him of the LORD.<sup>[<strong>1:20</strong> when…: Heb. in revolution of days]</sup>[<strong>1:20</strong> Samuel: that is, Asked of God] <sup class='bibleverse'>21</sup> And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow. <sup class='bibleverse'>22</sup> But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, I will not go up until the child be weaned, and then I will bring him, that he may appear before the LORD, and there abide for ever. <sup class='bibleverse'>23</sup> And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only the LORD establish his word. So the woman abode, and gave her son suck until she weaned him.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>24</sup> And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto the house of the LORD in Shiloh: and the child was young. <sup class='bibleverse'>25</sup> And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli. <sup class='bibleverse'>26</sup> And she said, Oh my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the LORD. <sup class='bibleverse'>27</sup> For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my petition which I asked of him: <sup class='bibleverse'>28</sup> Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the LORD. And he worshipped the LORD there.<sup>[<strong>1:28</strong> lent him: or, returned him, whom I have obtained by petition]</sup>[<strong>1:28</strong> he shall…: or, he whom I have obtained by petition shall be returned]</p>
<h1 id="section-1">2</h1>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>1</sup> And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the LORD, mine horn is exalted in the LORD: my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies; because I rejoice in thy salvation. <sup class='bibleverse'>2</sup> There is none holy as the LORD: for there is none beside thee: neither is there any rock like our God. <sup class='bibleverse'>3</sup> Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogancy come out of your mouth: for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>4</sup> The bows of the mighty men are broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength. <sup class='bibleverse'>5</sup> They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; and they that were hungry ceased: so that the barren hath born seven; and she that hath many children is waxed feeble. <sup class='bibleverse'>6</sup> The LORD killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up. <sup class='bibleverse'>7</sup> The LORD maketh poor, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and lifteth up. <sup class='bibleverse'>8</sup> He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill, to set them among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth are the LORD’s, and he hath set the world upon them. <sup class='bibleverse'>9</sup> He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail. <sup class='bibleverse'>10</sup> The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces; out of heaven shall he thunder upon them: the LORD shall judge the ends of the earth; and he shall give strength unto his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>11</sup> And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did minister unto the LORD before Eli the priest.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>12</sup> Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not the LORD. <sup class='bibleverse'>13</sup> And the priests’ custom with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest’s servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand; <sup class='bibleverse'>14</sup> And he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself. So they did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither. <sup class='bibleverse'>15</sup> Also before they burnt the fat, the priest’s servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw. <sup class='bibleverse'>16</sup> And if any man said unto him, Let them not fail to burn the fat presently, and then take as much as thy soul desireth; then he would answer him, Nay; but thou shalt give it me now: and if not, I will take it by force.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>17</sup> Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD: for men abhorred the offering of the LORD.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>18</sup> But Samuel ministered before the LORD, being a child, girded with a linen ephod. <sup class='bibleverse'>19</sup> Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>20</sup> And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The LORD give thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the LORD. And they went unto their own home.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>21</sup> And the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bare three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the LORD.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>22</sup> Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>23</sup> And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your evil dealings by all this people.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>24</sup> Nay, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: ye make the LORD’s people to transgress.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>25</sup> If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if a man sin against the LORD, who shall intreat for him? Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the LORD would slay them. <sup class='bibleverse'>26</sup> And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with the LORD, and also with men.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>27</sup> And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh’s house? <sup class='bibleverse'>28</sup> And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to offer upon mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the children of Israel? <sup class='bibleverse'>29</sup> Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which I have commanded in my habitation; and honourest thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people? <sup class='bibleverse'>30</sup> Wherefore the LORD God of Israel saith, I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but now the LORD saith, Be it far from me; for them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed. <sup class='bibleverse'>31</sup> Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father’s house, that there shall not be an old man in thine house. <sup class='bibleverse'>32</sup> And thou shalt see an enemy in my habitation, in all the wealth which God shall give Israel: and there shall not be an old man in thine house for ever.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>33</sup> And the man of thine, whom I shall not cut off from mine altar, shall be to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thine heart: and all the increase of thine house shall die in the flower of their age.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>34</sup> And this shall be a sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas; in one day they shall die both of them. <sup class='bibleverse'>35</sup> And I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in mine heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever. <sup class='bibleverse'>36</sup> And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in thine house shall come and crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests’ offices, that I may eat a piece of bread.<sup>[<strong>2:36</strong> Put: Heb.

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>1</sup> And the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before Eli. And the word of the LORD was precious in those days; there was no open vision. <sup class='bibleverse'>2</sup> And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place, and his eyes began to wax dim, that he could not see; <sup class='bibleverse'>3</sup> And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep; <sup class='bibleverse'>4</sup> That the LORD called Samuel: and he answered, Here am I. <sup class='bibleverse'>5</sup> And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down. <sup class='bibleverse'>6</sup> And the LORD called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again. <sup class='bibleverse'>7</sup> Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the LORD yet revealed unto him.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>8</sup> And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And Eli perceived that the LORD had called the child. <sup class='bibleverse'>9</sup> Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, LORD; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place. <sup class='bibleverse'>10</sup> And the LORD came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>11</sup> And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle. <sup class='bibleverse'>12</sup> In that day I will perform against Eli all things which I have spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an end.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>13</sup> For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not.<sup>[<strong>3:13</strong> For I…: or, And I will tell him]</sup>[<strong>3:13</strong> vile: or, accursed]<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>14</sup> And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli’s house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>15</sup> And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the LORD. And Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision. <sup class='bibleverse'>16</sup> Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered, Here am I. <sup class='bibleverse'>17</sup> And he said, What is the thing that the Lord hath said unto thee? I pray thee hide it not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide any thing from me of all the things that he said unto thee.<sup>[<strong>3:17</strong> more also: Heb. so add]</sup>[<strong>3:17</strong> thing: or, word] <sup class='bibleverse'>18</sup> And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him.

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>19</sup> And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground. <sup class='bibleverse'>20</sup> And all Israel from Dan even to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the LORD.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>21</sup> And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh: for the LORD revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD.</p>
<h1 id="section-3">4</h1>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>1</sup> And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and pitched beside Eben-ezer: and the Philistines pitched in Aphek.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>2</sup> And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines: and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men.<sup>[<strong>4:2</strong> they joined…: Heb. the battle was spread]</sup>[<strong>4:2</strong> army: Heb. array]</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>3</sup> And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Wherefore hath the LORD smitten us to day before the Philistines?

And they understood that the ark of the LORD was come into the camp. <sup class='bibleverse'>7</sup> And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come into the camp.

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>10</sup> And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled every man into his tent: and there was a very great slaughter; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen. <sup class='bibleverse'>11</sup> And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>12</sup> And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes rent, and with earth upon his head. <sup class='bibleverse'>13</sup> And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside watching: for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city, and told it, all the city cried out. <sup class='bibleverse'>14</sup> And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What meaneth the noise of this tumult? And the man came in hastily, and told Eli. <sup class='bibleverse'>15</sup> Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were dim, that he could not see.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>16</sup> And the man said unto Eli, I am he that came out of the army, and I fled to day out of the army.

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>19</sup> And his daughter in law, Phinehas’ wife, was with child, near to be delivered: and when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken, and that her father in law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and travailed; for her pains came upon her.<sup>[<strong>4:19</strong> be delivered: or, cry out]</sup>[<strong>4:19</strong> came: Heb. were turned] <sup class='bibleverse'>20</sup> And about the time of her death the women that stood by her said unto her, Fear not; for thou hast born a son.

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>1</sup> And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it from Eben-ezer unto Ashdod. <sup class='bibleverse'>2</sup> When the Philistines took the ark of God, they brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.</p>

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>6</sup> And Samuel said unto the people, It is the LORD that advanced Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64" role="doc-noteref"><sup>64</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>7</sup> Now therefore stand still, that I may reason with you before the LORD of all the righteous acts of the LORD, which he did to you and to your fathers.<sup>[<strong>12:7</strong> righteous…: Heb. righteousnesses, or, benefits]</sup>[<strong>12:7</strong> to: Heb. with] <sup class='bibleverse'>8</sup> When Jacob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried unto the LORD, then the LORD sent Moses and Aaron, which brought forth your fathers out of Egypt, and made them dwell in this place. <sup class='bibleverse'>9</sup> And when they forgat the LORD their God, he sold them into the hand of Sisera, captain of the host of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought against them. <sup class='bibleverse'>10</sup> And they cried unto the LORD, and said, We have sinned, because we have forsaken the LORD, and have served Baalim and Ashtaroth: but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve thee. <sup class='bibleverse'>11</sup> And the LORD sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side, and ye dwelled safe. <sup class='bibleverse'>12</sup> And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, ye said unto me, Nay; but a king shall reign over us: when the LORD your God was your king. <sup class='bibleverse'>13</sup> Now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen, and whom ye have desired! and, behold, the LORD hath set a king over you. <sup class='bibleverse'>14</sup> If ye will fear the LORD, and serve him, and obey his voice, and not rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall both ye and also the king that reigneth over you continue following the LORD your God:<sup>[<strong>12:14</strong> commandment: Heb. mouth]</sup>[<strong>12:14</strong> continue…: Heb. be after] <sup class='bibleverse'>15</sup> But if ye will not obey the voice of the LORD, but rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall the hand of the LORD be against you, as it was against your fathers.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>16</sup> Now therefore stand and see this great thing, which the LORD will do before your eyes. <sup class='bibleverse'>17</sup> Is it not wheat harvest to day? I will call unto the LORD, and he shall send thunder and rain; that ye may perceive and see that your wickedness is great, which ye have done in the sight of the LORD, in asking you a king. <sup class='bibleverse'>18</sup> So Samuel called unto the LORD; and the LORD sent thunder and rain that day: and all the people greatly feared the LORD and Samuel. <sup class='bibleverse'>19</sup> And all the people said unto Samuel, Pray for thy servants unto the LORD thy God, that we die not: for we have added unto all our sins this evil, to ask us a king.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>20</sup> And Samuel said unto the people, Fear not: ye have done all this wickedness: yet turn not aside from following the LORD, but serve the LORD with all your heart; <sup class='bibleverse'>21</sup> And turn ye not aside: for then should ye go after vain things, which cannot profit nor deliver; for they are vain. <sup class='bibleverse'>22</sup> For the LORD will not forsake his people for his great name’s sake: because it hath pleased the LORD to make you his people. <sup class='bibleverse'>23</sup> Moreover as for me, God forbid that I should sin against the LORD in ceasing to pray for you: but I will teach you the good and the right way:<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65" role="doc-noteref"><sup>65</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>24</sup> Only fear the LORD, and serve him in truth with all your heart: for consider how great things he hath done for you.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66" role="doc-noteref"><sup>66</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>25</sup> But if ye shall still do wickedly, ye shall be consumed, both ye and your king.</p>

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>1</sup> Saul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over Israel,<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67" role="doc-noteref"><sup>67</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>2</sup> Saul chose him three thousand men of Israel; whereof two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in mount Beth-el, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent. <sup class='bibleverse'>3</sup> And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba, and the Philistines heard of it.

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>5</sup> And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude: and they came up, and pitched in Michmash, eastward from Beth-aven. <sup class='bibleverse'>6</sup> When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for the people were distressed,) then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits. <sup class='bibleverse'>7</sup> And some of the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead.

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>8</sup> And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel had appointed: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him. <sup class='bibleverse'>9</sup> And Saul said, Bring hither a burnt offering to me, and peace offerings.

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>11</sup> And Samuel said, What hast thou done?

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>15</sup> And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of Benjamin.

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>17</sup> And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned unto the way that leadeth to Ophrah, unto the land of Shual: <sup class='bibleverse'>18</sup> And another company turned the way to Beth-horon: and another company turned to the way of the border that looketh to the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.</p>

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>4</sup> And between the passages, by which Jonathan sought to go over unto the Philistines’ garrison, there was a sharp rock on the one side, and a sharp rock on the other side: and the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh. <sup class='bibleverse'>5</sup> The forefront of the one was situate northward over against Michmash, and the other southward over against Gibeah.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77" role="doc-noteref"><sup>77</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>6</sup> And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be that the LORD will work for us: for there is no restraint to the LORD to save by many or by few. <sup class='bibleverse'>7</sup> And his armourbearer said unto him, Do all that is in thine heart: turn thee; behold, I am with thee according to thy heart. <sup class='bibleverse'>8</sup> Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over unto these men, and we will discover ourselves unto them. <sup class='bibleverse'>9</sup> If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up unto them.<a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78" role="doc-noteref"><sup>78</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>10</sup> But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up: for the LORD hath delivered them into our hand: and this shall be a sign unto us. <sup class='bibleverse'>11</sup> And both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves. <sup class='bibleverse'>12</sup> And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armourbearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will shew you a thing. And Jonathan said unto his armourbearer, Come up after me: for the LORD hath delivered them into the hand of Israel. <sup class='bibleverse'>13</sup> And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armourbearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his armourbearer slew after him. <sup class='bibleverse'>14</sup> And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armourbearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were an half acre of land, which a yoke of oxen might plow.<a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79" role="doc-noteref"><sup>79</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>15</sup> And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among all the people: the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled, and the earth quaked: so it was a very great trembling.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80" role="doc-noteref"><sup>80</sup></a></p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>16</sup> And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and, behold, the multitude melted away, and they went on beating down one another. <sup class='bibleverse'>17</sup> Then said Saul unto the people that were with him, Number now, and see who is gone from us. And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armourbearer were not there. <sup class='bibleverse'>18</sup> And Saul said unto Ahiah, Bring hither the ark of God. For the ark of God was at that time with the children of Israel.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>19</sup> And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that the noise that was in the host of the Philistines went on and increased: and Saul said unto the priest, Withdraw thine hand.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81" role="doc-noteref"><sup>81</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>20</sup> And Saul and all the people that were with him assembled themselves, and they came to the battle: and, behold, every man’s sword was against his fellow, and there was a very great discomfiture.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82" role="doc-noteref"><sup>82</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>21</sup> Moreover the Hebrews that were with the Philistines before that time, which went up with them into the camp from the country round about, even they also turned to be with the Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan. <sup class='bibleverse'>22</sup> Likewise all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in mount Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed hard after them in the battle. <sup class='bibleverse'>23</sup> So the LORD saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over unto Beth-aven.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>24</sup> And the men of Israel were distressed that day: for Saul had adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food until evening, that I may be avenged on mine enemies. So none of the people tasted any food. <sup class='bibleverse'>25</sup> And all they of the land came to a wood; and there was honey upon the ground. <sup class='bibleverse'>26</sup> And when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honey dropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth: for the people feared the oath. <sup class='bibleverse'>27</sup> But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand, and dipped it in an honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened. <sup class='bibleverse'>28</sup> Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father straitly charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food this day. And the people were faint.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83" role="doc-noteref"><sup>83</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>29</sup> Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: see, I pray you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey. <sup class='bibleverse'>30</sup> How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to day of the spoil of their enemies which they found? for had there not been now a much greater slaughter among the Philistines? <sup class='bibleverse'>31</sup> And they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon: and the people were very faint. <sup class='bibleverse'>32</sup> And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slew them on the ground: and the people did eat them with the blood.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>33</sup> Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against the LORD, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, Ye have transgressed: roll a great stone unto me this day.<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84" role="doc-noteref"><sup>84</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>34</sup> And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say unto them, Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and slay them here, and eat; and sin not against the LORD in eating with the blood.

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>36</sup> And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee. Then said the priest, Let us draw near hither unto God. <sup class='bibleverse'>37</sup> And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he answered him not that day. <sup class='bibleverse'>38</sup> And Saul said, Draw ye near hither, all the chief of the people: and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day.<a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87" role="doc-noteref"><sup>87</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>39</sup> For, as the LORD liveth, which saveth Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die. But there was not a man among all the people that answered him. <sup class='bibleverse'>40</sup> Then said he unto all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said unto Saul, Do what seemeth good unto thee. <sup class='bibleverse'>41</sup> Therefore Saul said unto the LORD God of Israel, Give a perfect lot. And Saul and Jonathan were taken: but the people escaped.<sup>[<strong>14:41</strong> Give…: or, Shew the innocent]</sup>[<strong>14:41</strong> escaped: Heb. went forth] <sup class='bibleverse'>42</sup> And Saul said, Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son. And Jonathan was taken. <sup class='bibleverse'>43</sup> Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And Jonathan told him, and said, I did but taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in mine hand, and, lo, I must die. <sup class='bibleverse'>44</sup> And Saul answered, God do so and more also: for thou shalt surely die, Jonathan. <sup class='bibleverse'>45</sup> And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel? God forbid: as the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he hath wrought with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not. <sup class='bibleverse'>46</sup> Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the Philistines went to their own place.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>47</sup> So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and whithersoever he turned himself, he vexed them. <sup class='bibleverse'>48</sup> And he gathered an host, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them.<a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88" role="doc-noteref"><sup>88</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>49</sup> Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchi-shua: and the names of his two daughters were these; the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal: <sup class='bibleverse'>50</sup> And the name of Saul’s wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz: and the name of the captain of his host was Abner, the son of Ner, Saul’s uncle.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89" role="doc-noteref"><sup>89</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>51</sup> And Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel. <sup class='bibleverse'>52</sup> And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul: and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he took him unto him.</p>
<h1 id="section-14">15</h1>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>1</sup> Samuel also said unto Saul, The LORD sent me to anoint thee to be king over his people, over Israel: now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of the LORD. <sup class='bibleverse'>2</sup> Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I remember that which Amalek did to Israel, how he laid wait for him in the way, when he came up from Egypt. <sup class='bibleverse'>3</sup> Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass. <sup class='bibleverse'>4</sup> And Saul gathered the people together, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah. <sup class='bibleverse'>5</sup> And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley.<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90" role="doc-noteref"><sup>90</sup></a></p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>6</sup> And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for ye shewed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites. <sup class='bibleverse'>7</sup> And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah until thou comest to Shur, that is over against Egypt. <sup class='bibleverse'>8</sup> And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword. <sup class='bibleverse'>9</sup> But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them: but every thing that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91" role="doc-noteref"><sup>91</sup></a></p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>10</sup> Then came the word of the LORD unto Samuel, saying, <sup class='bibleverse'>11</sup> It repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king: for he is turned back from following me, and hath not performed my commandments. And it grieved Samuel; and he cried unto the LORD all night. <sup class='bibleverse'>12</sup> And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a place, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal. <sup class='bibleverse'>13</sup> And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said unto him, Blessed be thou of the LORD: I have performed the commandment of the LORD. <sup class='bibleverse'>14</sup> And Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear? <sup class='bibleverse'>15</sup> And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed. <sup class='bibleverse'>16</sup> Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what the LORD hath said to me this night. And he said unto him, Say on. <sup class='bibleverse'>17</sup> And Samuel said, When thou wast little in thine own sight, wast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel, and the LORD anointed thee king over Israel? <sup class='bibleverse'>18</sup> And the LORD sent thee on a journey, and said, Go and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92" role="doc-noteref"><sup>92</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>19</sup> Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the LORD, but didst fly upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of the LORD? <sup class='bibleverse'>20</sup> And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the LORD, and have gone the way which the LORD sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites. <sup class='bibleverse'>21</sup> But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God in Gilgal. <sup class='bibleverse'>22</sup> And Samuel said, Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams. <sup class='bibleverse'>23</sup> For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, he hath also rejected thee from being king.<a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93" role="doc-noteref"><sup>93</sup></a></p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>24</sup> And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have transgressed the commandment of the LORD, and thy words: because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice. <sup class='bibleverse'>25</sup> Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD. <sup class='bibleverse'>26</sup> And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee: for thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD hath rejected thee from being king over Israel. <sup class='bibleverse'>27</sup> And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle, and it rent. <sup class='bibleverse'>28</sup> And Samuel said unto him, The LORD hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbour of thine, that is better than thou. <sup class='bibleverse'>29</sup> And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he is not a man, that he should repent.<a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94" role="doc-noteref"><sup>94</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>30</sup> Then he said, I have sinned: yet honour me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD thy God. <sup class='bibleverse'>31</sup> So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped the LORD.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>32</sup> Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. And Agag came unto him delicately. And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past. <sup class='bibleverse'>33</sup> And Samuel said, As thy sword hath made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>34</sup> Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul. <sup class='bibleverse'>35</sup> And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death: nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul: and the LORD repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.</p>
<h1 id="section-15">16</h1>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>1</sup> And the LORD said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill thine horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Beth-lehemite: for I have provided me a king among his sons. <sup class='bibleverse'>2</sup> And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear it, he will kill me. And the LORD said, Take an heifer with thee, and say, I am come to sacrifice to the LORD.<a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95" role="doc-noteref"><sup>95</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>3</sup> And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will shew thee what thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom I name unto thee. <sup class='bibleverse'>4</sup> And Samuel did that which the LORD spake, and came to Beth-lehem.

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>11</sup> And Jonathan said unto David, Come, and let us go out into the field.

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>24</sup> So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was come, the king sat him down to eat meat. <sup class='bibleverse'>25</sup> And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, even upon a seat by the wall: and Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul’s side, and David’s place was empty. <sup class='bibleverse'>26</sup> Nevertheless Saul spake not any thing that day: for he thought, Something hath befallen him, he is not clean; surely he is not clean. <sup class='bibleverse'>27</sup> And it came to pass on the morrow, which was the second day of the month, that David’s place was empty: and Saul said unto Jonathan his son, Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to meat, neither yesterday, nor to day? <sup class='bibleverse'>28</sup> And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Beth-lehem: <sup class='bibleverse'>29</sup> And he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he hath commanded me to be there: and now, if I have found favour in thine eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my brethren. Therefore he cometh not unto the king’s table. <sup class='bibleverse'>30</sup> Then Saul’s anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him, Thou son of the perverse rebellious woman, do not I know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own confusion, and unto the confusion of thy mother’s nakedness?<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134" role="doc-noteref"><sup>134</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>31</sup> For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground, thou shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom.

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>35</sup> And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him. <sup class='bibleverse'>36</sup> And he said unto his lad, Run, find out now the arrows which I shoot.

And Jonathan’s lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master. <sup class='bibleverse'>39</sup> But the lad knew not any thing: only Jonathan and David knew the matter. <sup class='bibleverse'>40</sup> And Jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad, and said unto him, Go, carry them to the city.<sup>[<strong>20:40</strong> artillery: Heb. instruments]</sup>[<strong>20:40</strong> his lad: Heb. the lad that was his]</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>41</sup> And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place toward the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded. <sup class='bibleverse'>42</sup> And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the LORD, saying, The LORD be between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed for ever.

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>8</sup> And David said unto Ahimelech, And is there not here under thine hand spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king’s business required haste. <sup class='bibleverse'>9</sup> And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou slewest in the valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod: if thou wilt take that, take it: for there is no other save that here. And David said, There is none like that; give it me.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>10</sup> And David arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath. <sup class='bibleverse'>11</sup> And the servants of Achish said unto him, Is not this David the king of the land? did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands? <sup class='bibleverse'>12</sup> And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid of Achish the king of Gath. <sup class='bibleverse'>13</sup> And he changed his behaviour before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down upon his beard.<a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141" role="doc-noteref"><sup>141</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>14</sup> Then said Achish unto his servants, Lo, ye see the man is mad: wherefore then have ye brought him to me?<a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142" role="doc-noteref"><sup>142</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>15</sup> Have I need of mad men, that ye have brought this fellow to play the mad man in my presence? shall this fellow come into my house?</p>

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>1</sup> David therefore departed thence, and escaped to the cave Adullam: and when his brethren and all his father’s house heard it, they went down thither to him. <sup class='bibleverse'>2</sup> And every one that was in distress, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was discontented, gathered themselves unto him; and he became a captain over them: and there were with him about four hundred men.<sup>[<strong>22:2</strong> was in debt: Heb. had a creditor]</sup>[<strong>22:2</strong> discontented: Heb. bitter of soul]</p>

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>1</sup> Then they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines fight against Keilah, and they rob the threshingfloors. <sup class='bibleverse'>2</sup> Therefore David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go and smite these Philistines?

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>19</sup> Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood, in the hill of Hachilah, which is on the south of Jeshimon?<sup>[<strong>23:19</strong> on…: Heb. on the right hand]</sup>[<strong>23:19</strong> Jeshimon: or, the wilderness] <sup class='bibleverse'>20</sup> Now therefore, O king, come down according to all the desire of thy soul to come down; and our part shall be to deliver him into the king’s hand. <sup class='bibleverse'>21</sup> And Saul said, Blessed be ye of the LORD; for ye have compassion on me. <sup class='bibleverse'>22</sup> Go, I pray you, prepare yet, and know and see his place where his haunt is, and who hath seen him there: for it is told me that he dealeth very subtilly.<a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149" role="doc-noteref"><sup>149</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>23</sup> See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hideth himself, and come ye again to me with the certainty, and I will go with you: and it shall come to pass, if he be in the land, that I will search him out throughout all the thousands of Judah. <sup class='bibleverse'>24</sup> And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the plain on the south of Jeshimon. <sup class='bibleverse'>25</sup> Saul also and his men went to seek him.

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>4</sup> And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal did shear his sheep. <sup class='bibleverse'>5</sup> And David sent out ten young men, and David said unto the young men, Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name:<a href="#fn159" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref159" role="doc-noteref"><sup>159</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>6</sup> And thus shall ye say to him that liveth in prosperity, Peace be both to thee, and peace be to thine house, and peace be unto all that thou hast. <sup class='bibleverse'>7</sup> And now I have heard that thou hast shearers: now thy shepherds which were with us, we hurt them not, neither was there ought missing unto them, all the while they were in Carmel.<a href="#fn160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref160" role="doc-noteref"><sup>160</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>8</sup> Ask thy young men, and they will shew thee.

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>10</sup> And Nabal answered David’s servants, and said, Who is David? and who is the son of Jesse? there be many servants now a days that break away every man from his master. <sup class='bibleverse'>11</sup> Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers, and give it unto men, whom I know not whence they be?<a href="#fn162" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref162" role="doc-noteref"><sup>162</sup></a></p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>12</sup> So David’s young men turned their way, and went again, and came and told him all those sayings. <sup class='bibleverse'>13</sup> And David said unto his men, Gird ye on every man his sword. And they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on his sword: and there went up after David about four hundred men; and two hundred abode by the stuff.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>14</sup> But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal’s wife, saying, Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master; and he railed on them.<a href="#fn163" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref163" role="doc-noteref"><sup>163</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>15</sup> But the men were very good unto us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we any thing, as long as we were conversant with them, when we were in the fields:<a href="#fn164" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref164" role="doc-noteref"><sup>164</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>16</sup> They were a wall unto us both by night and day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep. <sup class='bibleverse'>17</sup> Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do; for evil is determined against our master, and against all his household: for he is such a son of Belial, that a man cannot speak to him.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>18</sup> Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched corn, and an hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on asses.<a href="#fn165" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref165" role="doc-noteref"><sup>165</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>19</sup> And she said unto her servants, Go on before me; behold, I come after you.

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>32</sup> And David said to Abigail, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which sent thee this day to meet me: <sup class='bibleverse'>33</sup> And blessed be thy advice, and blessed be thou, which hast kept me this day from coming to shed blood, and from avenging myself with mine own hand. <sup class='bibleverse'>34</sup> For in very deed, as the LORD God of Israel liveth, which hath kept me back from hurting thee, except thou hadst hasted and come to meet me, surely there had not been left unto Nabal by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall. <sup class='bibleverse'>35</sup> So David received of her hand that which she had brought him, and said unto her, Go up in peace to thine house; see, I have hearkened to thy voice, and have accepted thy person.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>36</sup> And Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal’s heart was merry within him, for he was very drunken: wherefore she told him nothing, less or more, until the morning light. <sup class='bibleverse'>37</sup> But it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal, and his wife had told him these things, that his heart died within him, and he became as a stone. <sup class='bibleverse'>38</sup> And it came to pass about ten days after, that the LORD smote Nabal, that he died.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>39</sup> And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be the LORD, that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and hath kept his servant from evil: for the LORD hath returned the wickedness of Nabal upon his own head. And David sent and communed with Abigail, to take her to him to wife. <sup class='bibleverse'>40</sup> And when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel, they spake unto her, saying, David sent us unto thee, to take thee to him to wife. <sup class='bibleverse'>41</sup> And she arose, and bowed herself on her face to the earth, and said, Behold, let thine handmaid be a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord. <sup class='bibleverse'>42</sup> And Abigail hasted, and arose, and rode upon an ass, with five damsels of hers that went after her; and she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife.<a href="#fn170" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref170" role="doc-noteref"><sup>170</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>43</sup> David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they were also both of them his wives.</p>

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>1</sup> And the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon? <sup class='bibleverse'>2</sup> Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph. <sup class='bibleverse'>3</sup> And Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon, by the way. But David abode in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness. <sup class='bibleverse'>4</sup> David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was come in very deed.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>5</sup> And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had pitched: and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his host: and Saul lay in the trench, and the people pitched round about him.<a href="#fn172" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref172" role="doc-noteref"><sup>172</sup></a></p>

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>13</sup> Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of an hill afar off; a great space being between them: <sup class='bibleverse'>14</sup> And David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Answerest thou not, Abner? Then Abner answered and said, Who art thou that criest to the king? <sup class='bibleverse'>15</sup> And David said to Abner, Art not thou a valiant man? and who is like to thee in Israel? wherefore then hast thou not kept thy lord the king? for there came one of the people in to destroy the king thy lord. <sup class='bibleverse'>16</sup> This thing is not good that thou hast done. As the LORD liveth, ye are worthy to die, because ye have not kept your master, the LORD’s anointed.

If the LORD have stirred thee up against me, let him accept an offering: but if they be the children of men, cursed be they before the LORD; for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the LORD, saying, Go, serve other gods.<sup>[<strong>26:19</strong> accept: Heb. smell]</sup>[<strong>26:19</strong> abiding: Heb. cleaving] <sup class='bibleverse'>20</sup> Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of the LORD: for the king of Israel is come out to seek a flea, as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>21</sup> Then said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son David: for I will no more do thee harm, because my soul was precious in thine eyes this day: behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly. <sup class='bibleverse'>22</sup> And David answered and said, Behold the king’s spear! and let one of the young men come over and fetch it. <sup class='bibleverse'>23</sup> The LORD render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness: for the LORD delivered thee into my hand to day, but I would not stretch forth mine hand against the LORD’s anointed. <sup class='bibleverse'>24</sup> And, behold, as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes, so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the LORD, and let him deliver me out of all tribulation. <sup class='bibleverse'>25</sup> Then Saul said to David, Blessed be thou, my son David: thou shalt both do great things, and also shalt still prevail.

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>3</sup> Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city.

And he said, I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite; and my master left me, because three days agone I fell sick. <sup class='bibleverse'>14</sup> We made an invasion upon the south of the Cherethites, and upon the coast which belongeth to Judah, and upon the south of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire. <sup class='bibleverse'>15</sup> And David said to him, Canst thou bring me down to this company? And he said, Swear unto me by God, that thou wilt neither kill me, nor deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will bring thee down to this company.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>16</sup> And when he had brought him down, behold, they were spread abroad upon all the earth, eating and drinking, and dancing, because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah. <sup class='bibleverse'>17</sup> And David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day: and there escaped not a man of them, save four hundred young men, which rode upon camels, and fled.<a href="#fn186" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref186" role="doc-noteref"><sup>186</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>18</sup> And David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away: and David rescued his two wives. <sup class='bibleverse'>19</sup> And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor any thing that they had taken to them: David recovered all. <sup class='bibleverse'>20</sup> And David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drave before those other cattle, and said, This is David’s spoil.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>21</sup> And David came to the two hundred men, which were so faint that they could not follow David, whom they had made also to abide at the brook Besor: and they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people that were with him: and when David came near to the people, he saluted them.<a href="#fn187" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref187" role="doc-noteref"><sup>187</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>22</sup> Then answered all the wicked men and men of Belial, of those that went with David, and said, Because they went not with us, we will not give them ought of the spoil that we have recovered, save to every man his wife and his children, that they may lead them away, and depart.<a href="#fn188" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref188" role="doc-noteref"><sup>188</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>23</sup> Then said David, Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that which the LORD hath given us, who hath preserved us, and delivered the company that came against us into our hand. <sup class='bibleverse'>24</sup> For who will hearken unto you in this matter? but as his part is that goeth down to the battle, so shall his part be that tarrieth by the stuff: they shall part alike. <sup class='bibleverse'>25</sup> And it was so from that day forward, that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel unto this day.<a href="#fn189" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref189" role="doc-noteref"><sup>189</sup></a></p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>26</sup> And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil unto the elders of Judah, even to his friends, saying, Behold a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of the LORD;<a href="#fn190" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref190" role="doc-noteref"><sup>190</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>27</sup> To them which were in Beth-el, and to them which were in south Ramoth, and to them which were in Jattir, <sup class='bibleverse'>28</sup> And to them which were in Aroer, and to them which were in Siphmoth, and to them which were in Eshtemoa, <sup class='bibleverse'>29</sup> And to them which were in Rachal, and to them which were in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to them which were in the cities of the Kenites, <sup class='bibleverse'>30</sup> And to them which were in Hormah, and to them which were in Chor-ashan, and to them which were in Athach, <sup class='bibleverse'>31</sup> And to them which were in Hebron, and to all the places where David himself and his men were wont to haunt.</p>
<h1 id="section-30">31</h1>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>1</sup> Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa.<a href="#fn191" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref191" role="doc-noteref"><sup>191</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>2</sup> And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchi-shua, Saul’s sons. <sup class='bibleverse'>3</sup> And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him; and he was sore wounded of the archers.<sup>[<strong>31:3</strong> and the archers: Heb. and the shooters, men with bows]</sup>[<strong>31:3</strong> hit…: Heb. found him] <sup class='bibleverse'>4</sup> Then said Saul unto his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword, and fell upon it.<a href="#fn192" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref192" role="doc-noteref"><sup>192</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>5</sup> And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise upon his sword, and died with him. <sup class='bibleverse'>6</sup> So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armourbearer, and all his men, that same day together.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>7</sup> And when the men of Israel that were on the other side of the valley, and they that were on the other side Jordan, saw that the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>8</sup> And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen in mount Gilboa. <sup class='bibleverse'>9</sup> And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armour, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to publish it in the house of their idols, and among the people. <sup class='bibleverse'>10</sup> And they put his armour in the house of Ashtaroth: and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth-shan.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>11</sup> And when the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead heard of that which the Philistines had done to Saul;+ 31.11 of that: or, concerning him that <sup class='bibleverse'>12</sup> All the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth-shan, and came to Jabesh, and burnt them there. <sup class='bibleverse'>13</sup> And they took their bones, and buried them under a tree at Jabesh, and fasted seven days.</p>
