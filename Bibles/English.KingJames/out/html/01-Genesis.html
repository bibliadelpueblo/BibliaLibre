<p><sup>1</sup> In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. <sup>2</sup> And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup> And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. <sup>4</sup> And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.^*^ <sup>5</sup> And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night.

<p><sup>6</sup> And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.^*^ <sup>7</sup> And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so. <sup>8</sup> And God called the firmament Heaven.

And the evening was, and the morning was etc. <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p><sup>9</sup> And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so. <sup>10</sup> And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good. <sup>11</sup> And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.^*^ <sup>12</sup> And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good. <sup>13</sup> And the evening and the morning were the third day.+ 1.13 And the evening…: Heb.

<p><sup>26</sup> And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. <sup>27</sup> So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. <sup>28</sup> And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.^*^ <a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p><sup>1</sup> Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. <sup>2</sup> And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. <sup>3</sup> And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.^*^ <a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p><sup>4</sup> These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens, <sup>5</sup> And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground. <sup>6</sup> But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.^*^ <sup>7</sup> And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.+ 2.7 of the dust…: Heb. dust of the ground <a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p><sup>8</sup> And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed. <sup>9</sup> And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil. <sup>10</sup> And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads. <sup>11</sup> The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold; <sup>12</sup> And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone. <sup>13</sup> And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.^*^ <sup>14</sup> And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth toward the east of Assyria.

<p><sup>18</sup> And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.^*^ <sup>19</sup> And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof.+ 2.19 Adam: or, the man <sup>20</sup> And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him.+ 2.20 gave: Heb. called <a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p><sup>21</sup> And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof; <sup>22</sup> And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.^*^ <sup>23</sup> And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.+ 2.23 Woman: Heb.

<p><sup>1</sup> Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?^*^ <sup>2</sup> And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden: <sup>3</sup> But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die. <sup>4</sup> And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: <sup>5</sup> For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil. <a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p><sup>6</sup> And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.^*^ <sup>7</sup> And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.+ 3.7 aprons: or, things to gird about <sup>8</sup> And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.+ 3.8 cool: Heb. wind <a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a></p>

<p><sup>11</sup> And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked?

And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup> And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life: <sup>15</sup> And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel. <sup>16</sup> Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.^*^ <a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

<p><sup>1</sup> And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.^*^ <sup>2</sup> And she again bare his brother Abel.

<p><sup>3</sup> And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD.^*^ <sup>4</sup> And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering:+ 4.4 flock: Heb. sheep, or, goats <sup>5</sup> But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell. <a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></p>

<p><sup>9</sup> And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother?

<p><sup>19</sup> And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah. <sup>20</sup> And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and of such as have cattle. <sup>21</sup> And his brother’s name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ. <sup>22</sup> And Zillah, she also bare Tubal-cain, an instructer of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.^*^ <a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p><sup>23</sup> And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.^*^+ 4.23 to my hurt: or, in my hurt <sup>24</sup> If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold. <a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25" role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a></p>

<p><sup>7</sup> And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons’ wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood. <sup>8</sup> Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of fowls, and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth, <sup>9</sup> There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God had commanded Noah. <sup>10</sup> And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth.^*^ <a href="#fn40" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref40" role="doc-noteref"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p><sup>11</sup> In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.^*^ <sup>12</sup> And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights. <a href="#fn41" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref41" role="doc-noteref"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<p><sup>13</sup> In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah’s wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark; <sup>14</sup> They, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind, every bird of every sort.^*^ <sup>15</sup> And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh, wherein is the breath of life. <sup>16</sup> And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him: and the LORD shut him in. <a href="#fn42" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref42" role="doc-noteref"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p><sup>17</sup> And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth. <sup>18</sup> And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters. <sup>19</sup> And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered. <sup>20</sup> Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered.</p>
<p><sup>21</sup> And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man: <sup>22</sup> All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was in the dry land, died.^*^ <sup>23</sup> And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark. <sup>24</sup> And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days. <a href="#fn43" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref43" role="doc-noteref"><sup>43</sup></a></p>

<p><sup>1</sup> And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle that was with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters asswaged; <sup>2</sup> The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained; <sup>3</sup> And the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated.^*^ <a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44" role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<p><sup>4</sup> And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat. <sup>5</sup> And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen.^*^ <a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45" role="doc-noteref"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p><sup>6</sup> And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made: <sup>7</sup> And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth.^*^ <sup>8</sup> Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground; <sup>9</sup> But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for the waters were on the face of the whole earth: then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark.+ 8.9 pulled…: Heb. caused her to come <sup>10</sup> And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark; <sup>11</sup> And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth. <sup>12</sup> And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; which returned not again unto him any more. <a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46" role="doc-noteref"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<p><sup>13</sup> And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry. <sup>14</sup> And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried.</p>
<p><sup>15</sup> And God spake unto Noah, saying, <sup>16</sup> Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons’ wives with thee. <sup>17</sup> Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth. <sup>18</sup> And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons’ wives with him: <sup>19</sup> Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went forth out of the ark.^*^ <a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47" role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a></p>

<p><sup>8</sup> And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying, <sup>9</sup> And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you; <sup>10</sup> And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth. <sup>11</sup> And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup> And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations: <sup>13</sup> I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth. <sup>14</sup> And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud: <sup>15</sup> And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh. <sup>16</sup> And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth. <sup>17</sup> And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant, which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the south. <sup>2</sup> And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold. <sup>3</sup> And he went on his journeys from the south even to Beth-el, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth-el and Hai; <sup>4</sup> Unto the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first: and there Abram called on the name of the LORD.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup> And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents. <sup>6</sup> And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together. <sup>7</sup> And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram’s cattle and the herdmen of Lot’s cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled then in the land. <sup>8</sup> And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we be brethren.^*^ <sup>9</sup> Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left. <a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59" role="doc-noteref"><sup>59</sup></a></p>

<p><sup>21</sup> And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself.^*^ <sup>22</sup> And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth, <sup>23</sup> That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich: <sup>24</sup> Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion. <a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63" role="doc-noteref"><sup>63</sup></a></p>

<p><sup>7</sup> And he said unto him, I am the LORD that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it. <sup>8</sup> And he said, Lord GOD, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it? <sup>9</sup> And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon. <sup>10</sup> And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not. <sup>11</sup> And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them away.</p>

<p><sup>12</sup> And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place: <sup>13</sup> For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it. <sup>14</sup> And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the LORD will destroy this city.

<p><sup>17</sup> And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed. <sup>18</sup> And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my Lord: <sup>19</sup> Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die: <sup>20</sup> Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live. <sup>21</sup> And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken.^*^ <sup>22</sup> Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither.

<p><sup>24</sup> Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven; <sup>25</sup> And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.</p>
<p><sup>26</sup> But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.</p>
<p><sup>27</sup> And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the LORD: <sup>28</sup> And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.</p>

<p><sup>3</sup> But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken; for she is a man’s wife.^*^ <sup>4</sup> But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, Lord, wilt thou slay also a righteous nation? <sup>5</sup> Said he not unto me, She is my sister? and she, even she herself said, He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this.+ 20.5 integrity: or, simplicity, or, sincerity <sup>6</sup> And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her. <sup>7</sup> Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine. <a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77" role="doc-noteref"><sup>77</sup></a></p>
<p><sup>8</sup> Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid. <sup>9</sup> Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done. <sup>10</sup> And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing? <sup>11</sup> And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife’s sake. <sup>12</sup> And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife. <sup>13</sup> And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father’s house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup> And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and womenservants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife. <sup>15</sup> And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell where it pleaseth thee.^*^ <sup>16</sup> And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved. <a href="#fn78" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref78" role="doc-noteref"><sup>78</sup></a></p>
<p><sup>17</sup> So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bare children. <sup>18</sup> For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham’s wife.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did unto Sarah as he had spoken. <sup>2</sup> For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him. <sup>3</sup> And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac. <sup>4</sup> And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as God had commanded him. <sup>5</sup> And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him.</p>
<p><sup>6</sup> And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, so that all that hear will laugh with me. <sup>7</sup> And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should have given children suck? for I have born him a son in his old age. <sup>8</sup> And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast the same day that Isaac was weaned.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup> And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born unto Abraham, mocking. <sup>10</sup> Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac. <sup>11</sup> And the thing was very grievous in Abraham’s sight because of his son.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup> And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called. <sup>13</sup> And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because he is thy seed.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup> And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beer-sheba. <sup>15</sup> And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs. <sup>16</sup> And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept. <sup>17</sup> And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is. <sup>18</sup> Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make him a great nation. <sup>19</sup> And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink. <sup>20</sup> And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer. <sup>21</sup> And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.</p>
<p><sup>22</sup> And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest: <sup>23</sup> Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son’s son: but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.^*^ <sup>24</sup> And Abraham said, I will swear. <sup>25</sup> And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which Abimelech’s servants had violently taken away. <sup>26</sup> And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing: neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to day. <sup>27</sup> And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant. <sup>28</sup> And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves. <sup>29</sup> And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves? <sup>30</sup> And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well. <sup>31</sup> Wherefore he called that place Beer-sheba; because there they sware both of them.+ 21.31 Beer-sheba: that is, The well of the oath <sup>32</sup> Thus they made a covenant at Beer-sheba: then Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines. <a href="#fn79" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref79" role="doc-noteref"><sup>79</sup></a></p>
<p><sup>33</sup> And Abraham planted a grove in Beer-sheba, and called there on the name of the LORD, the everlasting God.^*^ <sup>34</sup> And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines’ land many days. <a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80" role="doc-noteref"><sup>80</sup></a></p>

<p><sup>1</sup> And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.^*^ <sup>2</sup> And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of. <a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81" role="doc-noteref"><sup>81</sup></a></p>
<p><sup>3</sup> And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him. <sup>4</sup> Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off. <sup>5</sup> And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you. <sup>6</sup> And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together. <sup>7</sup> And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?^*^ <sup>8</sup> And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together. <sup>9</sup> And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood. <sup>10</sup> And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son. <a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82" role="doc-noteref"><sup>82</sup></a></p>
<p><sup>11</sup> And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I. <sup>12</sup> And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me. <sup>13</sup> And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son. <sup>14</sup> And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be seen.^*^ <a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83" role="doc-noteref"><sup>83</sup></a></p>
<p><sup>15</sup> And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time, <sup>16</sup> And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son: <sup>17</sup> That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;^*^ <sup>18</sup> And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice. <sup>19</sup> So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beer-sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer-sheba. <a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84" role="doc-noteref"><sup>84</sup></a></p>
<p><sup>20</sup> And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor; <sup>21</sup> Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram, <sup>22</sup> And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel. <sup>23</sup> And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to Nahor, Abraham’s brother.^*^ <sup>24</sup> And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah. <a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85" role="doc-noteref"><sup>85</sup></a></p>

<p><sup>1</sup> And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old: these were the years of the life of Sarah. <sup>2</sup> And Sarah died in Kirjath-arba; the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup> And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the sons of Heth, saying, <sup>4</sup> I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight. <sup>5</sup> And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him, <sup>6</sup> Hear us, my lord: thou art a mighty prince among us: in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead.^*^ <sup>7</sup> And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, even to the children of Heth. <sup>8</sup> And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and intreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar, <sup>9</sup> That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which is in the end of his field; for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace amongst you.+ 23.9 as much…: Heb. full money <sup>10</sup> And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, even of all that went in at the gate of his city, saying,+ 23.10 audience: Heb. ears <sup>11</sup> Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead. <sup>12</sup> And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land. <sup>13</sup> And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead there. <sup>14</sup> And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him, <sup>15</sup> My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver; what is that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead. <a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86" role="doc-noteref"><sup>86</sup></a></p>
<p><sup>16</sup> And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.</p>
<p><sup>17</sup> And the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure <sup>18</sup> Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city. <sup>19</sup> And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre: the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan. <sup>20</sup> And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> And Abraham was old, and well stricken in age: and the LORD had blessed Abraham in all things.^*^ <sup>2</sup> And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh: <sup>3</sup> And I will make thee swear by the LORD, the God of heaven, and the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell: <sup>4</sup> But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son Isaac. <sup>5</sup> And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest? <sup>6</sup> And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again. <a href="#fn87" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref87" role="doc-noteref"><sup>87</sup></a></p>
<p><sup>7</sup> The LORD God of heaven, which took me from my father’s house, and from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and that sware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land; he shall send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence. <sup>8</sup> And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son thither again. <sup>9</sup> And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and sware to him concerning that matter.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup> And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed; for all the goods of his master were in his hand: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor.^*^ <sup>11</sup> And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening, even the time that women go out to draw water.+ 24.11 that…: Heb. that women who draw water go forth <sup>12</sup> And he said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send me good speed this day, and shew kindness unto my master Abraham. <sup>13</sup> Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water: <sup>14</sup> And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master. <a href="#fn88" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref88" role="doc-noteref"><sup>88</sup></a></p>
<p><sup>15</sup> And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham’s brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder. <sup>16</sup> And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her: and she went down to the well, and filled her pitcher, and came up.^*^ <sup>17</sup> And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee, drink a little water of thy pitcher. <sup>18</sup> And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink. <sup>19</sup> And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw water for thy camels also, until they have done drinking. <sup>20</sup> And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels. <sup>21</sup> And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether the LORD had made his journey prosperous or not. <sup>22</sup> And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold;+ 24.22 earring: or, jewel for the forehead <sup>23</sup> And said, Whose daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee: is there room in thy father’s house for us to lodge in? <sup>24</sup> And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, which she bare unto Nahor. <sup>25</sup> She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in. <sup>26</sup> And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the LORD. <sup>27</sup> And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of my master Abraham, who hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth: I being in the way, the LORD led me to the house of my master’s brethren. <sup>28</sup> And the damsel ran, and told them of her mother’s house these things. <a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89" role="doc-noteref"><sup>89</sup></a></p>
<p><sup>29</sup> And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban ran out unto the man, unto the well. <sup>30</sup> And it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets upon his sister’s hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spake the man unto me; that he came unto the man; and, behold, he stood by the camels at the well. <sup>31</sup> And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the LORD; wherefore standest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.</p>
<p><sup>32</sup> And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels, and gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet, and the men’s feet that were with him. <sup>33</sup> And there was set meat before him to eat: but he said, I will not eat, until I have told mine errand. And he said, Speak on. <sup>34</sup> And he said, I am Abraham’s servant. <sup>35</sup> And the LORD hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become great: and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold, and menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and asses. <sup>36</sup> And Sarah my master’s wife bare a son to my master when she was old: and unto him hath he given all that he hath. <sup>37</sup> And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell: <sup>38</sup> But thou shalt go unto my father’s house, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son. <sup>39</sup> And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not follow me. <sup>40</sup> And he said unto me, The LORD, before whom I walk, will send his angel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father’s house: <sup>41</sup> Then shalt thou be clear from this my oath, when thou comest to my kindred; and if they give not thee one, thou shalt be clear from my oath. <sup>42</sup> And I came this day unto the well, and said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go: <sup>43</sup> Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass, that when the virgin cometh forth to draw water, and I say to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water of thy pitcher to drink; <sup>44</sup> And she say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels: let the same be the woman whom the LORD hath appointed out for my master’s son. <sup>45</sup> And before I had done speaking in mine heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto the well, and drew water: and I said unto her, Let me drink, I pray thee. <sup>46</sup> And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: so I drank, and she made the camels drink also. <sup>47</sup> And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor’s son, whom Milcah bare unto him: and I put the earring upon her face, and the bracelets upon her hands. <sup>48</sup> And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed the LORD God of my master Abraham, which had led me in the right way to take my master’s brother’s daughter unto his son. <sup>49</sup> And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left. <sup>50</sup> Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth from the LORD: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good. <sup>51</sup> Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be thy master’s son’s wife, as the LORD hath spoken. <sup>52</sup> And it came to pass, that, when Abraham’s servant heard their words, he worshipped the LORD, bowing himself to the earth. <sup>53</sup> And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things.^*^ <a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90" role="doc-noteref"><sup>90</sup></a></p>

And she said, I will go. <sup>59</sup> And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham’s servant, and his men. <sup>60</sup> And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou art our sister, be thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them. <a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91" role="doc-noteref"><sup>91</sup></a></p>

And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim. <sup>4</sup> And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abidah, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup> And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac. <sup>6</sup> But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country. <sup>7</sup> And these are the days of the years of Abraham’s life which he lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years. <sup>8</sup> Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people. <sup>9</sup> And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre; <sup>10</sup> The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.</p>

<p><sup>24</sup> And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb. <sup>25</sup> And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau. <sup>26</sup> And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau’s heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them. <sup>27</sup> And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents. <sup>28</sup> And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob.^*^ <a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94" role="doc-noteref"><sup>94</sup></a></p>
<p><sup>29</sup> And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he was faint: <sup>30</sup> And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom.^*^+ 25.30 Edom: that is Red <sup>31</sup> And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright. <sup>32</sup> And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me?+ 25.32 at…: Heb. going to die <sup>33</sup> And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob. <sup>34</sup> Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright. <a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95" role="doc-noteref"><sup>95</sup></a></p>

<p><sup>1</sup> And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham.

<p><sup>6</sup> And Isaac dwelt in Gerar: <sup>7</sup> And the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said, She is my sister: for he feared to say, She is my wife; lest, said he, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she was fair to look upon. <sup>8</sup> And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife. <sup>9</sup> And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she is thy wife: and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for her. <sup>10</sup> And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us. <sup>11</sup> And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup> Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an hundredfold: and the LORD blessed him.^*^ <sup>13</sup> And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great: + 26.13 went…: Heb. went going <sup>14</sup> For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great store of servants: and the Philistines envied him.+ 26.14 servants: or, husbandry <sup>15</sup> For all the wells which his father’s servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth. <sup>16</sup> And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we. <a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96" role="doc-noteref"><sup>96</sup></a></p>
<p><sup>17</sup> And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there. <sup>18</sup> And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them. <sup>19</sup> And Isaac’s servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing water.^*^ <sup>20</sup> And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac’s herdmen, saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well Esek; because they strove with him.+ 26.20 Esek: that is, Contention <sup>21</sup> And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah.+ 26.21 Sitnah: that is, Hatred <sup>22</sup> And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.+ 26.22 Rehoboth: that is Room <sup>23</sup> And he went up from thence to Beer-sheba. <sup>24</sup> And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham’s sake. <sup>25</sup> And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the LORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac’s servants digged a well. <a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97" role="doc-noteref"><sup>97</sup></a></p>
<p><sup>26</sup> Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army. <sup>27</sup> And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you? <sup>28</sup> And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with thee: and we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee;^*^ <sup>29</sup> That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou art now the blessed of the LORD.+ 26.29 That…: Heb.

<p><sup>1</sup> And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his eldest son, and said unto him, My son: and he said unto him, Behold, here am I. <sup>2</sup> And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death: <sup>3</sup> Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me some venison;^*^ <sup>4</sup> And make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die. <sup>5</sup> And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son.

And he said, Because the LORD thy God brought it to me.^*^ <sup>21</sup> And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not. <sup>22</sup> And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said, The voice is Jacob’s voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau. <sup>23</sup> And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau’s hands: so he blessed him. <sup>24</sup> And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am. <sup>25</sup> And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son’s venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near to him, and he did eat: and he brought him wine, and he drank. <sup>26</sup> And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son. <sup>27</sup> And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the LORD hath blessed: <sup>28</sup> Therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine: <sup>29</sup> Let people serve thee, and nations bow down to thee: be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother’s sons bow down to thee: cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he that blesseth thee. <a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102" role="doc-noteref"><sup>102</sup></a></p>

And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?+ 27.36 Jacob: that is, A supplanter <sup>37</sup> And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and what shall I do now unto thee, my son?+ 27.37 sustained: or, supported <sup>38</sup> And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? bless me, even me also, O my father.

<p><sup>1</sup> And he heard the words of Laban’s sons, saying, Jacob hath taken away all that was our father’s; and of that which was our father’s hath he gotten all this glory. <sup>2</sup> And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was not toward him as before.^*^ <sup>3</sup> And the LORD said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee. <sup>4</sup> And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock, <sup>5</sup> And said unto them, I see your father’s countenance, that it is not toward me as before; but the God of my father hath been with me. <sup>6</sup> And ye know that with all my power I have served your father. <sup>7</sup> And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but God suffered him not to hurt me. <sup>8</sup> If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the cattle bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstraked shall be thy hire; then bare all the cattle ringstraked. <sup>9</sup> Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given them to me. <sup>10</sup> And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the rams which leaped upon the cattle were ringstraked, speckled, and grisled.+ 31.10 rams: or, he goats <sup>11</sup> And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream, saying, Jacob: And I said, Here am I. <sup>12</sup> And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the rams which leap upon the cattle are ringstraked, speckled, and grisled: for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee. <sup>13</sup> I am the God of Beth-el, where thou anointedst the pillar, and where thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from this land, and return unto the land of thy kindred. <sup>14</sup> And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father’s house? <sup>15</sup> Are we not counted of him strangers? for he hath sold us, and hath quite devoured also our money. <sup>16</sup> For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that is ours, and our children’s: now then, whatsoever God hath said unto thee, do. <a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116" role="doc-noteref"><sup>116</sup></a></p>
<p><sup>17</sup> Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels; <sup>18</sup> And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he had gotten, the cattle of his getting, which he had gotten in Padan-aram, for to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan. <sup>19</sup> And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the images that were her father’s.^*^ <sup>20</sup> And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not that he fled.+ 31.20 unawares…: Heb. the heart of Laban <sup>21</sup> So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead. <sup>22</sup> And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled. <sup>23</sup> And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days’ journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead. <sup>24</sup> And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said unto him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.+ 31.24 either…: Heb. from good to bad <a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117" role="doc-noteref"><sup>117</sup></a></p>
<p><sup>25</sup> Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gilead. <sup>26</sup> And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives taken with the sword? <sup>27</sup> Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp?^*^ <sup>28</sup> And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? thou hast now done foolishly in so doing. <sup>29</sup> It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad. <sup>30</sup> And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore longedst after thy father’s house, yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods? <sup>31</sup> And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me. <sup>32</sup> With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live: before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them. <sup>33</sup> And Laban went into Jacob’s tent, and into Leah’s tent, and into the two maidservants’ tents; but he found them not. Then went he out of Leah’s tent, and entered into Rachel’s tent. <sup>34</sup> Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel’s furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, but found them not.+ 31.34 searched: Heb. felt <sup>35</sup> And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women is upon me.

<p><sup>36</sup> And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast so hotly pursued after me? <sup>37</sup> Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? set it here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both.^*^ <sup>38</sup> This twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten. <sup>39</sup> That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day, or stolen by night. <sup>40</sup> Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes. <sup>41</sup> Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle: and thou hast changed my wages ten times. <sup>42</sup> Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked thee yesternight. <a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119" role="doc-noteref"><sup>119</sup></a></p>
<p><sup>43</sup> And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are my daughters, and these children are my children, and these cattle are my cattle, and all that thou seest is mine: and what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their children which they have born? <sup>44</sup> Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee. <sup>45</sup> And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar. <sup>46</sup> And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the heap. <sup>47</sup> And Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed.^*^+ 31.47 Galeed: that is, The heap of witness, Heb. <sup>48</sup> And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee this day.

<p><sup>3</sup> And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the country of Edom.^*^ <sup>4</sup> And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there until now: <sup>5</sup> And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight. <a href="#fn122" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref122" role="doc-noteref"><sup>122</sup></a></p>
<p><sup>6</sup> And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him. <sup>7</sup> Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the people that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two bands; <sup>8</sup> And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup> And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the LORD which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee: <sup>10</sup> I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands.^*^ <sup>11</sup> Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, and the mother with the children.+ 32.11 with: Heb. upon <sup>12</sup> And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude. <a href="#fn123" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref123" role="doc-noteref"><sup>123</sup></a></p>

For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me.^*^ <sup>21</sup> So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night in the company. <sup>22</sup> And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok. <sup>23</sup> And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had.+ 32.23 sent them: Heb. caused to pass <a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124" role="doc-noteref"><sup>124</sup></a></p>

And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me. <sup>27</sup> And he said unto him, What is thy name?

<p><sup>5</sup> And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, Who are those with thee?

<p><sup>18</sup> And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor’s son. <sup>19</sup> And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob’s daughter: and he was more honourable than all the house of his father.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup> And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city, and communed with the men of their city, saying, <sup>21</sup> These men are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade therein; for the land, behold, it is large enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters. <sup>22</sup> Only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us, to be one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they are circumcised. <sup>23</sup> Shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of theirs be ours? only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell with us. <sup>24</sup> And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger, in the land of Canaan.^*^ <sup>2</sup> These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and the lad was with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father’s wives: and Joseph brought unto his father their evil report. <sup>3</sup> Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colours.+ 37.3 colours: or, pieces <sup>4</sup> And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him. <a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137" role="doc-noteref"><sup>137</sup></a></p>
<p><sup>5</sup> And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren: and they hated him yet the more. <sup>6</sup> And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed: <sup>7</sup> For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf. <sup>8</sup> And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words.</p>
<p><sup>9</sup> And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me. <sup>10</sup> And he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and his father rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth? <sup>11</sup> And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the saying.</p>
<p><sup>12</sup> And his brethren went to feed their father’s flock in Shechem. <sup>13</sup> And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the flock in Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him, Here am I. <sup>14</sup> And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with thy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again.

And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan. <sup>18</sup> And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him. <sup>19</sup> And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.^*^ <sup>20</sup> Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall see what will become of his dreams. <sup>21</sup> And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands; and said, Let us not kill him. <sup>22</sup> And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, but cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that he might rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father again. <a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139" role="doc-noteref"><sup>139</sup></a></p>

<p><sup>1</sup> And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the Ishmeelites, which had brought him down thither. <sup>2</sup> And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian. <sup>3</sup> And his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the LORD made all that he did to prosper in his hand. <sup>4</sup> And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand. <sup>5</sup> And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD blessed the Egyptian’s house for Joseph’s sake; and the blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had in the house, and in the field. <sup>6</sup> And he left all that he had in Joseph’s hand; and he knew not ought he had, save the bread which he did eat.

<p><sup>7</sup> And it came to pass after these things, that his master’s wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me. <sup>8</sup> But he refused, and said unto his master’s wife, Behold, my master wotteth not what is with me in the house, and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand; <sup>9</sup> There is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God? <sup>10</sup> And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her. <sup>11</sup> And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the house to do his business; and there was none of the men of the house there within. <sup>12</sup> And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.</p>

So Pharaoh awoke. <sup>5</sup> And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.^*^ <sup>6</sup> And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them. <sup>7</sup> And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream. <sup>8</sup> And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh. <a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149" role="doc-noteref"><sup>149</sup></a></p>

<p><sup>25</sup> And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God hath shewed Pharaoh what he is about to do. <sup>26</sup> The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years: the dream is one. <sup>27</sup> And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them are seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine. <sup>28</sup> This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God is about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh. <sup>29</sup> Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt: <sup>30</sup> And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land; <sup>31</sup> And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it shall be very grievous.^*^ <sup>32</sup> And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.+ 41.32 established…: or, prepared of God <a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152" role="doc-noteref"><sup>152</sup></a></p>
<p><sup>33</sup> Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt. <sup>34</sup> Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years.^*^ <sup>35</sup> And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities. <sup>36</sup> And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine.+ 41.36 perish…: Heb. be not cut off <a href="#fn153" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref153" role="doc-noteref"><sup>153</sup></a></p>
<p><sup>37</sup> And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants. <sup>38</sup> And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is? <sup>39</sup> And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou art: <sup>40</sup> Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou.^*^ <sup>41</sup> And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt. <sup>42</sup> And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph’s hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck;+ 41.42 fine…: or, silk <sup>43</sup> And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him ruler over all the land of Egypt.+ 41.43 Bow…: or, Tender father: Heb. Abrech <sup>44</sup> And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt. <sup>45</sup> And Pharaoh called Joseph’s name Zaphnath-paaneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah priest of On. And Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt.+ 41.45 Zaphnath-paaneah: which in the Coptic signifies, A revealer of secrets, or, The man to whom secrets are revealed+ 41.45 priest: or, prince <a href="#fn154" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref154" role="doc-noteref"><sup>154</sup></a></p>
<p><sup>46</sup> And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt. <sup>47</sup> And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls. <sup>48</sup> And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the same. <sup>49</sup> And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left numbering; for it was without number. <sup>50</sup> And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, which Asenath the daughter of Poti-pherah priest of On bare unto him.^*^ <sup>51</sup> And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God, said he, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father’s house.+ 41.51 Manasseh: that is, Forgetting <sup>52</sup> And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.+ 41.52 Ephraim: that is, Fruitful <a href="#fn155" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref155" role="doc-noteref"><sup>155</sup></a></p>
<p><sup>53</sup> And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of Egypt, were ended. <sup>54</sup> And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph had said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread. <sup>55</sup> And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do. <sup>56</sup> And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt.^*^ <sup>57</sup> And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn; because that the famine was so sore in all lands. <a href="#fn156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref156" role="doc-noteref"><sup>156</sup></a></p>
<h1 id="section-41">42</h1>
<p><sup>1</sup> Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said unto his sons, Why do ye look one upon another? <sup>2</sup> And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt: get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup> And Joseph’s ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt. <sup>4</sup> But Benjamin, Joseph’s brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him. <sup>5</sup> And the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that came: for the famine was in the land of Canaan. <sup>6</sup> And Joseph was the governor over the land, and he it was that sold to all the people of the land: and Joseph’s brethren came, and bowed down themselves before him with their faces to the earth.</p>
<p><sup>7</sup> And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he said unto them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.^*^ <sup>8</sup> And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him. <sup>9</sup> And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come. <sup>10</sup> And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come. <sup>11</sup> We are all one man’s sons; we are true men, thy servants are no spies. <sup>12</sup> And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come. <sup>13</sup> And they said, Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not. <sup>14</sup> And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you, saying, Ye are spies: <sup>15</sup> Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither. <sup>16</sup> Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether there be any truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies.+ 42.16 kept…: Heb. bound <sup>17</sup> And he put them all together into ward three days.+ 42.17 put: Heb. gathered <sup>18</sup> And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; for I fear God: <sup>19</sup> If ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your houses: <sup>20</sup> But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so. <a href="#fn157" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref157" role="doc-noteref"><sup>157</sup></a></p>
<p><sup>21</sup> And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us. <sup>22</sup> And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore, behold, also his blood is required. <sup>23</sup> And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for he spake unto them by an interpreter.^*^ <sup>24</sup> And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes. <a href="#fn158" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref158" role="doc-noteref"><sup>158</sup></a></p>
<p><sup>25</sup> Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to restore every man’s money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way: and thus did he unto them. <sup>26</sup> And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence. <sup>27</sup> And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it was in his sack’s mouth. <sup>28</sup> And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they were afraid, saying one to another, What is this that God hath done unto us?^*^ <a href="#fn159" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref159" role="doc-noteref"><sup>159</sup></a></p>
<p><sup>29</sup> And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and told him all that befell unto them; saying, <sup>30</sup> The man, who is the lord of the land, spake roughly to us, and took us for spies of the country.^*^ <sup>31</sup> And we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies: <sup>32</sup> We be twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan. <sup>33</sup> And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye are true men; leave one of your brethren here with me, and take food for the famine of your households, and be gone: <sup>34</sup> And bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that ye are no spies, but that ye are true men: so will I deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffick in the land. <a href="#fn160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref160" role="doc-noteref"><sup>160</sup></a></p>
<p><sup>35</sup> And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man’s bundle of money was in his sack: and when both they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid. <sup>36</sup> And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of my children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin away: all these things are against me. <sup>37</sup> And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again. <sup>38</sup> And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.</p>
<h1 id="section-42">43</h1>
<p><sup>1</sup> And the famine was sore in the land. <sup>2</sup> And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy us a little food. <sup>3</sup> And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.^*^ <sup>4</sup> If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food: <sup>5</sup> But if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down: for the man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you. <sup>6</sup> And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother? <sup>7</sup> And they said, The man asked us straitly of our state, and of our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have ye another brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these words: could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your brother down?+ 43.7 asked…: Heb. asking asked us+ 43.7 tenor: Heb. mouth+ 43.7 could…: Heb. knowing could we know <sup>8</sup> And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, and also our little ones. <sup>9</sup> I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever: <sup>10</sup> For except we had lingered, surely now we had returned this second time.+ 43.10 this: or, twice by this <a href="#fn161" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref161" role="doc-noteref"><sup>161</sup></a></p>
<p><sup>11</sup> And their father Israel said unto them, If it must be so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds: <sup>12</sup> And take double money in your hand; and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry it again in your hand; peradventure it was an oversight: <sup>13</sup> Take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man: <sup>14</sup> And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send away your other brother, and Benjamin.

<p><sup>26</sup> And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth. <sup>27</sup> And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father well, the old man of whom ye spake?

And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son. <sup>30</sup> And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his brother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept there. <sup>31</sup> And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread. <sup>32</sup> And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians. <sup>33</sup> And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marvelled one at another. <sup>34</sup> And he took and sent messes unto them from before him: but Benjamin’s mess was five times so much as any of theirs.

<p><sup>1</sup> And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men’s sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man’s money in his sack’s mouth.^*^ <sup>2</sup> And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack’s mouth of the youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken. <sup>3</sup> As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses. <sup>4</sup> And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good? <sup>5</sup> Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.+ 44.5 divineth: or, maketh trial? <a href="#fn165" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref165" role="doc-noteref"><sup>165</sup></a></p>

God forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing: <sup>8</sup> Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks’ mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord’s house silver or gold? <sup>9</sup> With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord’s bondmen. <sup>10</sup> And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he with whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless. <sup>11</sup> Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack. <sup>12</sup> And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack. <sup>13</sup> Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city.</p>
<p><sup>14</sup> And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph’s house; for he was yet there: and they fell before him on the ground. <sup>15</sup> And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done? wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?^*^ <sup>16</sup> And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves?
