<p><sup class='bibleverse'>9</sup> Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day: <sup class='bibleverse'>10</sup> Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the captain of the guard’s house, both me and the chief baker: <sup class='bibleverse'>11</sup> And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream. <sup class='bibleverse'>12</sup> And there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret. <sup class='bibleverse'>13</sup> And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.</p>
