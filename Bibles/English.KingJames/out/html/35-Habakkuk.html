<p><sup class='bibleverse'>1</sup> The burden which Habakkuk the prophet did see. <sup class='bibleverse'>2</sup> O LORD, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear! even cry out unto thee of violence, and thou wilt not save! <sup class='bibleverse'>3</sup> Why dost thou shew me iniquity, and cause me to behold grievance? for spoiling and violence are before me: and there are that raise up strife and contention. <sup class='bibleverse'>4</sup> Therefore the law is slacked, and judgment doth never go forth: for the wicked doth compass about the righteous; therefore wrong judgment proceedeth.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>5</sup> Behold ye among the heathen, and regard, and wonder marvellously: for I will work a work in your days, which ye will not believe, though it be told you. <sup class='bibleverse'>6</sup> For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation, which shall march through the breadth of the land, to possess the dwellingplaces that are not theirs.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>7</sup> They are terrible and dreadful: their judgment and their dignity shall proceed of themselves.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>8</sup> Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves: and their horsemen shall spread themselves, and their horsemen shall come from far; they shall fly as the eagle that hasteth to eat.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>9</sup> They shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup up as the east wind, and they shall gather the captivity as the sand.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>10</sup> And they shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be a scorn unto them: they shall deride every strong hold; for they shall heap dust, and take it. <sup class='bibleverse'>11</sup> Then shall his mind change, and he shall pass over, and offend, imputing this his power unto his god.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>12</sup> Art thou not from everlasting, O LORD my God, mine Holy One? we shall not die.

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>18</sup> What profiteth the graven image that the maker thereof hath graven it; the molten image, and a teacher of lies, that the maker of his work trusteth therein, to make dumb idols?<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>19</sup> Woe unto him that saith to the wood, Awake; to the dumb stone, Arise, it shall teach!

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>1</sup> A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet upon Shigionoth.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>2</sup> O LORD, I have heard thy speech, and was afraid: O LORD, revive thy work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the years make known; in wrath remember mercy.<sup>[<strong>3:2</strong> speech: Heb. report, or, hearing]</sup>[<strong>3:2</strong> revive: or, preserve alive]</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>3</sup> God came from Teman, and the Holy One from mount Paran. Selah.
