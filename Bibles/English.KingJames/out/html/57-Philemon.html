<p><sup class='bibleverse'>1</sup> Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer, <sup class='bibleverse'>2</sup> And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house: <sup class='bibleverse'>3</sup> Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>4</sup> I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers, <sup class='bibleverse'>5</sup> Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints; <sup class='bibleverse'>6</sup> That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus. <sup class='bibleverse'>7</sup> For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother. <sup class='bibleverse'>8</sup> Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient, <sup class='bibleverse'>9</sup> Yet for loveâ€™s sake I rather beseech thee, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ. <sup class='bibleverse'>10</sup> I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds: <sup class='bibleverse'>11</sup> Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me: <sup class='bibleverse'>12</sup> Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels: <sup class='bibleverse'>13</sup> Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel: <sup class='bibleverse'>14</sup> But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly. <sup class='bibleverse'>15</sup> For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever; <sup class='bibleverse'>16</sup> Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord? <sup class='bibleverse'>17</sup> If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself. <sup class='bibleverse'>18</sup> If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine account; <sup class='bibleverse'>19</sup> I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides. <sup class='bibleverse'>20</sup> Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>21</sup> Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say. <sup class='bibleverse'>22</sup> But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>23</sup> There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus; <sup class='bibleverse'>24</sup> Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers. <sup class='bibleverse'>25</sup> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen. ## Written from Rome to Philemon, by Onesimus, a servant.</p>
