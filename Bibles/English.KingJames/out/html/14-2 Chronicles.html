<p><sup class='bibleverse'>1</sup> And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and the LORD his God was with him, and magnified him exceedingly. <sup class='bibleverse'>2</sup> Then Solomon spake unto all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every governor in all Israel, the chief of the fathers. <sup class='bibleverse'>3</sup> So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for there was the tabernacle of the congregation of God, which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness. <sup class='bibleverse'>4</sup> But the ark of God had David brought up from Kirjath-jearim to the place which David had prepared for it: for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem. <sup class='bibleverse'>5</sup> Moreover the brasen altar, that Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, he put before the tabernacle of the LORD: and Solomon and the congregation sought unto it.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>6</sup> And Solomon went up thither to the brasen altar before the LORD, which was at the tabernacle of the congregation, and offered a thousand burnt offerings upon it.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>7</sup> In that night did God appear unto Solomon, and said unto him, Ask what I shall give thee. <sup class='bibleverse'>8</sup> And Solomon said unto God, Thou hast shewed great mercy unto David my father, and hast made me to reign in his stead. <sup class='bibleverse'>9</sup> Now, O LORD God, let thy promise unto David my father be established: for thou hast made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>10</sup> Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people: for who can judge this thy people, that is so great? <sup class='bibleverse'>11</sup> And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thine heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honour, nor the life of thine enemies, neither yet hast asked long life; but hast asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself, that thou mayest judge my people, over whom I have made thee king: <sup class='bibleverse'>12</sup> Wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee; and I will give thee riches, and wealth, and honour, such as none of the kings have had that have been before thee, neither shall there any after thee have the like.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>13</sup> Then Solomon came from his journey to the high place that was at Gibeon to Jerusalem, from before the tabernacle of the congregation, and reigned over Israel. <sup class='bibleverse'>14</sup> And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, which he placed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem. <sup class='bibleverse'>15</sup> And the king made silver and gold at Jerusalem as plenteous as stones, and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that are in the vale for abundance.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>16</sup> And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king’s merchants received the linen yarn at a price.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>17</sup> And they fetched up, and brought forth out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred shekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so brought they out horses for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, by their means.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<h1 id="section-1">2</h1>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>1</sup> And Solomon determined to build an house for the name of the LORD, and an house for his kingdom. <sup class='bibleverse'>2</sup> And Solomon told out threescore and ten thousand men to bear burdens, and fourscore thousand to hew in the mountain, and three thousand and six hundred to oversee them.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>3</sup> And Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, As thou didst deal with David my father, and didst send him cedars to build him an house to dwell therein, even so deal with me.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>4</sup> Behold, I build an house to the name of the LORD my God, to dedicate it to him, and to burn before him sweet incense, and for the continual shewbread, and for the burnt offerings morning and evening, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn feasts of the LORD our God.

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>11</sup> Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon, Because the LORD hath loved his people, he hath made thee king over them. <sup class='bibleverse'>12</sup> Huram said moreover, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, that made heaven and earth, who hath given to David the king a wise son, endued with prudence and understanding, that might build an house for the LORD, and an house for his kingdom.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>13</sup> And now I have sent a cunning man, endued with understanding, of Huram my father’s, <sup class='bibleverse'>14</sup> The son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father was a man of Tyre, skilful to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue, and in fine linen, and in crimson; also to grave any manner of graving, and to find out every device which shall be put to him, with thy cunning men, and with the cunning men of my lord David thy father. <sup class='bibleverse'>15</sup> Now therefore the wheat, and the barley, the oil, and the wine, which my lord hath spoken of, let him send unto his servants: <sup class='bibleverse'>16</sup> And we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as thou shalt need: and we will bring it to thee in floats by sea to Joppa; and thou shalt carry it up to Jerusalem.<sup>[<strong>2:16</strong> as much…: Heb according to all thy need]</sup>[<strong>2:16</strong> Joppa: Heb.

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>17</sup> And Solomon numbered all the strangers that were in the land of Israel, after the numbering wherewith David his father had numbered them; and they were found an hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>18</sup> And he set threescore and ten thousand of them to be bearers of burdens, and fourscore thousand to be hewers in the mountain, and three thousand and six hundred overseers to set the people a work.</p>
<h1 id="section-2">3</h1>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>1</sup> Then Solomon began to build the house of the LORD at Jerusalem in mount Moriah, where the Lord appeared unto David his father, in the place that David had prepared in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.<sup>[<strong>3:1</strong> where…: or, which was seen of David his father]</sup>[<strong>3:1</strong> Ornan: also called, Araunah] <sup class='bibleverse'>2</sup> And he began to build in the second day of the second month, in the fourth year of his reign.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>3</sup> Now these are the things wherein Solomon was instructed for the building of the house of God.

And he overlaid the upper chambers with gold.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>10</sup> And in the most holy house he made two cherubims of image work, and overlaid them with gold.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>11</sup> And the wings of the cherubims were twenty cubits long: one wing of the one cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house: and the other wing was likewise five cubits, reaching to the wing of the other cherub. <sup class='bibleverse'>12</sup> And one wing of the other cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house: and the other wing was five cubits also, joining to the wing of the other cherub. <sup class='bibleverse'>13</sup> The wings of these cherubims spread themselves forth twenty cubits: and they stood on their feet, and their faces were inward.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>14</sup> And he made the vail of blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine linen, and wrought cherubims thereon.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>15</sup> Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five cubits high, and the chapiter that was on the top of each of them was five cubits.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>16</sup> And he made chains, as in the oracle, and put them on the heads of the pillars; and made an hundred pomegranates, and put them on the chains. <sup class='bibleverse'>17</sup> And he reared up the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz.<sup>[<strong>3:17</strong> Jachin: that is, He shall establish]</sup>[<strong>3:17</strong> Boaz: that is, In it is strength]</p>
<h1 id="section-3">4</h1>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>1</sup> Moreover he made an altar of brass, twenty cubits the length thereof, and twenty cubits the breadth thereof, and ten cubits the height thereof.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>2</sup> Also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass, and five cubits the height thereof; and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>3</sup> And under it was the similitude of oxen, which did compass it round about: ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about.

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>6</sup> He made also ten lavers, and put five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them: such things as they offered for the burnt offering they washed in them; but the sea was for the priests to wash in.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>7</sup> And he made ten candlesticks of gold according to their form, and set them in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left. <sup class='bibleverse'>8</sup> He made also ten tables, and placed them in the temple, five on the right side, and five on the left.

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>9</sup> Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great court, and doors for the court, and overlaid the doors of them with brass. <sup class='bibleverse'>10</sup> And he set the sea on the right side of the east end, over against the south.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>11</sup> And Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basons.

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>19</sup> And Solomon made all the vessels that were for the house of God, the golden altar also, and the tables whereon the shewbread was set; <sup class='bibleverse'>20</sup> Moreover the candlesticks with their lamps, that they should burn after the manner before the oracle, of pure gold; <sup class='bibleverse'>21</sup> And the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, made he of gold, and that perfect gold;<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>22</sup> And the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the censers, of pure gold: and the entry of the house, the inner doors thereof for the most holy place, and the doors of the house of the temple, were of gold.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29" role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a></p>

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>1</sup> Thus all the work that Solomon made for the house of the LORD was finished: and Solomon brought in all the things that David his father had dedicated; and the silver, and the gold, and all the instruments, put he among the treasures of the house of God.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>2</sup> Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which is Zion. <sup class='bibleverse'>3</sup> Wherefore all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto the king in the feast which was in the seventh month. <sup class='bibleverse'>4</sup> And all the elders of Israel came; and the Levites took up the ark. <sup class='bibleverse'>5</sup> And they brought up the ark, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle, these did the priests and the Levites bring up. <sup class='bibleverse'>6</sup> Also king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel that were assembled unto him before the ark, sacrificed sheep and oxen, which could not be told nor numbered for multitude. <sup class='bibleverse'>7</sup> And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD unto his place, to the oracle of the house, into the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubims: <sup class='bibleverse'>8</sup> For the cherubims spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above. <sup class='bibleverse'>9</sup> And they drew out the staves of the ark, that the ends of the staves were seen from the ark before the oracle; but they were not seen without.

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>11</sup> And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place: (for all the priests that were present were sanctified, and did not then wait by course:<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>12</sup> Also the Levites which were the singers, all of them of Asaph, of Heman, of Jeduthun, with their sons and their brethren, being arrayed in white linen, having cymbals and psalteries and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them an hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets:) <sup class='bibleverse'>13</sup> It came even to pass, as the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the LORD; and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of musick, and praised the LORD, saying, For he is good; for his mercy endureth for ever: that then the house was filled with a cloud, even the house of the LORD; <sup class='bibleverse'>14</sup> So that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of God.</p>

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>1</sup> Then said Solomon, The LORD hath said that he would dwell in the thick darkness. <sup class='bibleverse'>2</sup> But I have built an house of habitation for thee, and a place for thy dwelling for ever. <sup class='bibleverse'>3</sup> And the king turned his face, and blessed the whole congregation of Israel: and all the congregation of Israel stood. <sup class='bibleverse'>4</sup> And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, who hath with his hands fulfilled that which he spake with his mouth to my father David, saying, <sup class='bibleverse'>5</sup> Since the day that I brought forth my people out of the land of Egypt I chose no city among all the tribes of Israel to build an house in, that my name might be there; neither chose I any man to be a ruler over my people Israel: <sup class='bibleverse'>6</sup> But I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name might be there; and have chosen David to be over my people Israel. <sup class='bibleverse'>7</sup> Now it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel. <sup class='bibleverse'>8</sup> But the LORD said to David my father, Forasmuch as it was in thine heart to build an house for my name, thou didst well in that it was in thine heart: <sup class='bibleverse'>9</sup> Notwithstanding thou shalt not build the house; but thy son which shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house for my name. <sup class='bibleverse'>10</sup> The LORD therefore hath performed his word that he hath spoken: for I am risen up in the room of David my father, and am set on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built the house for the name of the LORD God of Israel. <sup class='bibleverse'>11</sup> And in it have I put the ark, wherein is the covenant of the LORD, that he made with the children of Israel.</p>

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>12</sup> So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, as the king bade, saying, Come again to me on the third day. <sup class='bibleverse'>13</sup> And the king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old men, <sup class='bibleverse'>14</sup> And answered them after the advice of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add thereto: my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions. <sup class='bibleverse'>15</sup> So the king hearkened not unto the people: for the cause was of God, that the LORD might perform his word, which he spake by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.</p>

<h1 id="section-11">12</h1>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>1</sup> And it came to pass, when Rehoboam had established the kingdom, and had strengthened himself, he forsook the law of the LORD, and all Israel with him. <sup class='bibleverse'>2</sup> And it came to pass, that in the fifth year of king Rehoboam Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had transgressed against the LORD, <sup class='bibleverse'>3</sup> With twelve hundred chariots, and threescore thousand horsemen: and the people were without number that came with him out of Egypt; the Lubims, the Sukkiims, and the Ethiopians. <sup class='bibleverse'>4</sup> And he took the fenced cities which pertained to Judah, and came to Jerusalem.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>5</sup> Then came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam, and to the princes of Judah, that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said unto them, Thus saith the LORD, Ye have forsaken me, and therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak. <sup class='bibleverse'>6</sup> Whereupon the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said, The LORD is righteous. <sup class='bibleverse'>7</sup> And when the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled themselves; therefore I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some deliverance; and my wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69" role="doc-noteref"><sup>69</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>8</sup> Nevertheless they shall be his servants; that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries. <sup class='bibleverse'>9</sup> So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king’s house; he took all: he carried away also the shields of gold which Solomon had made. <sup class='bibleverse'>10</sup> Instead of which king Rehoboam made shields of brass, and committed them to the hands of the chief of the guard, that kept the entrance of the king’s house. <sup class='bibleverse'>11</sup> And when the king entered into the house of the LORD, the guard came and fetched them, and brought them again into the guard chamber. <sup class='bibleverse'>12</sup> And when he humbled himself, the wrath of the LORD turned from him, that he would not destroy him altogether: and also in Judah things went well.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70" role="doc-noteref"><sup>70</sup></a></p>

And his mother’s name was Naamah an Ammonitess. <sup class='bibleverse'>14</sup> And he did evil, because he prepared not his heart to seek the LORD.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71" role="doc-noteref"><sup>71</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>15</sup> Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written in the book of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer concerning genealogies?

<h1 id="section-12">13</h1>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>1</sup> Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to reign over Judah. <sup class='bibleverse'>2</sup> He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name also was Michaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah.

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>4</sup> And Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim, which is in mount Ephraim, and said, Hear me, thou Jeroboam, and all Israel; <sup class='bibleverse'>5</sup> Ought ye not to know that the LORD God of Israel gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever, even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt? <sup class='bibleverse'>6</sup> Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, is risen up, and hath rebelled against his lord. <sup class='bibleverse'>7</sup> And there are gathered unto him vain men, the children of Belial, and have strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tenderhearted, and could not withstand them. <sup class='bibleverse'>8</sup> And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the LORD in the hand of the sons of David; and ye be a great multitude, and there are with you golden calves, which Jeroboam made you for gods. <sup class='bibleverse'>9</sup> Have ye not cast out the priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and have made you priests after the manner of the nations of other lands? so that whosoever cometh to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams, the same may be a priest of them that are no gods.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75" role="doc-noteref"><sup>75</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>10</sup> But as for us, the LORD is our God, and we have not forsaken him; and the priests, which minister unto the LORD, are the sons of Aaron, and the Levites wait upon their business: <sup class='bibleverse'>11</sup> And they burn unto the LORD every morning and every evening burnt sacrifices and sweet incense: the shewbread also set they in order upon the pure table; and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof, to burn every evening: for we keep the charge of the LORD our God; but ye have forsaken him. <sup class='bibleverse'>12</sup> And, behold, God himself is with us for our captain, and his priests with sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you. O children of Israel, fight ye not against the LORD God of your fathers; for ye shall not prosper.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>13</sup> But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them: so they were before Judah, and the ambushment was behind them. <sup class='bibleverse'>14</sup> And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle was before and behind: and they cried unto the LORD, and the priests sounded with the trumpets. <sup class='bibleverse'>15</sup> Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah shouted, it came to pass, that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah. <sup class='bibleverse'>16</sup> And the children of Israel fled before Judah: and God delivered them into their hand. <sup class='bibleverse'>17</sup> And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter: so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men. <sup class='bibleverse'>18</sup> Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon the LORD God of their fathers. <sup class='bibleverse'>19</sup> And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Beth-el with the towns thereof, and Jeshanah with the towns thereof, and Ephrain with the towns thereof. <sup class='bibleverse'>20</sup> Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah: and the LORD struck him, and he died.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>21</sup> But Abijah waxed mighty, and married fourteen wives, and begat twenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters. <sup class='bibleverse'>22</sup> And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his sayings, are written in the story of the prophet Iddo.</p>
<h1 id="section-13">14</h1>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>1</sup> So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land was quiet ten years. <sup class='bibleverse'>2</sup> And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God: <sup class='bibleverse'>3</sup> For he took away the altars of the strange gods, and the high places, and brake down the images, and cut down the groves:<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76" role="doc-noteref"><sup>76</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>4</sup> And commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment. <sup class='bibleverse'>5</sup> Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him.<a href="#fn77" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref77" role="doc-noteref"><sup>77</sup></a></p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>6</sup> And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years; because the LORD had given him rest. <sup class='bibleverse'>7</sup> Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars, while the land is yet before us; because we have sought the LORD our God, we have sought him, and he hath given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered. <sup class='bibleverse'>8</sup> And Asa had an army of men that bare targets and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these were mighty men of valour.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>9</sup> And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came unto Mareshah. <sup class='bibleverse'>10</sup> Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah. <sup class='bibleverse'>11</sup> And Asa cried unto the LORD his God, and said, LORD, it is nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power: help us, O LORD our God; for we rest on thee, and in thy name we go against this multitude.

<h1 id="section-14">15</h1>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>1</sup> And the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded: <sup class='bibleverse'>2</sup> And he went out to meet Asa, and said unto him, Hear ye me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin; The LORD is with you, while ye be with him; and if ye seek him, he will be found of you; but if ye forsake him, he will forsake you.<a href="#fn80" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref80" role="doc-noteref"><sup>80</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>3</sup> Now for a long season Israel hath been without the true God, and without a teaching priest, and without law. <sup class='bibleverse'>4</sup> But when they in their trouble did turn unto the LORD God of Israel, and sought him, he was found of them. <sup class='bibleverse'>5</sup> And in those times there was no peace to him that went out, nor to him that came in, but great vexations were upon all the inhabitants of the countries. <sup class='bibleverse'>6</sup> And nation was destroyed of nation, and city of city: for God did vex them with all adversity.<a href="#fn81" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref81" role="doc-noteref"><sup>81</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>7</sup> Be ye strong therefore, and let not your hands be weak: for your work shall be rewarded.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>8</sup> And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominable idols out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had taken from mount Ephraim, and renewed the altar of the LORD, that was before the porch of the LORD.<a href="#fn82" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref82" role="doc-noteref"><sup>82</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>9</sup> And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that the LORD his God was with him. <sup class='bibleverse'>10</sup> So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa. <sup class='bibleverse'>11</sup> And they offered unto the LORD the same time, of the spoil which they had brought, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep.<a href="#fn83" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref83" role="doc-noteref"><sup>83</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>12</sup> And they entered into a covenant to seek the LORD God of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul; <sup class='bibleverse'>13</sup> That whosoever would not seek the LORD God of Israel should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman. <sup class='bibleverse'>14</sup> And they sware unto the LORD with a loud voice, and with shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets. <sup class='bibleverse'>15</sup> And all Judah rejoiced at the oath: for they had sworn with all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found of them: and the LORD gave them rest round about.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>16</sup> And also concerning Maachah the mother of Asa the king, he removed her from being queen, because she had made an idol in a grove: and Asa cut down her idol, and stamped it, and burnt it at the brook Kidron.<sup>[<strong>15:16</strong> mother: that is, grandmother]</sup>[<strong>15:16</strong> idol: Heb. horror] <sup class='bibleverse'>17</sup> But the high places were not taken away out of Israel: nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>18</sup> And he brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and vessels. <sup class='bibleverse'>19</sup> And there was no more war unto the five and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa.</p>
<h1 id="section-15">16</h1>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>1</sup> In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah, and built Ramah, to the intent that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah. <sup class='bibleverse'>2</sup> Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of the LORD and of the king’s house, and sent to Ben-hadad king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying,<a href="#fn84" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref84" role="doc-noteref"><sup>84</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>3</sup> There is a league between me and thee, as there was between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent thee silver and gold; go, break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me. <sup class='bibleverse'>4</sup> And Ben-hadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel; and they smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abel-maim, and all the store cities of Naphtali.<a href="#fn85" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref85" role="doc-noteref"><sup>85</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>5</sup> And it came to pass, when Baasha heard it, that he left off building of Ramah, and let his work cease. <sup class='bibleverse'>6</sup> Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha was building; and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>7</sup> And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said unto him, Because thou hast relied on the king of Syria, and not relied on the LORD thy God, therefore is the host of the king of Syria escaped out of thine hand. <sup class='bibleverse'>8</sup> Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubims a huge host, with very many chariots and horsemen? yet, because thou didst rely on the LORD, he delivered them into thine hand.<a href="#fn86" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref86" role="doc-noteref"><sup>86</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>9</sup> For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him.

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>11</sup> And, behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, lo, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. <sup class='bibleverse'>12</sup> And Asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased in his feet, until his disease was exceeding great: yet in his disease he sought not to the LORD, but to the physicians.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>13</sup> And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and fortieth year of his reign. <sup class='bibleverse'>14</sup> And they buried him in his own sepulchres, which he had made for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odours and divers kinds of spices prepared by the apothecaries’ art: and they made a very great burning for him.<a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89" role="doc-noteref"><sup>89</sup></a></p>

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>1</sup> And Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead, and strengthened himself against Israel. <sup class='bibleverse'>2</sup> And he placed forces in all the fenced cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken. <sup class='bibleverse'>3</sup> And the LORD was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the first ways of his father David, and sought not unto Baalim;<a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90" role="doc-noteref"><sup>90</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>4</sup> But sought to the Lord God of his father, and walked in his commandments, and not after the doings of Israel. <sup class='bibleverse'>5</sup> Therefore the LORD stablished the kingdom in his hand; and all Judah brought to Jehoshaphat presents; and he had riches and honour in abundance.<a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91" role="doc-noteref"><sup>91</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>6</sup> And his heart was lifted up in the ways of the LORD: moreover he took away the high places and groves out of Judah.<a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92" role="doc-noteref"><sup>92</sup></a></p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>7</sup> Also in the third year of his reign he sent to his princes, even to Ben-hail, and to Obadiah, and to Zechariah, and to Nethaneel, and to Michaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah. <sup class='bibleverse'>8</sup> And with them he sent Levites, even Shemaiah, and Nethaniah, and Zebadiah, and Asahel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehonathan, and Adonijah, and Tobijah, and Tob-adonijah, Levites; and with them Elishama and Jehoram, priests. <sup class='bibleverse'>9</sup> And they taught in Judah, and had the book of the law of the LORD with them, and went about throughout all the cities of Judah, and taught the people.</p>

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>14</sup> Then upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite of the sons of Asaph, came the Spirit of the LORD in the midst of the congregation; <sup class='bibleverse'>15</sup> And he said, Hearken ye, all Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, and thou king Jehoshaphat, Thus saith the LORD unto you, Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the battle is not yours, but God’s. <sup class='bibleverse'>16</sup> To morrow go ye down against them: behold, they come up by the cliff of Ziz; and ye shall find them at the end of the brook, before the wilderness of Jeruel.<sup>[<strong>20:16</strong> cliff: Heb. ascent]</sup>[<strong>20:16</strong> brook: or, valley] <sup class='bibleverse'>17</sup> Ye shall not need to fight in this battle: set yourselves, stand ye still, and see the salvation of the LORD with you, O Judah and Jerusalem: fear not, nor be dismayed; to morrow go out against them: for the LORD will be with you. <sup class='bibleverse'>18</sup> And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before the LORD, worshipping the LORD. <sup class='bibleverse'>19</sup> And the Levites, of the children of the Kohathites, and of the children of the Korhites, stood up to praise the LORD God of Israel with a loud voice on high.</p>

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>26</sup> And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Berachah; for there they blessed the LORD: therefore the name of the same place was called, The valley of Berachah, unto this day.<a href="#fn114" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref114" role="doc-noteref"><sup>114</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>27</sup> Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and Jehoshaphat in the forefront of them, to go again to Jerusalem with joy; for the LORD had made them to rejoice over their enemies.<a href="#fn115" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref115" role="doc-noteref"><sup>115</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>28</sup> And they came to Jerusalem with psalteries and harps and trumpets unto the house of the LORD. <sup class='bibleverse'>29</sup> And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of those countries, when they had heard that the LORD fought against the enemies of Israel. <sup class='bibleverse'>30</sup> So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet: for his God gave him rest round about.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>31</sup> And Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah: he was thirty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem.

<h1 id="section-20">21</h1>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>1</sup> Now Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David.

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>5</sup> Jehoram was thirty and two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem. <sup class='bibleverse'>6</sup> And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, like as did the house of Ahab: for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife: and he wrought that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD. <sup class='bibleverse'>7</sup> Howbeit the LORD would not destroy the house of David, because of the covenant that he had made with David, and as he promised to give a light to him and to his sons for ever.<a href="#fn116" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref116" role="doc-noteref"><sup>116</sup></a></p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>8</sup> In his days the Edomites revolted from under the dominion of Judah, and made themselves a king.<a href="#fn117" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref117" role="doc-noteref"><sup>117</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>9</sup> Then Jehoram went forth with his princes, and all his chariots with him: and he rose up by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him in, and the captains of the chariots. <sup class='bibleverse'>10</sup> So the Edomites revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day. The same time also did Libnah revolt from under his hand; because he had forsaken the LORD God of his fathers. <sup class='bibleverse'>11</sup> Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah, and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit fornication, and compelled Judah thereto.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>12</sup> And there came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet, saying, Thus saith the LORD God of David thy father, Because thou hast not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat thy father, nor in the ways of Asa king of Judah, <sup class='bibleverse'>13</sup> But hast walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and hast made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to go a whoring, like to the whoredoms of the house of Ahab, and also hast slain thy brethren of thy father’s house, which were better than thyself: <sup class='bibleverse'>14</sup> Behold, with a great plague will the LORD smite thy people, and thy children, and thy wives, and all thy goods:<a href="#fn118" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref118" role="doc-noteref"><sup>118</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>15</sup> And thou shalt have great sickness by disease of thy bowels, until thy bowels fall out by reason of the sickness day by day.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>16</sup> Moreover the LORD stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines, and of the Arabians, that were near the Ethiopians: <sup class='bibleverse'>17</sup> And they came up into Judah, and brake into it, and carried away all the substance that was found in the king’s house, and his sons also, and his wives; so that there was never a son left him, save Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons.<sup>[<strong>21:17</strong> carried…: Heb. carried captive]</sup>[<strong>21:17</strong> Jehoahaz: also called, Ahaziah, or, Azariah]</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>18</sup> And after all this the LORD smote him in his bowels with an incurable disease. <sup class='bibleverse'>19</sup> And it came to pass, that in process of time, after the end of two years, his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness: so he died of sore diseases. And his people made no burning for him, like the burning of his fathers. <sup class='bibleverse'>20</sup> Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years, and departed without being desired. Howbeit they buried him in the city of David, but not in the sepulchres of the kings.<a href="#fn119" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref119" role="doc-noteref"><sup>119</sup></a></p>
<h1 id="section-21">22</h1>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>1</sup> And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king in his stead: for the band of men that came with the Arabians to the camp had slain all the eldest. So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned. <sup class='bibleverse'>2</sup> Forty and two years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother’s name also was Athaliah the daughter of Omri. <sup class='bibleverse'>3</sup> He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab: for his mother was his counsellor to do wickedly. <sup class='bibleverse'>4</sup> Wherefore he did evil in the sight of the LORD like the house of Ahab: for they were his counsellors after the death of his father to his destruction.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>5</sup> He walked also after their counsel, and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth-gilead: and the Syrians smote Joram. <sup class='bibleverse'>6</sup> And he returned to be healed in Jezreel because of the wounds which were given him at Ramah, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria. And Azariah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab at Jezreel, because he was sick.<sup>[<strong>22:6</strong> which…: Heb. wherewith they wounded him]</sup>[<strong>22:6</strong> Azariah: also called, Ahaziah, or, Jehoahaz] <sup class='bibleverse'>7</sup> And the destruction of Ahaziah was of God by coming to Joram: for when he was come, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom the LORD had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab.<a href="#fn120" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref120" role="doc-noteref"><sup>120</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>8</sup> And it came to pass, that, when Jehu was executing judgment upon the house of Ahab, and found the princes of Judah, and the sons of the brethren of Ahaziah, that ministered to Ahaziah, he slew them. <sup class='bibleverse'>9</sup> And he sought Ahaziah: and they caught him, (for he was hid in Samaria,) and brought him to Jehu: and when they had slain him, they buried him: Because, said they, he is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought the LORD with all his heart. So the house of Ahaziah had no power to keep still the kingdom.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>10</sup> But when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of Judah. <sup class='bibleverse'>11</sup> But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king’s sons that were slain, and put him and his nurse in a bedchamber. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest, (for she was the sister of Ahaziah,) hid him from Athaliah, so that she slew him not.<a href="#fn121" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref121" role="doc-noteref"><sup>121</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>12</sup> And he was with them hid in the house of God six years: and Athaliah reigned over the land.</p>

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>1</sup> And in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself, and took the captains of hundreds, Azariah the son of Jeroham, and Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, and Azariah the son of Obed, and Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri, into covenant with him. <sup class='bibleverse'>2</sup> And they went about in Judah, and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah, and the chief of the fathers of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem. <sup class='bibleverse'>3</sup> And all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the house of God.

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>12</sup> Now when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king, she came to the people into the house of the LORD: <sup class='bibleverse'>13</sup> And she looked, and, behold, the king stood at his pillar at the entering in, and the princes and the trumpets by the king: and all the people of the land rejoiced, and sounded with trumpets, also the singers with instruments of musick, and such as taught to sing praise.

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>16</sup> And Jehoiada made a covenant between him, and between all the people, and between the king, that they should be the LORD’s people. <sup class='bibleverse'>17</sup> Then all the people went to the house of Baal, and brake it down, and brake his altars and his images in pieces, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. <sup class='bibleverse'>18</sup> Also Jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the LORD by the hand of the priests the Levites, whom David had distributed in the house of the LORD, to offer the burnt offerings of the LORD, as it is written in the law of Moses, with rejoicing and with singing, as it was ordained by David.<a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125" role="doc-noteref"><sup>125</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>19</sup> And he set the porters at the gates of the house of the LORD, that none which was unclean in any thing should enter in. <sup class='bibleverse'>20</sup> And he took the captains of hundreds, and the nobles, and the governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought down the king from the house of the LORD: and they came through the high gate into the king’s house, and set the king upon the throne of the kingdom. <sup class='bibleverse'>21</sup> And all the people of the land rejoiced: and the city was quiet, after that they had slain Athaliah with the sword.</p>

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>1</sup> Joash was seven years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem.

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>4</sup> And it came to pass after this, that Joash was minded to repair the house of the LORD.<a href="#fn126" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref126" role="doc-noteref"><sup>126</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>5</sup> And he gathered together the priests and the Levites, and said to them, Go out unto the cities of Judah, and gather of all Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to year, and see that ye hasten the matter. Howbeit the Levites hastened it not. <sup class='bibleverse'>6</sup> And the king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said unto him, Why hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the collection, according to the commandment of Moses the servant of the LORD, and of the congregation of Israel, for the tabernacle of witness? <sup class='bibleverse'>7</sup> For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up the house of God; and also all the dedicated things of the house of the LORD did they bestow upon Baalim. <sup class='bibleverse'>8</sup> And at the king’s commandment they made a chest, and set it without at the gate of the house of the LORD. <sup class='bibleverse'>9</sup> And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to bring in to the LORD the collection that Moses the servant of God laid upon Israel in the wilderness.<a href="#fn127" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref127" role="doc-noteref"><sup>127</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>10</sup> And all the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought in, and cast into the chest, until they had made an end. <sup class='bibleverse'>11</sup> Now it came to pass, that at what time the chest was brought unto the king’s office by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that there was much money, the king’s scribe and the high priest’s officer came and emptied the chest, and took it, and carried it to his place again. Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance. <sup class='bibleverse'>12</sup> And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and hired masons and carpenters to repair the house of the LORD, and also such as wrought iron and brass to mend the house of the LORD. <sup class='bibleverse'>13</sup> So the workmen wrought, and the work was perfected by them, and they set the house of God in his state, and strengthened it.<a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128" role="doc-noteref"><sup>128</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>14</sup> And when they had finished it, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada, whereof were made vessels for the house of the LORD, even vessels to minister, and to offer withal, and spoons, and vessels of gold and silver.

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>1</sup> Amaziah was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem. <sup class='bibleverse'>2</sup> And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, but not with a perfect heart.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>3</sup> Now it came to pass, when the kingdom was established to him, that he slew his servants that had killed the king his father.<a href="#fn131" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref131" role="doc-noteref"><sup>131</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>4</sup> But he slew not their children, but did as it is written in the law in the book of Moses, where the LORD commanded, saying, The fathers shall not die for the children, neither shall the children die for the fathers, but every man shall die for his own sin.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>5</sup> Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and made them captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, according to the houses of their fathers, throughout all Judah and Benjamin: and he numbered them from twenty years old and above, and found them three hundred thousand choice men, able to go forth to war, that could handle spear and shield. <sup class='bibleverse'>6</sup> He hired also an hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of Israel for an hundred talents of silver. <sup class='bibleverse'>7</sup> But there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not the army of Israel go with thee; for the LORD is not with Israel, to wit, with all the children of Ephraim. <sup class='bibleverse'>8</sup> But if thou wilt go, do it, be strong for the battle: God shall make thee fall before the enemy: for God hath power to help, and to cast down. <sup class='bibleverse'>9</sup> And Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel? And the man of God answered, The LORD is able to give thee much more than this.<a href="#fn132" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref132" role="doc-noteref"><sup>132</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>10</sup> Then Amaziah separated them, to wit, the army that was come to him out of Ephraim, to go home again: wherefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in great anger.<sup>[<strong>25:10</strong> home again: Heb. to their place]</sup>[<strong>25:10</strong> in great…: Heb. in heat of anger]</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>11</sup> And Amaziah strengthened himself, and led forth his people, and went to the valley of salt, and smote of the children of Seir ten thousand. <sup class='bibleverse'>12</sup> And other ten thousand left alive did the children of Judah carry away captive, and brought them unto the top of the rock, and cast them down from the top of the rock, that they all were broken in pieces.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>13</sup> But the soldiers of the army which Amaziah sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, fell upon the cities of Judah, from Samaria even unto Beth-horon, and smote three thousand of them, and took much spoil.<a href="#fn133" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref133" role="doc-noteref"><sup>133</sup></a></p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>14</sup> Now it came to pass, after that Amaziah was come from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children of Seir, and set them up to be his gods, and bowed down himself before them, and burned incense unto them. <sup class='bibleverse'>15</sup> Wherefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against Amaziah, and he sent unto him a prophet, which said unto him, Why hast thou sought after the gods of the people, which could not deliver their own people out of thine hand? <sup class='bibleverse'>16</sup> And it came to pass, as he talked with him, that the king said unto him, Art thou made of the king’s counsel? forbear; why shouldest thou be smitten? Then the prophet forbare, and said, I know that God hath determined to destroy thee, because thou hast done this, and hast not hearkened unto my counsel.<a href="#fn134" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref134" role="doc-noteref"><sup>134</sup></a></p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>17</sup> Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us see one another in the face. <sup class='bibleverse'>18</sup> And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and trode down the thistle.<sup>[<strong>25:18</strong> thistle: or, furze bush, or, thorn]</sup>[<strong>25:18</strong> a wild…: Heb. a beast of the field] <sup class='bibleverse'>19</sup> Thou sayest, Lo, thou hast smitten the Edomites; and thine heart lifteth thee up to boast: abide now at home; why shouldest thou meddle to thine hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even thou, and Judah with thee? <sup class='bibleverse'>20</sup> But Amaziah would not hear; for it came of God, that he might deliver them into the hand of their enemies, because they sought after the gods of Edom. <sup class='bibleverse'>21</sup> So Joash the king of Israel went up; and they saw one another in the face, both he and Amaziah king of Judah, at Beth-shemesh, which belongeth to Judah. <sup class='bibleverse'>22</sup> And Judah was put to the worse before Israel, and they fled every man to his tent.<a href="#fn135" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref135" role="doc-noteref"><sup>135</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>23</sup> And Joash the king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, at Beth-shemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.<a href="#fn136" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref136" role="doc-noteref"><sup>136</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>24</sup> And he took all the gold and the silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of God with Obed-edom, and the treasures of the king’s house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>25</sup> And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years. <sup class='bibleverse'>26</sup> Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold, are they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel?</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>27</sup> Now after the time that Amaziah did turn away from following the LORD they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem; and he fled to Lachish: but they sent to Lachish after him, and slew him there.<sup>[<strong>25:27</strong> from…: Heb. from after]</sup>[<strong>25:27</strong> made…: Heb. conspired a conspiracy] <sup class='bibleverse'>28</sup> And they brought him upon horses, and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah.<a href="#fn137" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref137" role="doc-noteref"><sup>137</sup></a></p>

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>1</sup> Then all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in the room of his father Amaziah.<a href="#fn138" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref138" role="doc-noteref"><sup>138</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>2</sup> He built Eloth, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept with his fathers. <sup class='bibleverse'>3</sup> Sixteen years old was Uzziah when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty and two years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name also was Jecoliah of Jerusalem. <sup class='bibleverse'>4</sup> And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father Amaziah did. <sup class='bibleverse'>5</sup> And he sought God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding in the visions of God: and as long as he sought the LORD, God made him to prosper.<a href="#fn139" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref139" role="doc-noteref"><sup>139</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>6</sup> And he went forth and warred against the Philistines, and brake down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod, and built cities about Ashdod, and among the Philistines.<a href="#fn140" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref140" role="doc-noteref"><sup>140</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>7</sup> And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians that dwelt in Gur-baal, and the Mehunims. <sup class='bibleverse'>8</sup> And the Ammonites gave gifts to Uzziah: and his name spread abroad even to the entering in of Egypt; for he strengthened himself exceedingly.<a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141" role="doc-noteref"><sup>141</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>9</sup> Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate, and at the valley gate, and at the turning of the wall, and fortified them.<a href="#fn142" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref142" role="doc-noteref"><sup>142</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>10</sup> Also he built towers in the desert, and digged many wells: for he had much cattle, both in the low country, and in the plains: husbandmen also, and vine dressers in the mountains, and in Carmel: for he loved husbandry.<sup>[<strong>26:10</strong> digged…: or, cut out many cisterns]</sup>[<strong>26:10</strong> Carmel: or, fruitful fields]<a href="#fn143" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref143" role="doc-noteref"><sup>143</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>11</sup> Moreover Uzziah had an host of fighting men, that went out to war by bands, according to the number of their account by the hand of Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the ruler, under the hand of Hananiah, one of the king’s captains. <sup class='bibleverse'>12</sup> The whole number of the chief of the fathers of the mighty men of valour were two thousand and six hundred. <sup class='bibleverse'>13</sup> And under their hand was an army, three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred, that made war with mighty power, to help the king against the enemy.<a href="#fn144" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref144" role="doc-noteref"><sup>144</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>14</sup> And Uzziah prepared for them throughout all the host shields, and spears, and helmets, and habergeons, and bows, and slings to cast stones.<a href="#fn145" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref145" role="doc-noteref"><sup>145</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>15</sup> And he made in Jerusalem engines, invented by cunning men, to be on the towers and upon the bulwarks, to shoot arrows and great stones withal. And his name spread far abroad; for he was marvellously helped, till he was strong.<a href="#fn146" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref146" role="doc-noteref"><sup>146</sup></a></p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>16</sup> But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to his destruction: for he transgressed against the LORD his God, and went into the temple of the LORD to burn incense upon the altar of incense. <sup class='bibleverse'>17</sup> And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him fourscore priests of the LORD, that were valiant men: <sup class='bibleverse'>18</sup> And they withstood Uzziah the king, and said unto him, It appertaineth not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn incense unto the LORD, but to the priests the sons of Aaron, that are consecrated to burn incense: go out of the sanctuary; for thou hast trespassed; neither shall it be for thine honour from the LORD God. <sup class='bibleverse'>19</sup> Then Uzziah was wroth, and had a censer in his hand to burn incense: and while he was wroth with the priests, the leprosy even rose up in his forehead before the priests in the house of the LORD, from beside the incense altar. <sup class='bibleverse'>20</sup> And Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked upon him, and, behold, he was leprous in his forehead, and they thrust him out from thence; yea, himself hasted also to go out, because the LORD had smitten him. <sup class='bibleverse'>21</sup> And Uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt in a several house, being a leper; for he was cut off from the house of the LORD: and Jotham his son was over the king’s house, judging the people of the land.<a href="#fn147" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref147" role="doc-noteref"><sup>147</sup></a></p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>22</sup> Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, did Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, write. <sup class='bibleverse'>23</sup> So Uzziah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the field of the burial which belonged to the kings; for they said, He is a leper: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead.</p>
<h1 id="section-26">27</h1>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>1</sup> Jotham was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name also was Jerushah, the daughter of Zadok. <sup class='bibleverse'>2</sup> And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father Uzziah did: howbeit he entered not into the temple of the LORD. And the people did yet corruptly. <sup class='bibleverse'>3</sup> He built the high gate of the house of the LORD, and on the wall of Ophel he built much.<a href="#fn148" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref148" role="doc-noteref"><sup>148</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>4</sup> Moreover he built cities in the mountains of Judah, and in the forests he built castles and towers.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>5</sup> He fought also with the king of the Ammonites, and prevailed against them. And the children of Ammon gave him the same year an hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand measures of wheat, and ten thousand of barley. So much did the children of Ammon pay unto him, both the second year, and the third.<a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149" role="doc-noteref"><sup>149</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>6</sup> So Jotham became mighty, because he prepared his ways before the LORD his God.<a href="#fn150" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref150" role="doc-noteref"><sup>150</sup></a></p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>7</sup> Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars, and his ways, lo, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah. <sup class='bibleverse'>8</sup> He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>9</sup> And Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead.</p>
<h1 id="section-27">28</h1>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>1</sup> Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: but he did not that which was right in the sight of the LORD, like David his father: <sup class='bibleverse'>2</sup> For he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and made also molten images for Baalim. <sup class='bibleverse'>3</sup> Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burnt his children in the fire, after the abominations of the heathen whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel.<a href="#fn151" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref151" role="doc-noteref"><sup>151</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>4</sup> He sacrificed also and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree. <sup class='bibleverse'>5</sup> Wherefore the LORD his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria; and they smote him, and carried away a great multitude of them captives, and brought them to Damascus. And he was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who smote him with a great slaughter.<a href="#fn152" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref152" role="doc-noteref"><sup>152</sup></a></p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>6</sup> For Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah an hundred and twenty thousand in one day, which were all valiant men; because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers.<a href="#fn153" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref153" role="doc-noteref"><sup>153</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>7</sup> And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slew Maaseiah the king’s son, and Azrikam the governor of the house, and Elkanah that was next to the king.<a href="#fn154" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref154" role="doc-noteref"><sup>154</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>8</sup> And the children of Israel carried away captive of their brethren two hundred thousand, women, sons, and daughters, and took also away much spoil from them, and brought the spoil to Samaria. <sup class='bibleverse'>9</sup> But a prophet of the LORD was there, whose name was Oded: and he went out before the host that came to Samaria, and said unto them, Behold, because the LORD God of your fathers was wroth with Judah, he hath delivered them into your hand, and ye have slain them in a rage that reacheth up unto heaven. <sup class='bibleverse'>10</sup> And now ye purpose to keep under the children of Judah and Jerusalem for bondmen and bondwomen unto you: but are there not with you, even with you, sins against the LORD your God? <sup class='bibleverse'>11</sup> Now hear me therefore, and deliver the captives again, which ye have taken captive of your brethren: for the fierce wrath of the LORD is upon you. <sup class='bibleverse'>12</sup> Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against them that came from the war, <sup class='bibleverse'>13</sup> And said unto them, Ye shall not bring in the captives hither: for whereas we have offended against the LORD already, ye intend to add more to our sins and to our trespass: for our trespass is great, and there is fierce wrath against Israel. <sup class='bibleverse'>14</sup> So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the congregation. <sup class='bibleverse'>15</sup> And the men which were expressed by name rose up, and took the captives, and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among them, and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat and to drink, and anointed them, and carried all the feeble of them upon asses, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm trees, to their brethren: then they returned to Samaria.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>16</sup> At that time did king Ahaz send unto the kings of Assyria to help him. <sup class='bibleverse'>17</sup> For again the Edomites had come and smitten Judah, and carried away captives.<a href="#fn155" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref155" role="doc-noteref"><sup>155</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>18</sup> The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the low country, and of the south of Judah, and had taken Beth-shemesh, and Ajalon, and Gederoth, and Shocho with the villages thereof, and Timnah with the villages thereof, Gimzo also and the villages thereof: and they dwelt there. <sup class='bibleverse'>19</sup> For the LORD brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel; for he made Judah naked, and transgressed sore against the LORD. <sup class='bibleverse'>20</sup> And Tilgath-pilneser king of Assyria came unto him, and distressed him, but strengthened him not. <sup class='bibleverse'>21</sup> For Ahaz took away a portion out of the house of the LORD, and out of the house of the king, and of the princes, and gave it unto the king of Assyria: but he helped him not.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>22</sup> And in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more against the LORD: this is that king Ahaz. <sup class='bibleverse'>23</sup> For he sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus, which smote him: and he said, Because the gods of the kings of Syria help them, therefore will I sacrifice to them, that they may help me. But they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel.<a href="#fn156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref156" role="doc-noteref"><sup>156</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>24</sup> And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God, and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shut up the doors of the house of the LORD, and he made him altars in every corner of Jerusalem. <sup class='bibleverse'>25</sup> And in every several city of Judah he made high places to burn incense unto other gods, and provoked to anger the LORD God of his fathers.<a href="#fn157" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref157" role="doc-noteref"><sup>157</sup></a></p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>26</sup> Now the rest of his acts and of all his ways, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. <sup class='bibleverse'>27</sup> And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, even in Jerusalem: but they brought him not into the sepulchres of the kings of Israel: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.</p>

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>1</sup> Hezekiah began to reign when he was five and twenty years old, and he reigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem.

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>3</sup> He in the first year of his reign, in the first month, opened the doors of the house of the LORD, and repaired them. <sup class='bibleverse'>4</sup> And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them together into the east street, <sup class='bibleverse'>5</sup> And said unto them, Hear me, ye Levites, sanctify now yourselves, and sanctify the house of the LORD God of your fathers, and carry forth the filthiness out of the holy place. <sup class='bibleverse'>6</sup> For our fathers have trespassed, and done that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD our God, and have forsaken him, and have turned away their faces from the habitation of the LORD, and turned their backs.<a href="#fn158" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref158" role="doc-noteref"><sup>158</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>7</sup> Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in the holy place unto the God of Israel. <sup class='bibleverse'>8</sup> Wherefore the wrath of the LORD was upon Judah and Jerusalem, and he hath delivered them to trouble, to astonishment, and to hissing, as ye see with your eyes.<a href="#fn159" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref159" role="doc-noteref"><sup>159</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>9</sup> For, lo, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this. <sup class='bibleverse'>10</sup> Now it is in mine heart to make a covenant with the LORD God of Israel, that his fierce wrath may turn away from us. <sup class='bibleverse'>11</sup> My sons, be not now negligent: for the LORD hath chosen you to stand before him, to serve him, and that ye should minister unto him, and burn incense.<sup>[<strong>29:11</strong> be not…: or, be not now deceived]</sup>[<strong>29:11</strong> burn…: or, offer sacrifice]</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>12</sup> Then the Levites arose, Mahath the son of Amasai, and Joel the son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites: and of the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of Jehalelel: and of the Gershonites; Joah the son of Zimmah, and Eden the son of Joah: <sup class='bibleverse'>13</sup> And of the sons of Elizaphan; Shimri, and Jeiel: and of the sons of Asaph; Zechariah, and Mattaniah: <sup class='bibleverse'>14</sup> And of the sons of Heman; Jehiel, and Shimei: and of the sons of Jeduthun; Shemaiah, and Uzziel. <sup class='bibleverse'>15</sup> And they gathered their brethren, and sanctified themselves, and came, according to the commandment of the king, by the words of the LORD, to cleanse the house of the LORD.<a href="#fn160" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref160" role="doc-noteref"><sup>160</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>16</sup> And the priests went into the inner part of the house of the LORD, to cleanse it, and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of the LORD into the court of the house of the LORD.

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>20</sup> Then Hezekiah the king rose early, and gathered the rulers of the city, and went up to the house of the LORD. <sup class='bibleverse'>21</sup> And they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven he goats, for a sin offering for the kingdom, and for the sanctuary, and for Judah.

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>1</sup> And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, to keep the passover unto the LORD God of Israel. <sup class='bibleverse'>2</sup> For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the congregation in Jerusalem, to keep the passover in the second month. <sup class='bibleverse'>3</sup> For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not sanctified themselves sufficiently, neither had the people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem. <sup class='bibleverse'>4</sup> And the thing pleased the king and all the congregation.<a href="#fn166" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref166" role="doc-noteref"><sup>166</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>5</sup> So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beer-sheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the passover unto the LORD God of Israel at Jerusalem: for they had not done it of a long time in such sort as it was written. <sup class='bibleverse'>6</sup> So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of the king, saying, Ye children of Israel, turn again unto the LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and he will return to the remnant of you, that are escaped out of the hand of the kings of Assyria.<a href="#fn167" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref167" role="doc-noteref"><sup>167</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>7</sup> And be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren, which trespassed against the LORD God of their fathers, who therefore gave them up to desolation, as ye see. <sup class='bibleverse'>8</sup> Now be ye not stiffnecked, as your fathers were, but yield yourselves unto the LORD, and enter into his sanctuary, which he hath sanctified for ever: and serve the LORD your God, that the fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you.<sup>[<strong>30:8</strong> be ye…: Heb. harden not your necks]</sup>[<strong>30:8</strong> yield…: Heb. give the hand] <sup class='bibleverse'>9</sup> For if ye turn again unto the LORD, your brethren and your children shall find compassion before them that lead them captive, so that they shall come again into this land: for the LORD your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away his face from you, if ye return unto him. <sup class='bibleverse'>10</sup> So the posts passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh even unto Zebulun: but they laughed them to scorn, and mocked them. <sup class='bibleverse'>11</sup> Nevertheless divers of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem. <sup class='bibleverse'>12</sup> Also in Judah the hand of God was to give them one heart to do the commandment of the king and of the princes, by the word of the LORD.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>13</sup> And there assembled at Jerusalem much people to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great congregation. <sup class='bibleverse'>14</sup> And they arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem, and all the altars for incense took they away, and cast them into the brook Kidron. <sup class='bibleverse'>15</sup> Then they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the second month: and the priests and the Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought in the burnt offerings into the house of the LORD. <sup class='bibleverse'>16</sup> And they stood in their place after their manner, according to the law of Moses the man of God: the priests sprinkled the blood, which they received of the hand of the Levites.<a href="#fn168" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref168" role="doc-noteref"><sup>168</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>17</sup> For there were many in the congregation that were not sanctified: therefore the Levites had the charge of the killing of the passovers for every one that was not clean, to sanctify them unto the LORD. <sup class='bibleverse'>18</sup> For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim, and Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet did they eat the passover otherwise than it was written. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, The good LORD pardon every one <sup class='bibleverse'>19</sup> That prepareth his heart to seek God, the LORD God of his fathers, though he be not cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuary. <sup class='bibleverse'>20</sup> And the LORD hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>21</sup> And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness: and the Levites and the priests praised the LORD day by day, singing with loud instruments unto the LORD.<sup>[<strong>30:21</strong> present: Heb. found]</sup>[<strong>30:21</strong> loud…: Heb. instruments of strength] <sup class='bibleverse'>22</sup> And Hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the Levites that taught the good knowledge of the LORD: and they did eat throughout the feast seven days, offering peace offerings, and making confession to the LORD God of their fathers.<a href="#fn169" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref169" role="doc-noteref"><sup>169</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>23</sup> And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days: and they kept other seven days with gladness. <sup class='bibleverse'>24</sup> For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the congregation a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves.<sup>[<strong>30:24</strong> did give: Heb. lifted up, or, offered]</sup>[<strong>30:24</strong> gave: Heb. lifted up, or, offered] <sup class='bibleverse'>25</sup> And all the congregation of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the congregation that came out of Israel, and the strangers that came out of the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced. <sup class='bibleverse'>26</sup> So there was great joy in Jerusalem: for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like in Jerusalem.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>27</sup> Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and their voice was heard, and their prayer came up to his holy dwelling place, even unto heaven.<a href="#fn170" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref170" role="doc-noteref"><sup>170</sup></a></p>

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>1</sup> Now when all this was finished, all Israel that were present went out to the cities of Judah, and brake the images in pieces, and cut down the groves, and threw down the high places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they had utterly destroyed them all.

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>2</sup> And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites after their courses, every man according to his service, the priests and Levites for burnt offerings and for peace offerings, to minister, and to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the tents of the LORD. <sup class='bibleverse'>3</sup> He appointed also the king’s portion of his substance for the burnt offerings, to wit, for the morning and evening burnt offerings, and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths, and for the new moons, and for the set feasts, as it is written in the law of the LORD. <sup class='bibleverse'>4</sup> Moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might be encouraged in the law of the LORD.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>5</sup> And as soon as the commandment came abroad, the children of Israel brought in abundance the firstfruits of corn, wine, and oil, and honey, and of all the increase of the field; and the tithe of all things brought they in abundantly.<sup>[<strong>31:5</strong> came…: Heb. brake forth]</sup>[<strong>31:5</strong> honey: or, dates] <sup class='bibleverse'>6</sup> And concerning the children of Israel and Judah, that dwelt in the cities of Judah, they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep, and the tithe of holy things which were consecrated unto the LORD their God, and laid them by heaps.<a href="#fn172" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref172" role="doc-noteref"><sup>172</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>7</sup> In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps, and finished them in the seventh month. <sup class='bibleverse'>8</sup> And when Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they blessed the LORD, and his people Israel. <sup class='bibleverse'>9</sup> Then Hezekiah questioned with the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps. <sup class='bibleverse'>10</sup> And Azariah the chief priest of the house of Zadok answered him, and said, Since the people began to bring the offerings into the house of the LORD, we have had enough to eat, and have left plenty: for the LORD hath blessed his people; and that which is left is this great store.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>11</sup> Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of the LORD; and they prepared them,<a href="#fn173" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref173" role="doc-noteref"><sup>173</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>12</sup> And brought in the offerings and the tithes and the dedicated things faithfully: over which Cononiah the Levite was ruler, and Shimei his brother was the next. <sup class='bibleverse'>13</sup> And Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and Benaiah, were overseers under the hand of Cononiah and Shimei his brother, at the commandment of Hezekiah the king, and Azariah the ruler of the house of God.<a href="#fn174" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref174" role="doc-noteref"><sup>174</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>14</sup> And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the porter toward the east, was over the freewill offerings of God, to distribute the oblations of the LORD, and the most holy things. <sup class='bibleverse'>15</sup> And next him were Eden, and Miniamin, and Jeshua, and Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the cities of the priests, in their set office, to give to their brethren by courses, as well to the great as to the small:<sup>[<strong>31:15</strong> next…: Heb. at his hand]</sup>[<strong>31:15</strong> set…: or, trust] <sup class='bibleverse'>16</sup> Beside their genealogy of males, from three years old and upward, even unto every one that entereth into the house of the LORD, his daily portion for their service in their charges according to their courses; <sup class='bibleverse'>17</sup> Both to the genealogy of the priests by the house of their fathers, and the Levites from twenty years old and upward, in their charges by their courses; <sup class='bibleverse'>18</sup> And to the genealogy of all their little ones, their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, through all the congregation: for in their set office they sanctified themselves in holiness:<a href="#fn175" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref175" role="doc-noteref"><sup>175</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>19</sup> Also of the sons of Aaron the priests, which were in the fields of the suburbs of their cities, in every several city, the men that were expressed by name, to give portions to all the males among the priests, and to all that were reckoned by genealogies among the Levites.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>20</sup> And thus did Hezekiah throughout all Judah, and wrought that which was good and right and truth before the LORD his God. <sup class='bibleverse'>21</sup> And in every work that he began in the service of the house of God, and in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his God, he did it with all his heart, and prospered.</p>

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>9</sup> After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants to Jerusalem, (but he himself laid siege against Lachish, and all his power with him,) unto Hezekiah king of Judah, and unto all Judah that were at Jerusalem, saying,<a href="#fn182" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref182" role="doc-noteref"><sup>182</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>10</sup> Thus saith Sennacherib king of Assyria, Whereon do ye trust, that ye abide in the siege in Jerusalem?<a href="#fn183" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref183" role="doc-noteref"><sup>183</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>11</sup> Doth not Hezekiah persuade you to give over yourselves to die by famine and by thirst, saying, The LORD our God shall deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria? <sup class='bibleverse'>12</sup> Hath not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall worship before one altar, and burn incense upon it? <sup class='bibleverse'>13</sup> Know ye not what I and my fathers have done unto all the people of other lands? were the gods of the nations of those lands any ways able to deliver their lands out of mine hand? <sup class='bibleverse'>14</sup> Who was there among all the gods of those nations that my fathers utterly destroyed, that could deliver his people out of mine hand, that your God should be able to deliver you out of mine hand? <sup class='bibleverse'>15</sup> Now therefore let not Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you on this manner, neither yet believe him: for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of mine hand, and out of the hand of my fathers: how much less shall your God deliver you out of mine hand? <sup class='bibleverse'>16</sup> And his servants spake yet more against the LORD God, and against his servant Hezekiah. <sup class='bibleverse'>17</sup> He wrote also letters to rail on the LORD God of Israel, and to speak against him, saying, As the gods of the nations of other lands have not delivered their people out of mine hand, so shall not the God of Hezekiah deliver his people out of mine hand. <sup class='bibleverse'>18</sup> Then they cried with a loud voice in the Jews’ speech unto the people of Jerusalem that were on the wall, to affright them, and to trouble them; that they might take the city. <sup class='bibleverse'>19</sup> And they spake against the God of Jerusalem, as against the gods of the people of the earth, which were the work of the hands of man. <sup class='bibleverse'>20</sup> And for this cause Hezekiah the king, and the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz, prayed and cried to heaven.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>21</sup> And the LORD sent an angel, which cut off all the mighty men of valour, and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king of Assyria.

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>3</sup> For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down, and he reared up altars for Baalim, and made groves, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them.<a href="#fn192" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref192" role="doc-noteref"><sup>192</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>4</sup> Also he built altars in the house of the LORD, whereof the LORD had said, In Jerusalem shall my name be for ever. <sup class='bibleverse'>5</sup> And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD. <sup class='bibleverse'>6</sup> And he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom: also he observed times, and used enchantments, and used witchcraft, and dealt with a familiar spirit, and with wizards: he wrought much evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger. <sup class='bibleverse'>7</sup> And he set a carved image, the idol which he had made, in the house of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen before all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever: <sup class='bibleverse'>8</sup> Neither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from out of the land which I have appointed for your fathers; so that they will take heed to do all that I have commanded them, according to the whole law and the statutes and the ordinances by the hand of Moses. <sup class='bibleverse'>9</sup> So Manasseh made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to err, and to do worse than the heathen, whom the LORD had destroyed before the children of Israel. <sup class='bibleverse'>10</sup> And the LORD spake to Manasseh, and to his people: but they would not hearken.</p>
