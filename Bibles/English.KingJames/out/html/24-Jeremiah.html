<p><sup class='bibleverse'>1</sup> The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin: <sup class='bibleverse'>2</sup> To whom the word of the LORD came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign. <sup class='bibleverse'>3</sup> It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, unto the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah king of Judah, unto the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>4</sup> Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, <sup class='bibleverse'>5</sup> Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>6</sup> Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, I cannot speak: for I am a child.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>7</sup> But the LORD said unto me, Say not, I am a child: for thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee, and whatsoever I command thee thou shalt speak. <sup class='bibleverse'>8</sup> Be not afraid of their faces: for I am with thee to deliver thee, saith the LORD. <sup class='bibleverse'>9</sup> Then the LORD put forth his hand, and touched my mouth. And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth. <sup class='bibleverse'>10</sup> See, I have this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw down, to build, and to plant.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>11</sup> Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, Jeremiah, what seest thou? And I said, I see a rod of an almond tree. <sup class='bibleverse'>12</sup> Then said the LORD unto me, Thou hast well seen: for I will hasten my word to perform it. <sup class='bibleverse'>13</sup> And the word of the LORD came unto me the second time, saying, What seest thou?

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>17</sup> Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak unto them all that I command thee: be not dismayed at their faces, lest I confound thee before them.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>18</sup> For, behold, I have made thee this day a defenced city, and an iron pillar, and brasen walls against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against the princes thereof, against the priests thereof, and against the people of the land. <sup class='bibleverse'>19</sup> And they shall fight against thee; but they shall not prevail against thee; for I am with thee, saith the LORD, to deliver thee.</p>

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>5</sup> Then the prophet Jeremiah said unto the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the people that stood in the house of the LORD, <sup class='bibleverse'>6</sup> Even the prophet Jeremiah said, Amen: the LORD do so: the LORD perform thy words which thou hast prophesied, to bring again the vessels of the LORD’s house, and all that is carried away captive, from Babylon into this place. <sup class='bibleverse'>7</sup> Nevertheless hear thou now this word that I speak in thine ears, and in the ears of all the people; <sup class='bibleverse'>8</sup> The prophets that have been before me and before thee of old prophesied both against many countries, and against great kingdoms, of war, and of evil, and of pestilence. <sup class='bibleverse'>9</sup> The prophet which prophesieth of peace, when the word of the prophet shall come to pass, then shall the prophet be known, that the LORD hath truly sent him.</p>

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>1</sup> Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.<a href="#fn290" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref290" role="doc-noteref"><sup>290</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>2</sup> And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD, according to all that Jehoiakim had done. <sup class='bibleverse'>3</sup> For through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah, till he had cast them out from his presence, that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>4</sup> And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and pitched against it, and built forts against it round about. <sup class='bibleverse'>5</sup> So the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah. <sup class='bibleverse'>6</sup> And in the fourth month, in the ninth day of the month, the famine was sore in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land. <sup class='bibleverse'>7</sup> Then the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled, and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king’s garden; (now the Chaldeans were by the city round about:) and they went by the way of the plain.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>8</sup> But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him. <sup class='bibleverse'>9</sup> Then they took the king, and carried him up unto the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; where he gave judgment upon him. <sup class='bibleverse'>10</sup> And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes: he slew also all the princes of Judah in Riblah. <sup class='bibleverse'>11</sup> Then he put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him in chains, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the day of his death.<sup>[<strong>52:11</strong> put out: Heb. blinded]</sup>[<strong>52:11</strong> chains: or, fetters]<a href="#fn291" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref291" role="doc-noteref"><sup>291</sup></a></p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>12</sup> Now in the fifth month, in the tenth day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, came Nebuzar-adan, captain of the guard, which served the king of Babylon, into Jerusalem,<sup>[<strong>52:12</strong> captain…: or, chief marshal: Heb. chief of the executioners, or, slaughtermen]</sup>[<strong>52:12</strong> served: Heb. stood before] <sup class='bibleverse'>13</sup> And burned the house of the LORD, and the king’s house; and all the houses of Jerusalem, and all the houses of the great men, burned he with fire: <sup class='bibleverse'>14</sup> And all the army of the Chaldeans, that were with the captain of the guard, brake down all the walls of Jerusalem round about. <sup class='bibleverse'>15</sup> Then Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard carried away captive certain of the poor of the people, and the residue of the people that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the multitude. <sup class='bibleverse'>16</sup> But Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard left certain of the poor of the land for vinedressers and for husbandmen. <sup class='bibleverse'>17</sup> Also the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD, and the bases, and the brasen sea that was in the house of the LORD, the Chaldeans brake, and carried all the brass of them to Babylon. <sup class='bibleverse'>18</sup> The caldrons also, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the bowls, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered, took they away.<sup>[<strong>52:18</strong> shovels: or, instruments to remove the ashes]</sup>[<strong>52:18</strong> bowls: or, basons] <sup class='bibleverse'>19</sup> And the basons, and the firepans, and the bowls, and the caldrons, and the candlesticks, and the spoons, and the cups; that which was of gold in gold, and that which was of silver in silver, took the captain of the guard away.<a href="#fn292" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref292" role="doc-noteref"><sup>292</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>20</sup> The two pillars, one sea, and twelve brasen bulls that were under the bases, which king Solomon had made in the house of the LORD: the brass of all these vessels was without weight.<a href="#fn293" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref293" role="doc-noteref"><sup>293</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>21</sup> And concerning the pillars, the height of one pillar was eighteen cubits; and a fillet of twelve cubits did compass it; and the thickness thereof was four fingers: it was hollow.<a href="#fn294" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref294" role="doc-noteref"><sup>294</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>22</sup> And a chapiter of brass was upon it; and the height of one chapiter was five cubits, with network and pomegranates upon the chapiters round about, all of brass. The second pillar also and the pomegranates were like unto these. <sup class='bibleverse'>23</sup> And there were ninety and six pomegranates on a side; and all the pomegranates upon the network were an hundred round about.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>24</sup> And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door:<a href="#fn295" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref295" role="doc-noteref"><sup>295</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>25</sup> He took also out of the city an eunuch, which had the charge of the men of war; and seven men of them that were near the king’s person, which were found in the city; and the principal scribe of the host, who mustered the people of the land; and threescore men of the people of the land, that were found in the midst of the city.<sup>[<strong>52:25</strong> were near…: Heb. saw the face of the king]</sup>[<strong>52:25</strong> principal…: or, scribe of the captain of the host] <sup class='bibleverse'>26</sup> So Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah. <sup class='bibleverse'>27</sup> And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death in Riblah in the land of Hamath. Thus Judah was carried away captive out of his own land. <sup class='bibleverse'>28</sup> This is the people whom Nebuchadrezzar carried away captive: in the seventh year three thousand Jews and three and twenty: <sup class='bibleverse'>29</sup> In the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar he carried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred thirty and two persons:<a href="#fn296" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref296" role="doc-noteref"><sup>296</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>30</sup> In the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadrezzar Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty and five persons: all the persons were four thousand and six hundred.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>31</sup> And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the five and twentieth day of the month, that Evil-merodach king of Babylon in the first year of his reign lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and brought him forth out of prison, <sup class='bibleverse'>32</sup> And spake kindly unto him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon,+ 52.32 kindly…: Heb. good things with him <sup class='bibleverse'>33</sup> And changed his prison garments: and he did continually eat bread before him all the days of his life. <sup class='bibleverse'>34</sup> And for his diet, there was a continual diet given him of the king of Babylon, every day a portion until the day of his death, all the days of his life.+ 52.34 every…: Heb. the matter of the day in his day</p>
