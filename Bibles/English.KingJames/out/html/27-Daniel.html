<p><sup class='bibleverse'>1</sup> In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it. <sup class='bibleverse'>2</sup> And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>3</sup> And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring certain of the children of Israel, and of the king’s seed, and of the princes; <sup class='bibleverse'>4</sup> Children in whom was no blemish, but well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as had ability in them to stand in the king’s palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans. <sup class='bibleverse'>5</sup> And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king’s meat, and of the wine which he drank: so nourishing them three years, that at the end thereof they might stand before the king.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>6</sup> Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: <sup class='bibleverse'>7</sup> Unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave unto Daniel the name of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abed-nego.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>8</sup> But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king’s meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself. <sup class='bibleverse'>9</sup> Now God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs. <sup class='bibleverse'>10</sup> And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your meat and your drink: for why should he see your faces worse liking than the children which are of your sort? then shall ye make me endanger my head to the king.<sup>[<strong>1:10</strong> worse…: Heb. sadder]</sup>[<strong>1:10</strong> sort: or, term, or, continuance?] <sup class='bibleverse'>11</sup> Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>12</sup> Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink.<sup>[<strong>1:12</strong> pulse: Heb. of pulse]</sup>[<strong>1:12</strong> to eat…: Heb. that we may eat, etc] <sup class='bibleverse'>13</sup> Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king’s meat: and as thou seest, deal with thy servants. <sup class='bibleverse'>14</sup> So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days. <sup class='bibleverse'>15</sup> And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king’s meat. <sup class='bibleverse'>16</sup> Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine that they should drink; and gave them pulse.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>17</sup> As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>18</sup> Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar. <sup class='bibleverse'>19</sup> And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood they before the king. <sup class='bibleverse'>20</sup> And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king enquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>21</sup> And Daniel continued even unto the first year of king Cyrus.</p>

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>1</sup> And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, wherewith his spirit was troubled, and his sleep brake from him. <sup class='bibleverse'>2</sup> Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to shew the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king. <sup class='bibleverse'>3</sup> And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream. <sup class='bibleverse'>4</sup> Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack, O king, live for ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>5</sup> The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>6</sup> But if ye shew the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour: therefore shew me the dream, and the interpretation thereof.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>7</sup> They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation of it. <sup class='bibleverse'>8</sup> The king answered and said, I know of certainty that ye would gain the time, because ye see the thing is gone from me.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>9</sup> But if ye will not make known unto me the dream, there is but one decree for you: for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can shew me the interpretation thereof.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>10</sup> The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can shew the king’s matter: therefore there is no king, lord, nor ruler, that asked such things at any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean. <sup class='bibleverse'>11</sup> And it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is none other that can shew it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh. <sup class='bibleverse'>12</sup> For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon. <sup class='bibleverse'>13</sup> And the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain; and they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>14</sup> Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the captain of the king’s guard, which was gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon:<sup>[<strong>2:14</strong> answered…: Chaldee, returned]</sup>[<strong>2:14</strong> captain…: or, chief marshal: Chaldee, chief of the executioners, or, slaughtermen] <sup class='bibleverse'>15</sup> He answered and said to Arioch the king’s captain, Why is the decree so hasty from the king? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel. <sup class='bibleverse'>16</sup> Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give him time, and that he would shew the king the interpretation. <sup class='bibleverse'>17</sup> Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions: <sup class='bibleverse'>18</sup> That they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.<sup>[<strong>2:18</strong> of the God: Chaldee, from before God]</sup>[<strong>2:18</strong> that Daniel…: or, that they should not destroy Daniel, etc]</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>19</sup> Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven. <sup class='bibleverse'>20</sup> Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever: for wisdom and might are his: <sup class='bibleverse'>21</sup> And he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings, and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding: <sup class='bibleverse'>22</sup> He revealeth the deep and secret things: he knoweth what is in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him. <sup class='bibleverse'>23</sup> I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast made known unto me now what we desired of thee: for thou hast now made known unto us the king’s matter.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>24</sup> Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise men of Babylon: he went and said thus unto him; Destroy not the wise men of Babylon: bring me in before the king, and I will shew unto the king the interpretation. <sup class='bibleverse'>25</sup> Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus unto him, I have found a man of the captives of Judah, that will make known unto the king the interpretation.<sup>[<strong>2:25</strong> I have…: Chaldee, That I have found]</sup>[<strong>2:25</strong> captives…: Chaldee, children of the captivity of Judah] <sup class='bibleverse'>26</sup> The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof? <sup class='bibleverse'>27</sup> Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, The secret which the king hath demanded cannot the wise men, the astrologers, the magicians, the soothsayers, shew unto the king; <sup class='bibleverse'>28</sup> But there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days.

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>31</sup> Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image.

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>36</sup> This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king. <sup class='bibleverse'>37</sup> Thou, O king, art a king of kings: for the God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory. <sup class='bibleverse'>38</sup> And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand, and hath made thee ruler over them all.

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>46</sup> Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odours unto him. <sup class='bibleverse'>47</sup> The king answered unto Daniel, and said, Of a truth it is, that your God is a God of gods, and a Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, seeing thou couldest reveal this secret. <sup class='bibleverse'>48</sup> Then the king made Daniel a great man, and gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and chief of the governors over all the wise men of Babylon. <sup class='bibleverse'>49</sup> Then Daniel requested of the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon: but Daniel sat in the gate of the king.</p>
<h1 id="section-2">3</h1>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>1</sup> Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof six cubits: he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon. <sup class='bibleverse'>2</sup> Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the princes, the governors, and the captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up. <sup class='bibleverse'>3</sup> Then the princes, the governors, and captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up. <sup class='bibleverse'>4</sup> Then an herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O people, nations, and languages,<sup>[<strong>3:4</strong> aloud: Chaldee, with might]</sup>[<strong>3:4</strong> it…: Chaldee, they command] <sup class='bibleverse'>5</sup> That at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up:<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>6</sup> And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace. <sup class='bibleverse'>7</sup> Therefore at that time, when all the people heard the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of musick, all the people, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>8</sup> Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and accused the Jews. <sup class='bibleverse'>9</sup> They spake and said to the king Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live for ever. <sup class='bibleverse'>10</sup> Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, shall fall down and worship the golden image:<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>11</sup> And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth, that he should be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace. <sup class='bibleverse'>12</sup> There are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the affairs of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego; these men, O king, have not regarded thee: they serve not thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>13</sup> Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego.

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>19</sup> Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego: therefore he spake, and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it was wont to be heated.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>20</sup> And he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>21</sup> Then these men were bound in their coats, their hosen, and their hats, and their other garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.<sup>[<strong>3:21</strong> coats: or, mantles]</sup>[<strong>3:21</strong> hats: or, turbans] <sup class='bibleverse'>22</sup> Therefore because the king’s commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego.<sup>[<strong>3:22</strong> commandment: Chaldee, word]</sup>[<strong>3:22</strong> flame: or, spark] <sup class='bibleverse'>23</sup> And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace. <sup class='bibleverse'>24</sup> Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonied, and rose up in haste, and spake, and said unto his counsellors, Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire?

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>26</sup> Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace, and spake, and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, ye servants of the most high God, come forth, and come hither.

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>28</sup> Then Nebuchadnezzar spake, and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king’s word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God. <sup class='bibleverse'>29</sup> Therefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, and language, which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill: because there is no other God that can deliver after this sort.<sup>[<strong>3:29</strong> I make…: Chaldee, a decree is made by me]</sup>[<strong>3:29</strong> any…: Chaldee, error]<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>30</sup> Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, in the province of Babylon.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a></p>

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>8</sup> But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods: and before him I told the dream, saying, <sup class='bibleverse'>9</sup> O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in thee, and no secret troubleth thee, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and the interpretation thereof. <sup class='bibleverse'>10</sup> Thus were the visions of mine head in my bed; I saw, and behold a tree in the midst of the earth, and the height thereof was great.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30" role="doc-noteref"><sup>30</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>11</sup> The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached unto heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth: <sup class='bibleverse'>12</sup> The leaves thereof were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was meat for all: the beasts of the field had shadow under it, and the fowls of the heaven dwelt in the boughs thereof, and all flesh was fed of it. <sup class='bibleverse'>13</sup> I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a watcher and an holy one came down from heaven; <sup class='bibleverse'>14</sup> He cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off his branches, shake off his leaves, and scatter his fruit: let the beasts get away from under it, and the fowls from his branches:<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>15</sup> Nevertheless leave the stump of his roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth: <sup class='bibleverse'>16</sup> Let his heart be changed from man’s, and let a beast’s heart be given unto him; and let seven times pass over him. <sup class='bibleverse'>17</sup> This matter is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy ones: to the intent that the living may know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the basest of men. <sup class='bibleverse'>18</sup> This dream I king Nebuchadnezzar have seen.

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>34</sup> And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and I blessed the most High, and I praised and honoured him that liveth for ever, whose dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom is from generation to generation: <sup class='bibleverse'>35</sup> And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing: and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou? <sup class='bibleverse'>36</sup> At the same time my reason returned unto me; and for the glory of my kingdom, mine honour and brightness returned unto me; and my counsellors and my lords sought unto me; and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent majesty was added unto me. <sup class='bibleverse'>37</sup> Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the King of heaven, all whose works are truth, and his ways judgment: and those that walk in pride he is able to abase.</p>
