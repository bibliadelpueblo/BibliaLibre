<p><sup class='bibleverse'>1</sup> I saw the Lord standing upon the altar: and he said, Smite the lintel of the door, that the posts may shake: and cut them in the head, all of them; and I will slay the last of them with the sword: he that fleeth of them shall not flee away, and he that escapeth of them shall not be delivered.<sup>[<strong>9:1</strong> lintel: or, chapiter, or, knop]</sup>[<strong>9:1</strong> cut…: or, wound them] <sup class='bibleverse'>2</sup> Though they dig into hell, thence shall mine hand take them; though they climb up to heaven, thence will I bring them down: <sup class='bibleverse'>3</sup> And though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search and take them out thence; and though they be hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea, thence will I command the serpent, and he shall bite them: <sup class='bibleverse'>4</sup> And though they go into captivity before their enemies, thence will I command the sword, and it shall slay them: and I will set mine eyes upon them for evil, and not for good. <sup class='bibleverse'>5</sup> And the Lord GOD of hosts is he that toucheth the land, and it shall melt, and all that dwell therein shall mourn: and it shall rise up wholly like a flood; and shall be drowned, as by the flood of Egypt. <sup class='bibleverse'>6</sup> It is he that buildeth his stories in the heaven, and hath founded his troop in the earth; he that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth: The LORD is his name.<sup>[<strong>9:6</strong> stories: or, spheres: Heb. ascensions]</sup>[<strong>9:6</strong> troop: or, bundle] <sup class='bibleverse'>7</sup> Are ye not as children of the Ethiopians unto me, O children of Israel? saith the LORD. Have not I brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt? and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir? <sup class='bibleverse'>8</sup> Behold, the eyes of the Lord GOD are upon the sinful kingdom, and I will destroy it from off the face of the earth; saving that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob, saith the LORD. <sup class='bibleverse'>9</sup> For, lo, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel among all nations, like as corn is sifted in a sieve, yet shall not the least grain fall upon the earth.<sup>[<strong>9:9</strong> sift: Heb. cause to move]</sup>[<strong>9:9</strong> grain: Heb. stone] <sup class='bibleverse'>10</sup> All the sinners of my people shall die by the sword, which say, The evil shall not overtake nor prevent us.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>11</sup> In that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen, and close up the breaches thereof; and I will raise up his ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old:+ 9.11 close: Heb. hedge, or, wall <sup class='bibleverse'>12</sup> That they may possess the remnant of Edom, and of all the heathen, which are called by my name, saith the LORD that doeth this.+ 9.12 which…: Heb. upon whom my name is called <sup class='bibleverse'>13</sup> Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that the plowman shall overtake the reaper, and the treader of grapes him that soweth seed; and the mountains shall drop sweet wine, and all the hills shall melt.+ 9.13 soweth: Heb. draweth forth+ 9.13 sweet: or, new <sup class='bibleverse'>14</sup> And I will bring again the captivity of my people of Israel, and they shall build the waste cities, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and drink the wine thereof; they shall also make gardens, and eat the fruit of them. <sup class='bibleverse'>15</sup> And I will plant them upon their land, and they shall no more be pulled up out of their land which I have given them, saith the LORD thy God.</p>
