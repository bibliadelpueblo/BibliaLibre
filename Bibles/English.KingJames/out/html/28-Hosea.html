<p><sup class='bibleverse'>1</sup> When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt. <sup class='bibleverse'>2</sup> As they called them, so they went from them: they sacrificed unto Baalim, and burned incense to graven images. <sup class='bibleverse'>3</sup> I taught Ephraim also to go, taking them by their arms; but they knew not that I healed them. <sup class='bibleverse'>4</sup> I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love: and I was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws, and I laid meat unto them.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47" role="doc-noteref"><sup>47</sup></a></p>

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>1</sup> O Israel, return unto the LORD thy God; for thou hast fallen by thine iniquity. <sup class='bibleverse'>2</sup> Take with you words, and turn to the LORD: say unto him, Take away all iniquity, and receive us graciously: so will we render the calves of our lips.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60" role="doc-noteref"><sup>60</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>3</sup> Asshur shall not save us; we will not ride upon horses: neither will we say any more to the work of our hands, Ye are our gods: for in thee the fatherless findeth mercy.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>4</sup> I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely: for mine anger is turned away from him. <sup class='bibleverse'>5</sup> I will be as the dew unto Israel: he shall grow as the lily, and cast forth his roots as Lebanon.<sup>[<strong>14:5</strong> grow: or, blossom]</sup>[<strong>14:5</strong> cast…: Heb. strike] <sup class='bibleverse'>6</sup> His branches shall spread, and his beauty shall be as the olive tree, and his smell as Lebanon.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61" role="doc-noteref"><sup>61</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>7</sup> They that dwell under his shadow shall return; they shall revive as the corn, and grow as the vine: the scent thereof shall be as the wine of Lebanon.<sup>[<strong>14:7</strong> grow: or, blossom]</sup>[<strong>14:7</strong> scent: or, memorial]</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>8</sup> Ephraim shall say, What have I to do any more with idols? I have heard him, and observed him: I am like a green fir tree. From me is thy fruit found. <sup class='bibleverse'>9</sup> Who is wise, and he shall understand these things? prudent, and he shall know them? for the ways of the LORD are right, and the just shall walk in them: but the transgressors shall fall therein.</p>
