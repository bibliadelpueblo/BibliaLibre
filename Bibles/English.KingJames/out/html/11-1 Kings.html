<p><sup class='bibleverse'>1</sup> Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he gat no heat.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>2</sup> Wherefore his servants said unto him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the king, and let her cherish him, and let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord the king may get heat.<sup>[<strong>1:2</strong> Let there…: Heb.

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>5</sup> Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king: and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>6</sup> And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why hast thou done so? and he also was a very goodly man; and his mother bare him after Absalom.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>7</sup> And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest: and they following Adonijah helped him.<sup>[<strong>1:7</strong> he…: Heb. his words were with]</sup>[<strong>1:7</strong> following…: Heb. helped after Adonijah] <sup class='bibleverse'>8</sup> But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men which belonged to David, were not with Adonijah. <sup class='bibleverse'>9</sup> And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of Zoheleth, which is by En-rogel, and called all his brethren the king’s sons, and all the men of Judah the king’s servants:<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>10</sup> But Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he called not.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>11</sup> Wherefore Nathan spake unto Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon, saying, Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith doth reign, and David our lord knoweth it not? <sup class='bibleverse'>12</sup> Now therefore come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that thou mayest save thine own life, and the life of thy son Solomon. <sup class='bibleverse'>13</sup> Go and get thee in unto king David, and say unto him, Didst not thou, my lord, O king, swear unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? why then doth Adonijah reign? <sup class='bibleverse'>14</sup> Behold, while thou yet talkest there with the king, I also will come in after thee, and confirm thy words.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>15</sup> And Bath-sheba went in unto the king into the chamber: and the king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite ministered unto the king. <sup class='bibleverse'>16</sup> And Bath-sheba bowed, and did obeisance unto the king. And the king said, What wouldest thou?<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>17</sup> And she said unto him, My lord, thou swarest by the LORD thy God unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne. <sup class='bibleverse'>18</sup> And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and now, my lord the king, thou knowest it not: <sup class='bibleverse'>19</sup> And he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the host: but Solomon thy servant hath he not called. <sup class='bibleverse'>20</sup> And thou, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee, that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him. <sup class='bibleverse'>21</sup> Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>22</sup> And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet also came in. <sup class='bibleverse'>23</sup> And they told the king, saying, Behold Nathan the prophet. And when he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground. <sup class='bibleverse'>24</sup> And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? <sup class='bibleverse'>25</sup> For he is gone down this day, and hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the king’s sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they eat and drink before him, and say, God save king Adonijah.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>26</sup> But me, even me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, hath he not called. <sup class='bibleverse'>27</sup> Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not shewed it unto thy servant, who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>28</sup> Then king David answered and said, Call me Bath-sheba. And she came into the king’s presence, and stood before the king.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>29</sup> And the king sware, and said, As the LORD liveth, that hath redeemed my soul out of all distress, <sup class='bibleverse'>30</sup> Even as I sware unto thee by the LORD God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead; even so will I certainly do this day. <sup class='bibleverse'>31</sup> Then Bath-sheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did reverence to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>32</sup> And king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the king. <sup class='bibleverse'>33</sup> The king also said unto them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, and bring him down to Gihon:<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>34</sup> And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel: and blow ye with the trumpet, and say, God save king Solomon. <sup class='bibleverse'>35</sup> Then ye shall come up after him, that he may come and sit upon my throne; for he shall be king in my stead: and I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah. <sup class='bibleverse'>36</sup> And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, Amen: the LORD God of my lord the king say so too. <sup class='bibleverse'>37</sup> As the LORD hath been with my lord the king, even so be he with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David. <sup class='bibleverse'>38</sup> So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David’s mule, and brought him to Gihon. <sup class='bibleverse'>39</sup> And Zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, God save king Solomon. <sup class='bibleverse'>40</sup> And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>41</sup> And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, Wherefore is this noise of the city being in an uproar? <sup class='bibleverse'>42</sup> And while he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came: and Adonijah said unto him, Come in; for thou art a valiant man, and bringest good tidings. <sup class='bibleverse'>43</sup> And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king David hath made Solomon king. <sup class='bibleverse'>44</sup> And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the king’s mule: <sup class='bibleverse'>45</sup> And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon: and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so that the city rang again. This is the noise that ye have heard. <sup class='bibleverse'>46</sup> And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom. <sup class='bibleverse'>47</sup> And moreover the king’s servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne. And the king bowed himself upon the bed. <sup class='bibleverse'>48</sup> And also thus said the king, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which hath given one to sit on my throne this day, mine eyes even seeing it. <sup class='bibleverse'>49</sup> And all the guests that were with Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>50</sup> And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar. <sup class='bibleverse'>51</sup> And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king Solomon: for, lo, he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear unto me to day that he will not slay his servant with the sword. <sup class='bibleverse'>52</sup> And Solomon said, If he will shew himself a worthy man, there shall not an hair of him fall to the earth: but if wickedness shall be found in him, he shall die. <sup class='bibleverse'>53</sup> So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and bowed himself to king Solomon: and Solomon said unto him, Go to thine house.</p>
<h1 id="section-1">2</h1>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>1</sup> Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he charged Solomon his son, saying, <sup class='bibleverse'>2</sup> I go the way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and shew thyself a man; <sup class='bibleverse'>3</sup> And keep the charge of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and his testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses, that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest, and whithersoever thou turnest thyself:<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>4</sup> That the LORD may continue his word which he spake concerning me, saying, If thy children take heed to their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail thee (said he) a man on the throne of Israel.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>5</sup> Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, and what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, unto Abner the son of Ner, and unto Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his girdle that was about his loins, and in his shoes that were on his feet.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>6</sup> Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar head go down to the grave in peace. <sup class='bibleverse'>7</sup> But shew kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those that eat at thy table: for so they came to me when I fled because of Absalom thy brother. <sup class='bibleverse'>8</sup> And, behold, thou hast with thee Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite of Bahurim, which cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim: but he came down to meet me at Jordan, and I sware to him by the LORD, saying, I will not put thee to death with the sword.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>9</sup> Now therefore hold him not guiltless: for thou art a wise man, and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him; but his hoar head bring thou down to the grave with blood. <sup class='bibleverse'>10</sup> So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David. <sup class='bibleverse'>11</sup> And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years: seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>12</sup> Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was established greatly.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>13</sup> And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said, Peaceably. <sup class='bibleverse'>14</sup> He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And she said, Say on. <sup class='bibleverse'>15</sup> And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: howbeit the kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother’s: for it was his from the LORD. <sup class='bibleverse'>16</sup> And now I ask one petition of thee, deny me not. And she said unto him, Say on.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>17</sup> And he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king, (for he will not say thee nay,) that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to wife. <sup class='bibleverse'>18</sup> And Bath-sheba said, Well; I will speak for thee unto the king.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>19</sup> Bath-sheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the king’s mother; and she sat on his right hand. <sup class='bibleverse'>20</sup> Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee; I pray thee, say me not nay. And the king said unto her, Ask on, my mother: for I will not say thee nay. <sup class='bibleverse'>21</sup> And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy brother to wife. <sup class='bibleverse'>22</sup> And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he is mine elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah. <sup class='bibleverse'>23</sup> Then king Solomon sware by the LORD, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life. <sup class='bibleverse'>24</sup> Now therefore, as the LORD liveth, which hath established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who hath made me an house, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death this day. <sup class='bibleverse'>25</sup> And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell upon him that he died.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>26</sup> And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee to Anathoth, unto thine own fields; for thou art worthy of death: but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou barest the ark of the Lord GOD before David my father, and because thou hast been afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>27</sup> So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the LORD; that he might fulfil the word of the LORD, which he spake concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>28</sup> Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the altar. <sup class='bibleverse'>29</sup> And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD; and, behold, he is by the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him. <sup class='bibleverse'>30</sup> And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD, and said unto him, Thus saith the king, Come forth. And he said, Nay; but I will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me. <sup class='bibleverse'>31</sup> And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the innocent blood, which Joab shed, from me, and from the house of my father. <sup class='bibleverse'>32</sup> And the LORD shall return his blood upon his own head, who fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, my father David not knowing thereof, to wit, Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah. <sup class='bibleverse'>33</sup> Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever: but upon David, and upon his seed, and upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there be peace for ever from the LORD. <sup class='bibleverse'>34</sup> So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and slew him: and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>35</sup> And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the host: and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>36</sup> And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Build thee an house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth thence any whither. <sup class='bibleverse'>37</sup> For it shall be, that on the day thou goest out, and passest over the brook Kidron, thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely die: thy blood shall be upon thine own head. <sup class='bibleverse'>38</sup> And Shimei said unto the king, The saying is good: as my lord the king hath said, so will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days. <sup class='bibleverse'>39</sup> And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish son of Maachah king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, thy servants be in Gath. <sup class='bibleverse'>40</sup> And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish to seek his servants: and Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath. <sup class='bibleverse'>41</sup> And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and was come again. <sup class='bibleverse'>42</sup> And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Did I not make thee to swear by the LORD, and protested unto thee, saying, Know for a certain, on the day thou goest out, and walkest abroad any whither, that thou shalt surely die? and thou saidst unto me, The word that I have heard is good. <sup class='bibleverse'>43</sup> Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the LORD, and the commandment that I have charged thee with? <sup class='bibleverse'>44</sup> The king said moreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the wickedness which thine heart is privy to, that thou didst to David my father: therefore the LORD shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head; <sup class='bibleverse'>45</sup> And king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the LORD for ever. <sup class='bibleverse'>46</sup> So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; which went out, and fell upon him, that he died. And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.</p>
<h1 id="section-2">3</h1>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>1</sup> And Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh’s daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house of the LORD, and the wall of Jerusalem round about. <sup class='bibleverse'>2</sup> Only the people sacrificed in high places, because there was no house built unto the name of the LORD, until those days. <sup class='bibleverse'>3</sup> And Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of David his father: only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places. <sup class='bibleverse'>4</sup> And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high place: a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer upon that altar.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>5</sup> In Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night: and God said, Ask what I shall give thee. <sup class='bibleverse'>6</sup> And Solomon said, Thou hast shewed unto thy servant David my father great mercy, according as he walked before thee in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee; and thou hast kept for him this great kindness, that thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>7</sup> And now, O LORD my God, thou hast made thy servant king instead of David my father: and I am but a little child: I know not how to go out or come in. <sup class='bibleverse'>8</sup> And thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude. <sup class='bibleverse'>9</sup> Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people, that I may discern between good and bad: for who is able to judge this thy so great a people?<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20" role="doc-noteref"><sup>20</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>10</sup> And the speech pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing. <sup class='bibleverse'>11</sup> And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life; neither hast asked riches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies; but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment;<sup>[<strong>3:11</strong> long life: Heb. many days]</sup>[<strong>3:11</strong> discern: Heb. hear] <sup class='bibleverse'>12</sup> Behold, I have done according to thy words: lo, I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart; so that there was none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee. <sup class='bibleverse'>13</sup> And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both riches, and honour: so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee all thy days.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21" role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>14</sup> And if thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as thy father David did walk, then I will lengthen thy days. <sup class='bibleverse'>15</sup> And Solomon awoke; and, behold, it was a dream. And he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and offered up burnt offerings, and offered peace offerings, and made a feast to all his servants.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>16</sup> Then came there two women, that were harlots, unto the king, and stood before him. <sup class='bibleverse'>17</sup> And the one woman said, O my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house. <sup class='bibleverse'>18</sup> And it came to pass the third day after that I was delivered, that this woman was delivered also: and we were together; there was no stranger with us in the house, save we two in the house. <sup class='bibleverse'>19</sup> And this woman’s child died in the night; because she overlaid it. <sup class='bibleverse'>20</sup> And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while thine handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom. <sup class='bibleverse'>21</sup> And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it was dead: but when I had considered it in the morning, behold, it was not my son, which I did bear. <sup class='bibleverse'>22</sup> And the other woman said, Nay; but the living is my son, and the dead is thy son. And this said, No; but the dead is thy son, and the living is my son. Thus they spake before the king. <sup class='bibleverse'>23</sup> Then said the king, The one saith, This is my son that liveth, and thy son is the dead: and the other saith, Nay; but thy son is the dead, and my son is the living. <sup class='bibleverse'>24</sup> And the king said, Bring me a sword. And they brought a sword before the king. <sup class='bibleverse'>25</sup> And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other. <sup class='bibleverse'>26</sup> Then spake the woman whose the living child was unto the king, for her bowels yearned upon her son, and she said, O my lord, give her the living child, and in no wise slay it. But the other said, Let it be neither mine nor thine, but divide it.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22" role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>27</sup> Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child, and in no wise slay it: she is the mother thereof. <sup class='bibleverse'>28</sup> And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him, to do judgment.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a></p>

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>8</sup> And his house where he dwelt had another court within the porch, which was of the like work.

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>1</sup> And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for all Israel were come to Shechem to make him king. <sup class='bibleverse'>2</sup> And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was yet in Egypt, heard of it, (for he was fled from the presence of king Solomon, and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt;) <sup class='bibleverse'>3</sup> That they sent and called him.

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>6</sup> And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men, that stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, and said, How do ye advise that I may answer this people? <sup class='bibleverse'>7</sup> And they spake unto him, saying, If thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day, and wilt serve them, and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy servants for ever. <sup class='bibleverse'>8</sup> But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had given him, and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him, and which stood before him: <sup class='bibleverse'>9</sup> And he said unto them, What counsel give ye that we may answer this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke which thy father did put upon us lighter? <sup class='bibleverse'>10</sup> And the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou speak unto this people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter unto us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little finger shall be thicker than my father’s loins. <sup class='bibleverse'>11</sup> And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my father hath chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.</p>

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>16</sup> So when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: to your tents, O Israel: now see to thine own house, David.

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>21</sup> And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah, with the tribe of Benjamin, an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men, which were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon. <sup class='bibleverse'>22</sup> But the word of God came unto Shemaiah the man of God, saying, <sup class='bibleverse'>23</sup> Speak unto Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and unto all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the remnant of the people, saying, <sup class='bibleverse'>24</sup> Thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren the children of Israel: return every man to his house; for this thing is from me.

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>25</sup> Then Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt therein; and went out from thence, and built Penuel. <sup class='bibleverse'>26</sup> And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return to the house of David: <sup class='bibleverse'>27</sup> If this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, then shall the heart of this people turn again unto their lord, even unto Rehoboam king of Judah, and they shall kill me, and go again to Rehoboam king of Judah. <sup class='bibleverse'>28</sup> Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold, and said unto them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem: behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt. <sup class='bibleverse'>29</sup> And he set the one in Beth-el, and the other put he in Dan. <sup class='bibleverse'>30</sup> And this thing became a sin: for the people went to worship before the one, even unto Dan. <sup class='bibleverse'>31</sup> And he made an house of high places, and made priests of the lowest of the people, which were not of the sons of Levi. <sup class='bibleverse'>32</sup> And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that is in Judah, and he offered upon the altar.

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>20</sup> And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word of the LORD came unto the prophet that brought him back: <sup class='bibleverse'>21</sup> And he cried unto the man of God that came from Judah, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the mouth of the LORD, and hast not kept the commandment which the LORD thy God commanded thee, <sup class='bibleverse'>22</sup> But camest back, and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place, of the which the Lord did say to thee, Eat no bread, and drink no water; thy carcase shall not come unto the sepulchre of thy fathers.</p>

And they turned aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat cried out. <sup class='bibleverse'>33</sup> And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him. <sup class='bibleverse'>34</sup> And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: wherefore he said unto the driver of his chariot, Turn thine hand, and carry me out of the host; for I am wounded.<sup>[<strong>22:34</strong> at a…: Heb. in his simplicity]</sup>[<strong>22:34</strong> joints…: Heb. joints and the breastplate]<a href="#fn192" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref192" role="doc-noteref"><sup>192</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>35</sup> And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at even: and the blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariot.<sup>[<strong>22:35</strong> increased: Heb. ascended]</sup>[<strong>22:35</strong> midst: Heb. bosom] <sup class='bibleverse'>36</sup> And there went a proclamation throughout the host about the going down of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his own country.</p>

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>51</sup> Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned two years over Israel. <sup class='bibleverse'>52</sup> And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin: <sup class='bibleverse'>53</sup> For he served Baal, and worshipped him, and provoked to anger the LORD God of Israel, according to all that his father had done.</p>
