<p><sup>1</sup> The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel; <sup>2</sup> To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding; <sup>3</sup> To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity;^*^ <sup>4</sup> To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion.+ 1.4 discretion: or, advisement <sup>5</sup> A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels: <sup>6</sup> To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings.+ 1.6 the interpretation: or, an eloquent speech <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p><sup>7</sup> The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction.^*^ <sup>8</sup> My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother: <sup>9</sup> For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck.+ 1.9 an…: Heb. an adding <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p><sup>10</sup> My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not. <sup>11</sup> If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause: <sup>12</sup> Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit: <sup>13</sup> We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil: <sup>14</sup> Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse: <sup>15</sup> My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path: <sup>16</sup> For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood. <sup>17</sup> Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.^*^ <sup>18</sup> And they lay wait for their own blood; they lurk privily for their own lives. <sup>19</sup> So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; which taketh away the life of the owners thereof. <a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p><sup>20</sup> Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets:^*^ <sup>21</sup> She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, saying, <sup>22</sup> How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge? <sup>23</sup> Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you. <a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p><sup>24</sup> Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded; <sup>25</sup> But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof: <sup>26</sup> I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh; <sup>27</sup> When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you. <sup>28</sup> Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me: <sup>29</sup> For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD: <sup>30</sup> They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof. <sup>31</sup> Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices. <sup>32</sup> For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.^*^ <sup>33</sup> But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil. <a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p><sup>1</sup> My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandments with thee; <sup>2</sup> So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, and apply thine heart to understanding; <sup>3</sup> Yea, if thou criest after knowledge, and liftest up thy voice for understanding;^*^ <sup>4</sup> If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as for hid treasures; <sup>5</sup> Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge of God. <sup>6</sup> For the LORD giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding. <sup>7</sup> He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: he is a buckler to them that walk uprightly. <sup>8</sup> He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his saints. <sup>9</sup> Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and equity; yea, every good path. <a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p><sup>10</sup> When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul; <sup>11</sup> Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee: <sup>12</sup> To deliver thee from the way of the evil man, from the man that speaketh froward things; <sup>13</sup> Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness; <sup>14</sup> Who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the frowardness of the wicked; <sup>15</sup> Whose ways are crooked, and they froward in their paths: <sup>16</sup> To deliver thee from the strange woman, even from the stranger which flattereth with her words; <sup>17</sup> Which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God. <sup>18</sup> For her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead. <sup>19</sup> None that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of the paths of life. <sup>20</sup> That thou mayest walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths of the righteous. <sup>21</sup> For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it. <sup>22</sup> But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it.^*^ <a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p><sup>1</sup> My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my commandments: <sup>2</sup> For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to thee.^*^ <sup>3</sup> Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck; write them upon the table of thine heart: <sup>4</sup> So shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight of God and man.+ 3.4 good…: or, good success <a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p><sup>7</sup> Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from evil. <sup>8</sup> It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.^*^+ 3.8 marrow: Heb. watering, or, moistening <sup>9</sup> Honour the LORD with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase: <sup>10</sup> So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine. <a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p><sup>11</sup> My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; neither be weary of his correction: <sup>12</sup> For whom the LORD loveth he correcteth; even as a father the son in whom he delighteth.</p>
<p><sup>13</sup> Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth understanding.^*^ <sup>14</sup> For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold. <sup>15</sup> She is more precious than rubies: and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her. <sup>16</sup> Length of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand riches and honour. <sup>17</sup> Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace. <sup>18</sup> She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy is every one that retaineth her. <sup>19</sup> The LORD by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding hath he established the heavens.+ 3.19 established: or, prepared <sup>20</sup> By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew. <a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p><sup>21</sup> My son, let not them depart from thine eyes: keep sound wisdom and discretion: <sup>22</sup> So shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy neck. <sup>23</sup> Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble. <sup>24</sup> When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet. <sup>25</sup> Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh. <sup>26</sup> For the LORD shall be thy confidence, and shall keep thy foot from being taken.</p>
<p><sup>27</sup> Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do it.^*^ <sup>28</sup> Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and to morrow I will give; when thou hast it by thee. <sup>29</sup> Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth securely by thee.+ 3.29 Devise…: or, Practise no evil <a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p><sup>30</sup> Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee no harm.</p>
<p><sup>31</sup> Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways.^*^ <sup>32</sup> For the froward is abomination to the LORD: but his secret is with the righteous. <a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p><sup>33</sup> The curse of the LORD is in the house of the wicked: but he blesseth the habitation of the just. <sup>34</sup> Surely he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth grace unto the lowly. <sup>35</sup> The wise shall inherit glory: but shame shall be the promotion of fools.^*^ <a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a></p>

<p><sup>2</sup> Treasures of wickedness profit nothing: but righteousness delivereth from death. <sup>3</sup> The LORD will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish: but he casteth away the substance of the wicked.^*^ <sup>4</sup> He becometh poor that dealeth with a slack hand: but the hand of the diligent maketh rich. <sup>5</sup> He that gathereth in summer is a wise son: but he that sleepeth in harvest is a son that causeth shame. <sup>6</sup> Blessings are upon the head of the just: but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked. <sup>7</sup> The memory of the just is blessed: but the name of the wicked shall rot. <sup>8</sup> The wise in heart will receive commandments: but a prating fool shall fall.+ 10.8 a prating…: Heb. a fool of lips+ 10.8 fall: Heb. be beaten <sup>9</sup> He that walketh uprightly walketh surely: but he that perverteth his ways shall be known. <sup>10</sup> He that winketh with the eye causeth sorrow: but a prating fool shall fall.+ 10.10 fall: Heb. be beaten <sup>11</sup> The mouth of a righteous man is a well of life: but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked. <sup>12</sup> Hatred stirreth up strifes: but love covereth all sins. <sup>13</sup> In the lips of him that hath understanding wisdom is found: but a rod is for the back of him that is void of understanding.+ 10.13 of understanding: Heb. of heart <sup>14</sup> Wise men lay up knowledge: but the mouth of the foolish is near destruction. <sup>15</sup> The rich man’s wealth is his strong city: the destruction of the poor is their poverty. <sup>16</sup> The labour of the righteous tendeth to life: the fruit of the wicked to sin. <sup>17</sup> He is in the way of life that keepeth instruction: but he that refuseth reproof erreth.+ 10.17 erreth: or, causeth to err <sup>18</sup> He that hideth hatred with lying lips, and he that uttereth a slander, is a fool. <sup>19</sup> In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin: but he that refraineth his lips is wise. <a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31" role="doc-noteref"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p><sup>20</sup> The tongue of the just is as choice silver: the heart of the wicked is little worth. <sup>21</sup> The lips of the righteous feed many: but fools die for want of wisdom.^*^ <sup>22</sup> The blessing of the LORD, it maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow with it. <sup>23</sup> It is as sport to a fool to do mischief: but a man of understanding hath wisdom. <a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p><sup>24</sup> The fear of the wicked, it shall come upon him: but the desire of the righteous shall be granted. <sup>25</sup> As the whirlwind passeth, so is the wicked no more: but the righteous is an everlasting foundation. <sup>26</sup> As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes, so is the sluggard to them that send him.</p>
<p><sup>27</sup> The fear of the LORD prolongeth days: but the years of the wicked shall be shortened.^*^ <sup>28</sup> The hope of the righteous shall be gladness: but the expectation of the wicked shall perish. <a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33" role="doc-noteref"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p><sup>29</sup> The way of the LORD is strength to the upright: but destruction shall be to the workers of iniquity. <sup>30</sup> The righteous shall never be removed: but the wicked shall not inhabit the earth.</p>
<p><sup>31</sup> The mouth of the just bringeth forth wisdom: but the froward tongue shall be cut out. <sup>32</sup> The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable: but the mouth of the wicked speaketh frowardness.^*^ <a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34" role="doc-noteref"><sup>34</sup></a></p>

<p><sup>5</sup> The righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way: but the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness.^*^ <sup>6</sup> The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them: but transgressors shall be taken in their own naughtiness. <sup>7</sup> When a wicked man dieth, his expectation shall perish: and the hope of unjust men perisheth. <sup>8</sup> The righteous is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked cometh in his stead. <sup>9</sup> An hypocrite with his mouth destroyeth his neighbour: but through knowledge shall the just be delivered. <a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36" role="doc-noteref"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p><sup>10</sup> When it goeth well with the righteous, the city rejoiceth: and when the wicked perish, there is shouting. <sup>11</sup> By the blessing of the upright the city is exalted: but it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.</p>
