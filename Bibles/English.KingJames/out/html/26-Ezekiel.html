<p><sup>1</sup> Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I was among the captives by the river of Chebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.^*^ <sup>2</sup> In the fifth day of the month, which was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin’s captivity, <sup>3</sup> The word of the LORD came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of the LORD was there upon him.+ 1.3 Ezekiel: Heb.

<p><sup>4</sup> And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber, out of the midst of the fire.^*^ <sup>5</sup> Also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance; they had the likeness of a man. <sup>6</sup> And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings. <sup>7</sup> And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf’s foot: and they sparkled like the colour of burnished brass.+ 1.7 straight…: Heb. a straight foot <sup>8</sup> And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and they four had their faces and their wings. <sup>9</sup> Their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went every one straight forward. <sup>10</sup> As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an eagle. <sup>11</sup> Thus were their faces: and their wings were stretched upward; two wings of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.+ 1.11 stretched…: or, divided above <sup>12</sup> And they went every one straight forward: whither the spirit was to go, they went; and they turned not when they went. <sup>13</sup> As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of lamps: it went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning. <sup>14</sup> And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning. <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p><sup>15</sup> Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold one wheel upon the earth by the living creatures, with his four faces. <sup>16</sup> The appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the colour of a beryl: and they four had one likeness: and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel. <sup>17</sup> When they went, they went upon their four sides: and they turned not when they went. <sup>18</sup> As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful; and their rings were full of eyes round about them four.^*^ <sup>19</sup> And when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them: and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up. <sup>20</sup> Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went, thither was their spirit to go; and the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.+ 1.20 of…: or, of life <sup>21</sup> When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.+ 1.21 of…: or, of life <sup>22</sup> And the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living creature was as the colour of the terrible crystal, stretched forth over their heads above. <sup>23</sup> And under the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward the other: every one had two, which covered on this side, and every one had two, which covered on that side, their bodies. <sup>24</sup> And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of speech, as the noise of an host: when they stood, they let down their wings. <sup>25</sup> And there was a voice from the firmament that was over their heads, when they stood, and had let down their wings. <a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p><sup>26</sup> And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it. <sup>27</sup> And I saw as the colour of amber, as the appearance of fire round about within it, from the appearance of his loins even upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about. <sup>28</sup> As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spake.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> And he said unto me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak unto thee. <sup>2</sup> And the spirit entered into me when he spake unto me, and set me upon my feet, that I heard him that spake unto me. <sup>3</sup> And he said unto me, Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me, even unto this very day.^*^ <sup>4</sup> For they are impudent children and stiffhearted. I do send thee unto them; and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD.+ 2.4 impudent: Heb. hard of face <sup>5</sup> And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for they are a rebellious house,) yet shall know that there hath been a prophet among them. <a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p><sup>9</sup> And when I looked, behold, an hand was sent unto me; and, lo, a roll of a book was therein; <sup>10</sup> And he spread it before me; and it was written within and without: and there was written therein lamentations, and mourning, and woe.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, eat that thou findest; eat this roll, and go speak unto the house of Israel. <sup>2</sup> So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll. <sup>3</sup> And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup> And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak with my words unto them. <sup>5</sup> For thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of an hard language, but to the house of Israel;^*^ <sup>6</sup> Not to many people of a strange speech and of an hard language, whose words thou canst not understand.

<p><sup>15</sup> Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel-abib, that dwelt by the river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained there astonished among them seven days.</p>
<p><sup>16</sup> And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, <sup>17</sup> Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me. <sup>18</sup> When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand. <sup>19</sup> Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul. <sup>20</sup> Again, When a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thine hand.^*^ <sup>21</sup> Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man, that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he is warned; also thou hast delivered thy soul. <a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p><sup>1</sup> And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I sat in mine house, and the elders of Judah sat before me, that the hand of the Lord GOD fell there upon me. <sup>2</sup> Then I beheld, and lo a likeness as the appearance of fire: from the appearance of his loins even downward, fire; and from his loins even upward, as the appearance of brightness, as the colour of amber. <sup>3</sup> And he put forth the form of an hand, and took me by a lock of mine head; and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the inner gate that looketh toward the north; where was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provoketh to jealousy. <sup>4</sup> And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, according to the vision that I saw in the plain.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> He cried also in mine ears with a loud voice, saying, Cause them that have charge over the city to draw near, even every man with his destroying weapon in his hand. <sup>2</sup> And, behold, six men came from the way of the higher gate, which lieth toward the north, and every man a slaughter weapon in his hand; and one man among them was clothed with linen, with a writer’s inkhorn by his side: and they went in, and stood beside the brasen altar.^*^+ 9.2 a slaughter…: Heb. a weapon of his breaking in pieces+ 9.2 by his…: Heb. upon his loins <sup>3</sup> And the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub, whereupon he was, to the threshold of the house.

<p><sup>1</sup> Then I looked, and, behold, in the firmament that was above the head of the cherubims there appeared over them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne. <sup>2</sup> And he spake unto the man clothed with linen, and said, Go in between the wheels, even under the cherub, and fill thine hand with coals of fire from between the cherubims, and scatter them over the city.

<p><sup>8</sup> And there appeared in the cherubims the form of a man’s hand under their wings. <sup>9</sup> And when I looked, behold the four wheels by the cherubims, one wheel by one cherub, and another wheel by another cherub: and the appearance of the wheels was as the colour of a beryl stone. <sup>10</sup> And as for their appearances, they four had one likeness, as if a wheel had been in the midst of a wheel. <sup>11</sup> When they went, they went upon their four sides; they turned not as they went, but to the place whither the head looked they followed it; they turned not as they went. <sup>12</sup> And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes round about, even the wheels that they four had.^*^ <sup>13</sup> As for the wheels, it was cried unto them in my hearing, O wheel.+ 10.13 it was…: or, they were called in my hearing, wheel, or, galgal <sup>14</sup> And every one had four faces: the first face was the face of a cherub, and the second face was the face of a man, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle. <sup>15</sup> And the cherubims were lifted up. This is the living creature that I saw by the river of Chebar. <sup>16</sup> And when the cherubims went, the wheels went by them: and when the cherubims lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the same wheels also turned not from beside them. <sup>17</sup> When they stood, these stood; and when they were lifted up, these lifted up themselves also: for the spirit of the living creature was in them.+ 10.17 of…: or, of life <sup>18</sup> Then the glory of the LORD departed from off the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubims. <sup>19</sup> And the cherubims lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the earth in my sight: when they went out, the wheels also were beside them, and every one stood at the door of the east gate of the LORD’s house; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above. <sup>20</sup> This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river of Chebar; and I knew that they were the cherubims. <sup>21</sup> Every one had four faces apiece, and every one four wings; and the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings. <sup>22</sup> And the likeness of their faces was the same faces which I saw by the river of Chebar, their appearances and themselves: they went every one straight forward. <a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23" role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a></p>

<p><sup>1</sup> Moreover the spirit lifted me up, and brought me unto the east gate of the LORD’s house, which looketh eastward: and behold at the door of the gate five and twenty men; among whom I saw Jaazaniah the son of Azur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, princes of the people. <sup>2</sup> Then said he unto me, Son of man, these are the men that devise mischief, and give wicked counsel in this city: <sup>3</sup> Which say, It is not near; let us build houses: this city is the caldron, and we be the flesh.^*^ <a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24" role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a></p>

<p><sup>13</sup> And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then fell I down upon my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah Lord GOD! wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of Israel?</p>
<p><sup>14</sup> Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, <sup>15</sup> Son of man, thy brethren, even thy brethren, the men of thy kindred, and all the house of Israel wholly, are they unto whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Get you far from the LORD: unto us is this land given in possession. <sup>16</sup> Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Although I have cast them far off among the heathen, and although I have scattered them among the countries, yet will I be to them as a little sanctuary in the countries where they shall come. <sup>17</sup> Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even gather you from the people, and assemble you out of the countries where ye have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel. <sup>18</sup> And they shall come thither, and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof from thence. <sup>19</sup> And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them an heart of flesh: <sup>20</sup> That they may walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances, and do them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God. <sup>21</sup> But as for them whose heart walketh after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations, I will recompense their way upon their own heads, saith the Lord GOD.</p>
<p><sup>22</sup> Then did the cherubims lift up their wings, and the wheels beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above. <sup>23</sup> And the glory of the LORD went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city.</p>
<p><sup>24</sup> Afterwards the spirit took me up, and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity. So the vision that I had seen went up from me. <sup>25</sup> Then I spake unto them of the captivity all the things that the LORD had shewed me.</p>

<p><sup>5</sup> But if a man be just, and do that which is lawful and right,^*^ <sup>6</sup> And hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, neither hath defiled his neighbour’s wife, neither hath come near to a menstruous woman, <sup>7</sup> And hath not oppressed any, but hath restored to the debtor his pledge, hath spoiled none by violence, hath given his bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment; <sup>8</sup> He that hath not given forth upon usury, neither hath taken any increase, that hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity, hath executed true judgment between man and man, <sup>9</sup> Hath walked in my statutes, and hath kept my judgments, to deal truly; he is just, he shall surely live, saith the Lord GOD. <a href="#fn44" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref44" role="doc-noteref"><sup>44</sup></a></p>

<p><sup>24</sup> But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and doeth according to all the abominations that the wicked man doeth, shall he live?

<p><sup>25</sup> Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal.

<p><sup>45</sup> And the righteous men, they shall judge them after the manner of adulteresses, and after the manner of women that shed blood; because they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands. <sup>46</sup> For thus saith the Lord GOD; I will bring up a company upon them, and will give them to be removed and spoiled.^*^ <sup>47</sup> And the company shall stone them with stones, and dispatch them with their swords; they shall slay their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses with fire.+ 23.47 dispatch…: or, single them out <sup>48</sup> Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all women may be taught not to do after your lewdness. <sup>49</sup> And they shall recompense your lewdness upon you, and ye shall bear the sins of your idols: and ye shall know that I am the Lord GOD. <a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69" role="doc-noteref"><sup>69</sup></a></p>

<p><sup>1</sup> Again in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, <sup>2</sup> Son of man, write thee the name of the day, even of this same day: the king of Babylon set himself against Jerusalem this same day. <sup>3</sup> And utter a parable unto the rebellious house, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Set on a pot, set it on, and also pour water into it: <sup>4</sup> Gather the pieces thereof into it, even every good piece, the thigh, and the shoulder; fill it with the choice bones. <sup>5</sup> Take the choice of the flock, and burn also the bones under it, and make it boil well, and let them seethe the bones of it therein.^*^ <a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70" role="doc-noteref"><sup>70</sup></a></p>
<p><sup>6</sup> Wherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city, to the pot whose scum is therein, and whose scum is not gone out of it! bring it out piece by piece; let no lot fall upon it. <sup>7</sup> For her blood is in the midst of her; she set it upon the top of a rock; she poured it not upon the ground, to cover it with dust; <sup>8</sup> That it might cause fury to come up to take vengeance; I have set her blood upon the top of a rock, that it should not be covered. <sup>9</sup> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city! I will even make the pile for fire great. <sup>10</sup> Heap on wood, kindle the fire, consume the flesh, and spice it well, and let the bones be burned. <sup>11</sup> Then set it empty upon the coals thereof, that the brass of it may be hot, and may burn, and that the filthiness of it may be molten in it, that the scum of it may be consumed. <sup>12</sup> She hath wearied herself with lies, and her great scum went not forth out of her: her scum shall be in the fire. <sup>13</sup> In thy filthiness is lewdness: because I have purged thee, and thou wast not purged, thou shalt not be purged from thy filthiness any more, till I have caused my fury to rest upon thee. <sup>14</sup> I the LORD have spoken it: it shall come to pass, and I will do it; I will not go back, neither will I spare, neither will I repent; according to thy ways, and according to thy doings, shall they judge thee, saith the Lord GOD.</p>

<p><sup>3</sup> Behold, the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches, and with a shadowing shroud, and of an high stature; and his top was among the thick boughs.^*^ <sup>4</sup> The waters made him great, the deep set him up on high with her rivers running round about his plants, and sent out her little rivers unto all the trees of the field.+ 31.4 made…: or, nourished him+ 31.4 set…: or, brought him up+ 31.4 little rivers: or, conduits <sup>5</sup> Therefore his height was exalted above all the trees of the field, and his boughs were multiplied, and his branches became long because of the multitude of waters, when he shot forth.+ 31.5 when…: or, when it sent them forth <sup>6</sup> All the fowls of heaven made their nests in his boughs, and under his branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young, and under his shadow dwelt all great nations. <sup>7</sup> Thus was he fair in his greatness, in the length of his branches: for his root was by great waters. <sup>8</sup> The cedars in the garden of God could not hide him: the fir trees were not like his boughs, and the chesnut trees were not like his branches; nor any tree in the garden of God was like unto him in his beauty. <sup>9</sup> I have made him fair by the multitude of his branches: so that all the trees of Eden, that were in the garden of God, envied him. <a href="#fn89" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref89" role="doc-noteref"><sup>89</sup></a></p>
<p><sup>10</sup> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast lifted up thyself in height, and he hath shot up his top among the thick boughs, and his heart is lifted up in his height; <sup>11</sup> I have therefore delivered him into the hand of the mighty one of the heathen; he shall surely deal with him: I have driven him out for his wickedness.^*^ <sup>12</sup> And strangers, the terrible of the nations, have cut him off, and have left him: upon the mountains and in all the valleys his branches are fallen, and his boughs are broken by all the rivers of the land; and all the people of the earth are gone down from his shadow, and have left him. <sup>13</sup> Upon his ruin shall all the fowls of the heaven remain, and all the beasts of the field shall be upon his branches: <sup>14</sup> To the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves for their height, neither shoot up their top among the thick boughs, neither their trees stand up in their height, all that drink water: for they are all delivered unto death, to the nether parts of the earth, in the midst of the children of men, with them that go down to the pit.+ 31.14 their trees…: or, stand upon themselves for their height <sup>15</sup> Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day when he went down to the grave I caused a mourning: I covered the deep for him, and I restrained the floods thereof, and the great waters were stayed: and I caused Lebanon to mourn for him, and all the trees of the field fainted for him.+ 31.15 to mourn: Heb. to be black <sup>16</sup> I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I cast him down to hell with them that descend into the pit: and all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, shall be comforted in the nether parts of the earth. <sup>17</sup> They also went down into hell with him unto them that be slain with the sword; and they that were his arm, that dwelt under his shadow in the midst of the heathen. <a href="#fn90" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref90" role="doc-noteref"><sup>90</sup></a></p>
<p><sup>18</sup> To whom art thou thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden? yet shalt thou be brought down with the trees of Eden unto the nether parts of the earth: thou shalt lie in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that be slain by the sword. This is Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith the Lord GOD.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, in the first day of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, <sup>2</sup> Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of Egypt, and say unto him, Thou art like a young lion of the nations, and thou art as a whale in the seas: and thou camest forth with thy rivers, and troubledst the waters with thy feet, and fouledst their rivers.^*^ <sup>3</sup> Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will therefore spread out my net over thee with a company of many people; and they shall bring thee up in my net. <sup>4</sup> Then will I leave thee upon the land, I will cast thee forth upon the open field, and will cause all the fowls of the heaven to remain upon thee, and I will fill the beasts of the whole earth with thee. <sup>5</sup> And I will lay thy flesh upon the mountains, and fill the valleys with thy height. <sup>6</sup> I will also water with thy blood the land wherein thou swimmest, even to the mountains; and the rivers shall be full of thee.+ 32.6 the land wherein…: or, the land of thy swimming <sup>7</sup> And when I shall put thee out, I will cover the heaven, and make the stars thereof dark; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not give her light.+ 32.7 put…: or, extinguish thee <sup>8</sup> All the bright lights of heaven will I make dark over thee, and set darkness upon thy land, saith the Lord GOD.+ 32.8 bright…: Heb. lights of the light in heaven+ 32.8 dark: Heb. them dark <sup>9</sup> I will also vex the hearts of many people, when I shall bring thy destruction among the nations, into the countries which thou hast not known.+ 32.9 vex: Heb. provoke to anger, or, grief <sup>10</sup> Yea, I will make many people amazed at thee, and their kings shall be horribly afraid for thee, when I shall brandish my sword before them; and they shall tremble at every moment, every man for his own life, in the day of thy fall. <a href="#fn91" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref91" role="doc-noteref"><sup>91</sup></a></p>
<p><sup>11</sup> For thus saith the Lord GOD; The sword of the king of Babylon shall come upon thee. <sup>12</sup> By the swords of the mighty will I cause thy multitude to fall, the terrible of the nations, all of them: and they shall spoil the pomp of Egypt, and all the multitude thereof shall be destroyed. <sup>13</sup> I will destroy also all the beasts thereof from beside the great waters; neither shall the foot of man trouble them any more, nor the hoofs of beasts trouble them. <sup>14</sup> Then will I make their waters deep, and cause their rivers to run like oil, saith the Lord GOD. <sup>15</sup> When I shall make the land of Egypt desolate, and the country shall be destitute of that whereof it was full, when I shall smite all them that dwell therein, then shall they know that I am the LORD.^*^ <sup>16</sup> This is the lamentation wherewith they shall lament her: the daughters of the nations shall lament her: they shall lament for her, even for Egypt, and for all her multitude, saith the Lord GOD. <a href="#fn92" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref92" role="doc-noteref"><sup>92</sup></a></p>
<p><sup>17</sup> It came to pass also in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth day of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, <sup>18</sup> Son of man, wail for the multitude of Egypt, and cast them down, even her, and the daughters of the famous nations, unto the nether parts of the earth, with them that go down into the pit. <sup>19</sup> Whom dost thou pass in beauty? go down, and be thou laid with the uncircumcised. <sup>20</sup> They shall fall in the midst of them that are slain by the sword: she is delivered to the sword: draw her and all her multitudes.^*^ <sup>21</sup> The strong among the mighty shall speak to him out of the midst of hell with them that help him: they are gone down, they lie uncircumcised, slain by the sword. <sup>22</sup> Asshur is there and all her company: his graves are about him: all of them slain, fallen by the sword: <sup>23</sup> Whose graves are set in the sides of the pit, and her company is round about her grave: all of them slain, fallen by the sword, which caused terror in the land of the living.+ 32.23 terror: or, dismaying <sup>24</sup> There is Elam and all her multitude round about her grave, all of them slain, fallen by the sword, which are gone down uncircumcised into the nether parts of the earth, which caused their terror in the land of the living; yet have they borne their shame with them that go down to the pit. <sup>25</sup> They have set her a bed in the midst of the slain with all her multitude: her graves are round about him: all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword: though their terror was caused in the land of the living, yet have they borne their shame with them that go down to the pit: he is put in the midst of them that be slain. <sup>26</sup> There is Meshech, Tubal, and all her multitude: her graves are round about him: all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword, though they caused their terror in the land of the living. <sup>27</sup> And they shall not lie with the mighty that are fallen of the uncircumcised, which are gone down to hell with their weapons of war: and they have laid their swords under their heads, but their iniquities shall be upon their bones, though they were the terror of the mighty in the land of the living.+ 32.27 with their…: Heb. with weapons of their war <sup>28</sup> Yea, thou shalt be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised, and shalt lie with them that are slain with the sword. <sup>29</sup> There is Edom, her kings, and all her princes, which with their might are laid by them that were slain by the sword: they shall lie with the uncircumcised, and with them that go down to the pit.+ 32.29 laid: Heb. given, or, put <sup>30</sup> There be the princes of the north, all of them, and all the Zidonians, which are gone down with the slain; with their terror they are ashamed of their might; and they lie uncircumcised with them that be slain by the sword, and bear their shame with them that go down to the pit. <sup>31</sup> Pharaoh shall see them, and shall be comforted over all his multitude, even Pharaoh and all his army slain by the sword, saith the Lord GOD. <sup>32</sup> For I have caused my terror in the land of the living: and he shall be laid in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that are slain with the sword, even Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith the Lord GOD. <a href="#fn93" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref93" role="doc-noteref"><sup>93</sup></a></p>
<h1 id="section-32">33</h1>
<p><sup>1</sup> Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, <sup>2</sup> Son of man, speak to the children of thy people, and say unto them, When I bring the sword upon a land, if the people of the land take a man of their coasts, and set him for their watchman:^*^ <sup>3</sup> If when he seeth the sword come upon the land, he blow the trumpet, and warn the people; <sup>4</sup> Then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet, and taketh not warning; if the sword come, and take him away, his blood shall be upon his own head.+ 33.4 whosoever…: Heb. he that hearing heareth <sup>5</sup> He heard the sound of the trumpet, and took not warning; his blood shall be upon him. But he that taketh warning shall deliver his soul. <sup>6</sup> But if the watchman see the sword come, and blow not the trumpet, and the people be not warned; if the sword come, and take any person from among them, he is taken away in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at the watchman’s hand. <a href="#fn94" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref94" role="doc-noteref"><sup>94</sup></a></p>
<p><sup>7</sup> So thou, O son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth, and warn them from me. <sup>8</sup> When I say unto the wicked, O wicked man, thou shalt surely die; if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand. <sup>9</sup> Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it; if he do not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.</p>
<p><sup>10</sup> Therefore, O thou son of man, speak unto the house of Israel; Thus ye speak, saying, If our transgressions and our sins be upon us, and we pine away in them, how should we then live? <sup>11</sup> Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel? <sup>12</sup> Therefore, thou son of man, say unto the children of thy people, The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression: as for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turneth from his wickedness; neither shall the righteous be able to live for his righteousness in the day that he sinneth. <sup>13</sup> When I shall say to the righteous, that he shall surely live; if he trust to his own righteousness, and commit iniquity, all his righteousnesses shall not be remembered; but for his iniquity that he hath committed, he shall die for it. <sup>14</sup> Again, when I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; if he turn from his sin, and do that which is lawful and right;^*^ <sup>15</sup> If the wicked restore the pledge, give again that he had robbed, walk in the statutes of life, without committing iniquity; he shall surely live, he shall not die. <sup>16</sup> None of his sins that he hath committed shall be mentioned unto him: he hath done that which is lawful and right; he shall surely live. <a href="#fn95" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref95" role="doc-noteref"><sup>95</sup></a></p>
<p><sup>17</sup> Yet the children of thy people say, The way of the Lord is not equal: but as for them, their way is not equal. <sup>18</sup> When the righteous turneth from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, he shall even die thereby. <sup>19</sup> But if the wicked turn from his wickedness, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall live thereby.</p>
<p><sup>20</sup> Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not equal. O ye house of Israel, I will judge you every one after his ways.</p>
<p><sup>21</sup> And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the tenth month, in the fifth day of the month, that one that had escaped out of Jerusalem came unto me, saying, The city is smitten. <sup>22</sup> Now the hand of the LORD was upon me in the evening, afore he that was escaped came; and had opened my mouth, until he came to me in the morning; and my mouth was opened, and I was no more dumb. <sup>23</sup> Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, <sup>24</sup> Son of man, they that inhabit those wastes of the land of Israel speak, saying, Abraham was one, and he inherited the land: but we are many; the land is given us for inheritance. <sup>25</sup> Wherefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Ye eat with the blood, and lift up your eyes toward your idols, and shed blood: and shall ye possess the land? <sup>26</sup> Ye stand upon your sword, ye work abomination, and ye defile every one his neighbour’s wife: and shall ye possess the land? <sup>27</sup> Say thou thus unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; As I live, surely they that are in the wastes shall fall by the sword, and him that is in the open field will I give to the beasts to be devoured, and they that be in the forts and in the caves shall die of the pestilence.^*^ <sup>28</sup> For I will lay the land most desolate, and the pomp of her strength shall cease; and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate, that none shall pass through.+ 33.28 most…: Heb. desolation and desolation <sup>29</sup> Then shall they know that I am the LORD, when I have laid the land most desolate because of all their abominations which they have committed. <a href="#fn96" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref96" role="doc-noteref"><sup>96</sup></a></p>
<p><sup>30</sup> Also, thou son of man, the children of thy people still are talking against thee by the walls and in the doors of the houses, and speak one to another, every one to his brother, saying, Come, I pray you, and hear what is the word that cometh forth from the LORD.^*^ <sup>31</sup> And they come unto thee as the people cometh, and they sit before thee as my people, and they hear thy words, but they will not do them: for with their mouth they shew much love, but their heart goeth after their covetousness.+ 33.31 as the…: Heb. according to the coming of the people+ 33.31 they sit…: or, my people sit before thee+ 33.31 they shew…: Heb. they make loves, or, jests <sup>32</sup> And, lo, thou art unto them as a very lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice, and can play well on an instrument: for they hear thy words, but they do them not.+ 33.32 a very…: Heb. a song of loves <sup>33</sup> And when this cometh to pass, (lo, it will come,) then shall they know that a prophet hath been among them. <a href="#fn97" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref97" role="doc-noteref"><sup>97</sup></a></p>
<h1 id="section-33">34</h1>
<p><sup>1</sup> And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, <sup>2</sup> Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD unto the shepherds; Woe be to the shepherds of Israel that do feed themselves! should not the shepherds feed the flocks? <sup>3</sup> Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the wool, ye kill them that are fed: but ye feed not the flock. <sup>4</sup> The diseased have ye not strengthened, neither have ye healed that which was sick, neither have ye bound up that which was broken, neither have ye brought again that which was driven away, neither have ye sought that which was lost; but with force and with cruelty have ye ruled them. <sup>5</sup> And they were scattered, because there is no shepherd: and they became meat to all the beasts of the field, when they were scattered.^*^ <sup>6</sup> My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and upon every high hill: yea, my flock was scattered upon all the face of the earth, and none did search or seek after them. <a href="#fn98" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref98" role="doc-noteref"><sup>98</sup></a></p>
<p><sup>7</sup> Therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of the LORD; <sup>8</sup> As I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely because my flock became a prey, and my flock became meat to every beast of the field, because there was no shepherd, neither did my shepherds search for my flock, but the shepherds fed themselves, and fed not my flock;^*^ <sup>9</sup> Therefore, O ye shepherds, hear the word of the LORD; <sup>10</sup> Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against the shepherds; and I will require my flock at their hand, and cause them to cease from feeding the flock; neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any more; for I will deliver my flock from their mouth, that they may not be meat for them. <a href="#fn99" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref99" role="doc-noteref"><sup>99</sup></a></p>
<p><sup>11</sup> For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I, even I, will both search my sheep, and seek them out. <sup>12</sup> As a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are scattered; so will I seek out my sheep, and will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day.^*^ <sup>13</sup> And I will bring them out from the people, and gather them from the countries, and will bring them to their own land, and feed them upon the mountains of Israel by the rivers, and in all the inhabited places of the country. <sup>14</sup> I will feed them in a good pasture, and upon the high mountains of Israel shall their fold be: there shall they lie in a good fold, and in a fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of Israel. <sup>15</sup> I will feed my flock, and I will cause them to lie down, saith the Lord GOD. <sup>16</sup> I will seek that which was lost, and bring again that which was driven away, and will bind up that which was broken, and will strengthen that which was sick: but I will destroy the fat and the strong; I will feed them with judgment. <a href="#fn100" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref100" role="doc-noteref"><sup>100</sup></a></p>
<p><sup>17</sup> And as for you, O my flock, thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I judge between cattle and cattle, between the rams and the he goats.^*^+ 34.17 he goats: Heb. great he goats <sup>18</sup> Seemeth it a small thing unto you to have eaten up the good pasture, but ye must tread down with your feet the residue of your pastures? and to have drunk of the deep waters, but ye must foul the residue with your feet? <sup>19</sup> And as for my flock, they eat that which ye have trodden with your feet; and they drink that which ye have fouled with your feet. <a href="#fn101" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref101" role="doc-noteref"><sup>101</sup></a></p>
<p><sup>20</sup> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD unto them; Behold, I, even I, will judge between the fat cattle and between the lean cattle. <sup>21</sup> Because ye have thrust with side and with shoulder, and pushed all the diseased with your horns, till ye have scattered them abroad; <sup>22</sup> Therefore will I save my flock, and they shall no more be a prey; and I will judge between cattle and cattle. <sup>23</sup> And I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, even my servant David; he shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd. <sup>24</sup> And I the LORD will be their God, and my servant David a prince among them; I the LORD have spoken it. <sup>25</sup> And I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause the evil beasts to cease out of the land: and they shall dwell safely in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods. <sup>26</sup> And I will make them and the places round about my hill a blessing; and I will cause the shower to come down in his season; there shall be showers of blessing. <sup>27</sup> And the tree of the field shall yield her fruit, and the earth shall yield her increase, and they shall be safe in their land, and shall know that I am the LORD, when I have broken the bands of their yoke, and delivered them out of the hand of those that served themselves of them. <sup>28</sup> And they shall no more be a prey to the heathen, neither shall the beast of the land devour them; but they shall dwell safely, and none shall make them afraid. <sup>29</sup> And I will raise up for them a plant of renown, and they shall be no more consumed with hunger in the land, neither bear the shame of the heathen any more.^*^+ 34.29 consumed: Heb. taken away <sup>30</sup> Thus shall they know that I the LORD their God am with them, and that they, even the house of Israel, are my people, saith the Lord GOD. <sup>31</sup> And ye my flock, the flock of my pasture, are men, and I am your God, saith the Lord GOD. <a href="#fn102" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref102" role="doc-noteref"><sup>102</sup></a></p>

<p><sup>1</sup> Afterward he brought me to the temple, and measured the posts, six cubits broad on the one side, and six cubits broad on the other side, which was the breadth of the tabernacle. <sup>2</sup> And the breadth of the door was ten cubits; and the sides of the door were five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on the other side: and he measured the length thereof, forty cubits: and the breadth, twenty cubits.^*^ <sup>3</sup> Then went he inward, and measured the post of the door, two cubits; and the door, six cubits; and the breadth of the door, seven cubits. <sup>4</sup> So he measured the length thereof, twenty cubits; and the breadth, twenty cubits, before the temple: and he said unto me, This is the most holy place. <sup>5</sup> After he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the breadth of every side chamber, four cubits, round about the house on every side. <sup>6</sup> And the side chambers were three, one over another, and thirty in order; and they entered into the wall which was of the house for the side chambers round about, that they might have hold, but they had not hold in the wall of the house.+ 41.6 one…: Heb. side chamber over side chamber+ 41.6 thirty…: or, three and thirty times, or, foot+ 41.6 have hold: Heb. be holden <sup>7</sup> And there was an enlarging, and a winding about still upward to the side chambers: for the winding about of the house went still upward round about the house: therefore the breadth of the house was still upward, and so increased from the lowest chamber to the highest by the midst.+ 41.7 there…: Heb. it was made broader, and went round <sup>8</sup> I saw also the height of the house round about: the foundations of the side chambers were a full reed of six great cubits. <sup>9</sup> The thickness of the wall, which was for the side chamber without, was five cubits: and that which was left was the place of the side chambers that were within. <sup>10</sup> And between the chambers was the wideness of twenty cubits round about the house on every side. <sup>11</sup> And the doors of the side chambers were toward the place that was left, one door toward the north, and another door toward the south: and the breadth of the place that was left was five cubits round about. <a href="#fn124" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref124" role="doc-noteref"><sup>124</sup></a></p>
<p><sup>12</sup> Now the building that was before the separate place at the end toward the west was seventy cubits broad; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick round about, and the length thereof ninety cubits. <sup>13</sup> So he measured the house, an hundred cubits long; and the separate place, and the building, with the walls thereof, an hundred cubits long; <sup>14</sup> Also the breadth of the face of the house, and of the separate place toward the east, an hundred cubits. <sup>15</sup> And he measured the length of the building over against the separate place which was behind it, and the galleries thereof on the one side and on the other side, an hundred cubits, with the inner temple, and the porches of the court;^*^ <sup>16</sup> The door posts, and the narrow windows, and the galleries round about on their three stories, over against the door, cieled with wood round about, and from the ground up to the windows, and the windows were covered;+ 41.16 cieled…: Heb. cieling of wood+ 41.16 and from…: or, and the ground unto the windows <sup>17</sup> To that above the door, even unto the inner house, and without, and by all the wall round about within and without, by measure.+ 41.17 measure: Heb. measures <sup>18</sup> And it was made with cherubims and palm trees, so that a palm tree was between a cherub and a cherub; and every cherub had two faces; <sup>19</sup> So that the face of a man was toward the palm tree on the one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side: it was made through all the house round about. <sup>20</sup> From the ground unto above the door were cherubims and palm trees made, and on the wall of the temple. <sup>21</sup> The posts of the temple were squared, and the face of the sanctuary; the appearance of the one as the appearance of the other.+ 41.21 posts: Heb. post <sup>22</sup> The altar of wood was three cubits high, and the length thereof two cubits; and the corners thereof, and the length thereof, and the walls thereof, were of wood: and he said unto me, This is the table that is before the LORD. <sup>23</sup> And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors. <sup>24</sup> And the doors had two leaves apiece, two turning leaves; two leaves for the one door, and two leaves for the other door. <sup>25</sup> And there were made on them, on the doors of the temple, cherubims and palm trees, like as were made upon the walls; and there were thick planks upon the face of the porch without. <sup>26</sup> And there were narrow windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side, on the sides of the porch, and upon the side chambers of the house, and thick planks. <a href="#fn125" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref125" role="doc-noteref"><sup>125</sup></a></p>

<p><sup>13</sup> Then said he unto me, The north chambers and the south chambers, which are before the separate place, they be holy chambers, where the priests that approach unto the LORD shall eat the most holy things: there shall they lay the most holy things, and the meat offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering; for the place is holy. <sup>14</sup> When the priests enter therein, then shall they not go out of the holy place into the utter court, but there they shall lay their garments wherein they minister; for they are holy; and shall put on other garments, and shall approach to those things which are for the people.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> Afterward he brought me to the gate, even the gate that looketh toward the east: <sup>2</sup> And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east: and his voice was like a noise of many waters: and the earth shined with his glory. <sup>3</sup> And it was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw, even according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city: and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell upon my face.^*^ <sup>4</sup> And the glory of the LORD came into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east. <sup>5</sup> So the spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court; and, behold, the glory of the LORD filled the house. <sup>6</sup> And I heard him speaking unto me out of the house; and the man stood by me. <a href="#fn128" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref128" role="doc-noteref"><sup>128</sup></a></p>

<p><sup>19</sup> After he brought me through the entry, which was at the side of the gate, into the holy chambers of the priests, which looked toward the north: and, behold, there was a place on the two sides westward. <sup>20</sup> Then said he unto me, This is the place where the priests shall boil the trespass offering and the sin offering, where they shall bake the meat offering; that they bear them not out into the utter court, to sanctify the people. <sup>21</sup> Then he brought me forth into the utter court, and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court; and, behold, in every corner of the court there was a court.^*^ <sup>22</sup> In the four corners of the court there were courts joined of forty cubits long and thirty broad: these four corners were of one measure.+ 46.22 joined: or, made with chimneys+ 46.22 corners were…: Heb. cornered, etc <sup>23</sup> And there was a row of building round about in them, round about them four, and it was made with boiling places under the rows round about. <sup>24</sup> Then said he unto me, These are the places of them that boil, where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifice of the people. <a href="#fn141" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref141" role="doc-noteref"><sup>141</sup></a></p>
