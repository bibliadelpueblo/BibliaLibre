<p><sup class='bibleverse'>1</sup> Now it came to pass after this, that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his stead. <sup class='bibleverse'>2</sup> And David said, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father shewed kindness to me. And David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father.

And he sent to meet them: for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>6</sup> And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Syria-maachah, and out of Zobah.<a href="#fn149" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref149" role="doc-noteref"><sup>149</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>7</sup> So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of Maachah and his people; who came and pitched before Medeba.

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>16</sup> And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians that were beyond the river: and Shophach the captain of the host of Hadarezer went before them.<sup>[<strong>19:16</strong> river: that is, Euphrates]</sup>[<strong>19:16</strong> Shophach: also called, Shobach] <sup class='bibleverse'>17</sup> And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel, and passed over Jordan, and came upon them, and set the battle in array against them.

<h1 id="section-19">20</h1>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>1</sup> And it came to pass, that after the year was expired, at the time that kings go out to battle, Joab led forth the power of the army, and wasted the country of the children of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah.

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>4</sup> And it came to pass after this, that there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines; at which time Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Sippai, that was of the children of the giant: and they were subdued.<sup>[<strong>20:4</strong> arose: or, continued: Heb. stood]</sup>[<strong>20:4</strong> Gezer: also called, Gob]<sup>[<strong>20:4</strong> Sippai: also called, Saph]</sup>[<strong>20:4</strong> the giant: or, Rapha] <sup class='bibleverse'>5</sup> And there was war again with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, whose spear staff was like a weaver’s beam.<a href="#fn153" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref153" role="doc-noteref"><sup>153</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>6</sup> And yet again there was war at Gath, where was a man of great stature, whose fingers and toes were four and twenty, six on each hand, and six on each foot: and he also was the son of the giant.<sup>[<strong>20:6</strong> great…: Heb. measure]</sup>[<strong>20:6</strong> the son…: Heb. born to the giant, or, Rapha] <sup class='bibleverse'>7</sup> But when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea David’s brother slew him.<sup>[<strong>20:7</strong> defied: or, reproached]</sup>[<strong>20:7</strong> Shimea: also called Shammah] <sup class='bibleverse'>8</sup> These were born unto the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.</p>

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>1</sup> And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number Israel. <sup class='bibleverse'>2</sup> And David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people, Go, number Israel from Beer-sheba even to Dan; and bring the number of them to me, that I may know it. <sup class='bibleverse'>3</sup> And Joab answered, The LORD make his people an hundred times so many more as they be: but, my lord the king, are they not all my lord’s servants? why then doth my lord require this thing? why will he be a cause of trespass to Israel? <sup class='bibleverse'>4</sup> Nevertheless the king’s word prevailed against Joab. Wherefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>5</sup> And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David. And all they of Israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred thousand men that drew sword: and Judah was four hundred threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword. <sup class='bibleverse'>6</sup> But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them: for the king’s word was abominable to Joab.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>7</sup> And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote Israel.<a href="#fn154" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref154" role="doc-noteref"><sup>154</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>8</sup> And David said unto God, I have sinned greatly, because I have done this thing: but now, I beseech thee, do away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>9</sup> And the LORD spake unto Gad, David’s seer, saying, <sup class='bibleverse'>10</sup> Go and tell David, saying, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee three things: choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee.<a href="#fn155" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref155" role="doc-noteref"><sup>155</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>11</sup> So Gad came to David, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Choose thee<a href="#fn156" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref156" role="doc-noteref"><sup>156</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>12</sup> Either three years’ famine; or three months to be destroyed before thy foes, while that the sword of thine enemies overtaketh thee; or else three days the sword of the LORD, even the pestilence, in the land, and the angel of the LORD destroying throughout all the coasts of Israel. Now therefore advise thyself what word I shall bring again to him that sent me. <sup class='bibleverse'>13</sup> And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall now into the hand of the LORD; for very great are his mercies: but let me not fall into the hand of man.<a href="#fn157" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref157" role="doc-noteref"><sup>157</sup></a></p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>14</sup> So the LORD sent pestilence upon Israel: and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men. <sup class='bibleverse'>15</sup> And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was destroying, the LORD beheld, and he repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed, It is enough, stay now thine hand.

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>18</sup> Then the angel of the LORD commanded Gad to say to David, that David should go up, and set up an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite. <sup class='bibleverse'>19</sup> And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spake in the name of the LORD. <sup class='bibleverse'>20</sup> And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons with him hid themselves.

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>28</sup> At that time when David saw that the LORD had answered him in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there. <sup class='bibleverse'>29</sup> For the tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of the burnt offering, were at that season in the high place at Gibeon. <sup class='bibleverse'>30</sup> But David could not go before it to enquire of God: for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of the LORD.</p>
<h1 id="section-21">22</h1>

<p><sup class='bibleverse'>6</sup> Then the chief of the fathers and princes of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers of the king’s work, offered willingly, <sup class='bibleverse'>7</sup> And gave for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand drams, and of silver ten thousand talents, and of brass eighteen thousand talents, and one hundred thousand talents of iron. <sup class='bibleverse'>8</sup> And they with whom precious stones were found gave them to the treasure of the house of the LORD, by the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite. <sup class='bibleverse'>9</sup> Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered willingly, because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the LORD: and David the king also rejoiced with great joy.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>10</sup> Wherefore David blessed the LORD before all the congregation: and David said, Blessed be thou, LORD God of Israel our father, for ever and ever. <sup class='bibleverse'>11</sup> Thine, O LORD, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is thine; thine is the kingdom, O LORD, and thou art exalted as head above all. <sup class='bibleverse'>12</sup> Both riches and honour come of thee, and thou reignest over all; and in thine hand is power and might; and in thine hand it is to make great, and to give strength unto all. <sup class='bibleverse'>13</sup> Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious name. <sup class='bibleverse'>14</sup> But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? for all things come of thee, and of thine own have we given thee.<sup>[<strong>29:14</strong> be able: Heb. retain, or, obtain strength]</sup>[<strong>29:14</strong> of thine…: Heb. of thine hand] <sup class='bibleverse'>15</sup> For we are strangers before thee, and sojourners, as were all our fathers: our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is none abiding.<a href="#fn201" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref201" role="doc-noteref"><sup>201</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>16</sup> O LORD our God, all this store that we have prepared to build thee an house for thine holy name cometh of thine hand, and is all thine own. <sup class='bibleverse'>17</sup> I know also, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of mine heart I have willingly offered all these things: and now have I seen with joy thy people, which are present here, to offer willingly unto thee.<a href="#fn202" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref202" role="doc-noteref"><sup>202</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>18</sup> O LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people, and prepare their heart unto thee:<a href="#fn203" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref203" role="doc-noteref"><sup>203</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>19</sup> And give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and to do all these things, and to build the palace, for the which I have made provision.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>20</sup> And David said to all the congregation, Now bless the LORD your God. And all the congregation blessed the LORD God of their fathers, and bowed down their heads, and worshipped the LORD, and the king. <sup class='bibleverse'>21</sup> And they sacrificed sacrifices unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings unto the LORD, on the morrow after that day, even a thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, and a thousand lambs, with their drink offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel: <sup class='bibleverse'>22</sup> And did eat and drink before the LORD on that day with great gladness. And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed him unto the LORD to be the chief governor, and Zadok to be priest.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>23</sup> Then Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him. <sup class='bibleverse'>24</sup> And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons likewise of king David, submitted themselves unto Solomon the king.<a href="#fn204" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref204" role="doc-noteref"><sup>204</sup></a> <sup class='bibleverse'>25</sup> And the LORD magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>26</sup> Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel. <sup class='bibleverse'>27</sup> And the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years; seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem. <sup class='bibleverse'>28</sup> And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honour: and Solomon his son reigned in his stead. <sup class='bibleverse'>29</sup> Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer,+ 29.29 book: or, history: Heb. words <sup class='bibleverse'>30</sup> With all his reign and his might, and the times that went over him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the countries.</p>
