<p><sup class='bibleverse'>1</sup> The elder unto the wellbeloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>2</sup> Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth. <sup class='bibleverse'>3</sup> For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth. <sup class='bibleverse'>4</sup> I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth. <sup class='bibleverse'>5</sup> Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren, and to strangers; <sup class='bibleverse'>6</sup> Which have borne witness of thy charity before the church: whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, thou shalt do well: <sup class='bibleverse'>7</sup> Because that for his nameâ€™s sake they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles. <sup class='bibleverse'>8</sup> We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be fellowhelpers to the truth.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>9</sup> I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not. <sup class='bibleverse'>10</sup> Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doeth, prating against us with malicious words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth them out of the church.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>11</sup> Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil hath not seen God. <sup class='bibleverse'>12</sup> Demetrius hath good report of all men, and of the truth itself: yea, and we also bear record; and ye know that our record is true.</p>
<p><sup class='bibleverse'>13</sup> I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write unto thee: <sup class='bibleverse'>14</sup> But I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak face to face. Peace be to thee. Our friends salute thee. Greet the friends by name.</p>
