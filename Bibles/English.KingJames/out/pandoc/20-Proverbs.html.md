<sup class='bibleverse'>1</sup> The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel; <sup class='bibleverse'>2</sup> To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding; <sup class='bibleverse'>3</sup> To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity;^[**1:3** equity: Heb. equities] <sup class='bibleverse'>4</sup> To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion.^[**1:4** discretion: or, advisement] <sup class='bibleverse'>5</sup> A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels: <sup class='bibleverse'>6</sup> To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings.^[**1:6** the interpretation: or, an eloquent speech] 




<sup class='bibleverse'>7</sup> The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction.^[**1:7** the beginning: or, the principal part] <sup class='bibleverse'>8</sup> My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother: <sup class='bibleverse'>9</sup> For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck.^[**1:9** an…: Heb. an adding] 



<sup class='bibleverse'>10</sup> My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not. <sup class='bibleverse'>11</sup> If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause: <sup class='bibleverse'>12</sup> Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit: <sup class='bibleverse'>13</sup> We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil: <sup class='bibleverse'>14</sup> Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse: <sup class='bibleverse'>15</sup> My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path: <sup class='bibleverse'>16</sup> For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood. <sup class='bibleverse'>17</sup> Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.^[**1:17** in the…: Heb. in the eyes of every thing that hath a wing] <sup class='bibleverse'>18</sup> And they lay wait for their own blood; they lurk privily for their own lives. <sup class='bibleverse'>19</sup> So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; which taketh away the life of the owners thereof. 


<sup class='bibleverse'>20</sup> Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets:^[**1:20** Wisdom: Heb. Wisdoms, that is, Excellent wisdom] <sup class='bibleverse'>21</sup> She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, saying, <sup class='bibleverse'>22</sup> How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge? <sup class='bibleverse'>23</sup> Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you. 


<sup class='bibleverse'>24</sup> Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded; <sup class='bibleverse'>25</sup> But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof: <sup class='bibleverse'>26</sup> I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh; <sup class='bibleverse'>27</sup> When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you. <sup class='bibleverse'>28</sup> Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me: <sup class='bibleverse'>29</sup> For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD: <sup class='bibleverse'>30</sup> They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof. <sup class='bibleverse'>31</sup> Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices. <sup class='bibleverse'>32</sup> For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.^[**1:32** turning…: or, ease of the simple] <sup class='bibleverse'>33</sup> But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.

<sup class='bibleverse'>1</sup> My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandments with thee; <sup class='bibleverse'>2</sup> So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, and apply thine heart to understanding; <sup class='bibleverse'>3</sup> Yea, if thou criest after knowledge, and liftest up thy voice for understanding;^[**2:3** liftest…: Heb. givest thy voice] <sup class='bibleverse'>4</sup> If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as for hid treasures; <sup class='bibleverse'>5</sup> Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge of God. <sup class='bibleverse'>6</sup> For the LORD giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding. <sup class='bibleverse'>7</sup> He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: he is a buckler to them that walk uprightly. <sup class='bibleverse'>8</sup> He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his saints. <sup class='bibleverse'>9</sup> Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and equity; yea, every good path. 


<sup class='bibleverse'>10</sup> When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul; <sup class='bibleverse'>11</sup> Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee: <sup class='bibleverse'>12</sup> To deliver thee from the way of the evil man, from the man that speaketh froward things; <sup class='bibleverse'>13</sup> Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness; <sup class='bibleverse'>14</sup> Who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the frowardness of the wicked; <sup class='bibleverse'>15</sup> Whose ways are crooked, and they froward in their paths: <sup class='bibleverse'>16</sup> To deliver thee from the strange woman, even from the stranger which flattereth with her words; <sup class='bibleverse'>17</sup> Which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God. <sup class='bibleverse'>18</sup> For her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead. <sup class='bibleverse'>19</sup> None that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of the paths of life. <sup class='bibleverse'>20</sup> That thou mayest walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths of the righteous. <sup class='bibleverse'>21</sup> For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it. <sup class='bibleverse'>22</sup> But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it.^[**2:22** rooted: or, plucked up]

<sup class='bibleverse'>1</sup> My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my commandments: <sup class='bibleverse'>2</sup> For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to thee.^[**3:2** long…: Heb. years of life] <sup class='bibleverse'>3</sup> Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck; write them upon the table of thine heart: <sup class='bibleverse'>4</sup> So shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight of God and man.^[**3:4** good…: or, good success] 



<sup class='bibleverse'>5</sup> Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. <sup class='bibleverse'>6</sup> In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths. 

<sup class='bibleverse'>7</sup> Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from evil. <sup class='bibleverse'>8</sup> It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.^[**3:8** health: Heb. medicine]^[**3:8** marrow: Heb. watering, or, moistening] <sup class='bibleverse'>9</sup> Honour the LORD with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase: <sup class='bibleverse'>10</sup> So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine. 



<sup class='bibleverse'>11</sup> My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; neither be weary of his correction: <sup class='bibleverse'>12</sup> For whom the LORD loveth he correcteth; even as a father the son in whom he delighteth. 

<sup class='bibleverse'>13</sup> Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth understanding.^[**3:13** that getteth…: Heb. that draweth out understanding] <sup class='bibleverse'>14</sup> For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold. <sup class='bibleverse'>15</sup> She is more precious than rubies: and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her. <sup class='bibleverse'>16</sup> Length of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand riches and honour. <sup class='bibleverse'>17</sup> Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace. <sup class='bibleverse'>18</sup> She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy is every one that retaineth her. <sup class='bibleverse'>19</sup> The LORD by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding hath he established the heavens.^[**3:19** established: or, prepared] <sup class='bibleverse'>20</sup> By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew. 



<sup class='bibleverse'>21</sup> My son, let not them depart from thine eyes: keep sound wisdom and discretion: <sup class='bibleverse'>22</sup> So shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy neck. <sup class='bibleverse'>23</sup> Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble. <sup class='bibleverse'>24</sup> When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet. <sup class='bibleverse'>25</sup> Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh. <sup class='bibleverse'>26</sup> For the LORD shall be thy confidence, and shall keep thy foot from being taken. 

<sup class='bibleverse'>27</sup> Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do it.^[**3:27** them…: Heb. the owners thereof] <sup class='bibleverse'>28</sup> Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and to morrow I will give; when thou hast it by thee. <sup class='bibleverse'>29</sup> Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth securely by thee.^[**3:29** Devise…: or, Practise no evil] 



<sup class='bibleverse'>30</sup> Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee no harm. 

<sup class='bibleverse'>31</sup> Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways.^[**3:31** the oppressor: Heb. a man of violence] <sup class='bibleverse'>32</sup> For the froward is abomination to the LORD: but his secret is with the righteous. 


<sup class='bibleverse'>33</sup> The curse of the LORD is in the house of the wicked: but he blesseth the habitation of the just. <sup class='bibleverse'>34</sup> Surely he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth grace unto the lowly. <sup class='bibleverse'>35</sup> The wise shall inherit glory: but shame shall be the promotion of fools.^[**3:35** shall be…: Heb. exalteth the fools]
 

# 4 
<sup class='bibleverse'>1</sup> Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding. <sup class='bibleverse'>2</sup> For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law. <sup class='bibleverse'>3</sup> For I was my father’s son, tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother. <sup class='bibleverse'>4</sup> He taught me also, and said unto me, Let thine heart retain my words: keep my commandments, and live. <sup class='bibleverse'>5</sup> Get wisdom, get understanding: forget it not; neither decline from the words of my mouth. <sup class='bibleverse'>6</sup> Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee: love her, and she shall keep thee. <sup class='bibleverse'>7</sup> Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding. <sup class='bibleverse'>8</sup> Exalt her, and she shall promote thee: she shall bring thee to honour, when thou dost embrace her. <sup class='bibleverse'>9</sup> She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace: a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee.^[**4:9** a crown…: or, she shall compass thee with a crown of glory] <sup class='bibleverse'>10</sup> Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of thy life shall be many. <sup class='bibleverse'>11</sup> I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in right paths. <sup class='bibleverse'>12</sup> When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; and when thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble. <sup class='bibleverse'>13</sup> Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go: keep her; for she is thy life. 


<sup class='bibleverse'>14</sup> Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil men. <sup class='bibleverse'>15</sup> Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away. <sup class='bibleverse'>16</sup> For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall. <sup class='bibleverse'>17</sup> For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence. <sup class='bibleverse'>18</sup> But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day. <sup class='bibleverse'>19</sup> The way of the wicked is as darkness: they know not at what they stumble. 

<sup class='bibleverse'>20</sup> My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings. <sup class='bibleverse'>21</sup> Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of thine heart. <sup class='bibleverse'>22</sup> For they are life unto those that find them, and health to all their flesh.^[**4:22** health: Heb. medicine] 


<sup class='bibleverse'>23</sup> Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life.^[**4:23** with…: Heb. above all keeping] <sup class='bibleverse'>24</sup> Put away from thee a froward mouth, and perverse lips put far from thee.^[**4:24** a froward…: Heb. frowardness of mouth and perverseness of lips] <sup class='bibleverse'>25</sup> Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight before thee. <sup class='bibleverse'>26</sup> Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established.^[**4:26** let…: or, all thy ways shall be ordered aright] <sup class='bibleverse'>27</sup> Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove thy foot from evil.


 

# 5 
<sup class='bibleverse'>1</sup> My son, attend unto my wisdom, and bow thine ear to my understanding: <sup class='bibleverse'>2</sup> That thou mayest regard discretion, and that thy lips may keep knowledge. 

<sup class='bibleverse'>3</sup> For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her mouth is smoother than oil:^[**5:3** mouth: Heb. palate] <sup class='bibleverse'>4</sup> But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a twoedged sword. <sup class='bibleverse'>5</sup> Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell. <sup class='bibleverse'>6</sup> Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are moveable, that thou canst not know them. <sup class='bibleverse'>7</sup> Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the words of my mouth. <sup class='bibleverse'>8</sup> Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her house: <sup class='bibleverse'>9</sup> Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto the cruel: <sup class='bibleverse'>10</sup> Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labours be in the house of a stranger;^[**5:10** thy wealth: Heb. thy strength] <sup class='bibleverse'>11</sup> And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed, <sup class='bibleverse'>12</sup> And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof; <sup class='bibleverse'>13</sup> And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me! <sup class='bibleverse'>14</sup> I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly. 



<sup class='bibleverse'>15</sup> Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well. <sup class='bibleverse'>16</sup> Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in the streets. <sup class='bibleverse'>17</sup> Let them be only thine own, and not strangers’ with thee. <sup class='bibleverse'>18</sup> Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth. <sup class='bibleverse'>19</sup> Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love.^[**5:19** satisfy…: Heb. water thee]^[**5:19** be thou…: Heb. err thou always in her love] <sup class='bibleverse'>20</sup> And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger? <sup class='bibleverse'>21</sup> For the ways of man are before the eyes of the LORD, and he pondereth all his goings. 



<sup class='bibleverse'>22</sup> His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins.^[**5:22** sins: Heb. sin] <sup class='bibleverse'>23</sup> He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.

<sup class='bibleverse'>1</sup> My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, if thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger, <sup class='bibleverse'>2</sup> Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth. <sup class='bibleverse'>3</sup> Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, when thou art come into the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure thy friend.^[**6:3** and make…: or, so shalt thou prevail with thy friend] <sup class='bibleverse'>4</sup> Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids. <sup class='bibleverse'>5</sup> Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler. 


<sup class='bibleverse'>6</sup> Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise: <sup class='bibleverse'>7</sup> Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler, <sup class='bibleverse'>8</sup> Provideth her meat in the summer, and gathereth her food in the harvest. <sup class='bibleverse'>9</sup> How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep? <sup class='bibleverse'>10</sup> Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep: <sup class='bibleverse'>11</sup> So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man. 

<sup class='bibleverse'>12</sup> A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth. <sup class='bibleverse'>13</sup> He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth with his fingers; <sup class='bibleverse'>14</sup> Frowardness is in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually; he soweth discord.^[**6:14** soweth: Heb. casteth forth] <sup class='bibleverse'>15</sup> Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be broken without remedy. 


<sup class='bibleverse'>16</sup> These six things doth the LORD hate: yea, seven are an abomination unto him:^[**6:16** unto…: Heb. of his soul] <sup class='bibleverse'>17</sup> A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,^[**6:17** A proud…: Heb. Haughty eyes] <sup class='bibleverse'>18</sup> An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief, <sup class='bibleverse'>19</sup> A false witness that speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren. 



<sup class='bibleverse'>20</sup> My son, keep thy father’s commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother: <sup class='bibleverse'>21</sup> Bind them continually upon thine heart, and tie them about thy neck. <sup class='bibleverse'>22</sup> When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee. <sup class='bibleverse'>23</sup> For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life:^[**6:23** lamp: or, candle] <sup class='bibleverse'>24</sup> To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.^[**6:24** of the…: or, of the strange tongue] <sup class='bibleverse'>25</sup> Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids. <sup class='bibleverse'>26</sup> For by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread: and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life.^[**6:26** the adulteress: Heb. the woman of a man, or, a man’s wife] <sup class='bibleverse'>27</sup> Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned? <sup class='bibleverse'>28</sup> Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned? <sup class='bibleverse'>29</sup> So he that goeth in to his neighbour’s wife; whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent. <sup class='bibleverse'>30</sup> Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry; <sup class='bibleverse'>31</sup> But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house. <sup class='bibleverse'>32</sup> But whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding: he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul.^[**6:32** understanding: Heb. heart] <sup class='bibleverse'>33</sup> A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away. <sup class='bibleverse'>34</sup> For jealousy is the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance. <sup class='bibleverse'>35</sup> He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.^[**6:35** He will…: Heb.

<sup class='bibleverse'>1</sup> My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee. <sup class='bibleverse'>2</sup> Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thine eye. <sup class='bibleverse'>3</sup> Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine heart. <sup class='bibleverse'>4</sup> Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister; and call understanding thy kinswoman: <sup class='bibleverse'>5</sup> That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the stranger which flattereth with her words. 

<sup class='bibleverse'>6</sup> For at the window of my house I looked through my casement, <sup class='bibleverse'>7</sup> And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding,^[**7:7** the youths: Heb. the sons] <sup class='bibleverse'>8</sup> Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house, <sup class='bibleverse'>9</sup> In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night:^[**7:9** in the evening: Heb. in the evening of days] <sup class='bibleverse'>10</sup> And, behold, there met him a woman with the attire of an harlot, and subtil of heart. <sup class='bibleverse'>11</sup> (She is loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house: <sup class='bibleverse'>12</sup> Now is she without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at every corner.) <sup class='bibleverse'>13</sup> So she caught him, and kissed him, and with an impudent face said unto him,^[**7:13** with…: Heb. she strengthened her face and said] <sup class='bibleverse'>14</sup> I have peace offerings with me; this day have I payed my vows.^[**7:14** I have…: Heb.

<sup class='bibleverse'>1</sup> Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice? <sup class='bibleverse'>2</sup> She standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the places of the paths. <sup class='bibleverse'>3</sup> She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the doors. <sup class='bibleverse'>4</sup> Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice is to the sons of man. <sup class='bibleverse'>5</sup> O ye simple, understand wisdom: and, ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart. <sup class='bibleverse'>6</sup> Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of my lips shall be right things. <sup class='bibleverse'>7</sup> For my mouth shall speak truth; and wickedness is an abomination to my lips.^[**8:7** an…: Heb. the abomination of my lips] <sup class='bibleverse'>8</sup> All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; there is nothing froward or perverse in them.^[**8:8** froward: Heb. wreathed] <sup class='bibleverse'>9</sup> They are all plain to him that understandeth, and right to them that find knowledge. <sup class='bibleverse'>10</sup> Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice gold. <sup class='bibleverse'>11</sup> For wisdom is better than rubies; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it. 



<sup class='bibleverse'>12</sup> I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty inventions.^[**8:12** prudence: or, subtilty] <sup class='bibleverse'>13</sup> The fear of the LORD is to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate. <sup class='bibleverse'>14</sup> Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom: I am understanding; I have strength. <sup class='bibleverse'>15</sup> By me kings reign, and princes decree justice. <sup class='bibleverse'>16</sup> By me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth. <sup class='bibleverse'>17</sup> I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me. <sup class='bibleverse'>18</sup> Riches and honour are with me; yea, durable riches and righteousness. <sup class='bibleverse'>19</sup> My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my revenue than choice silver. <sup class='bibleverse'>20</sup> I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment:^[**8:20** lead: or, walk] <sup class='bibleverse'>21</sup> That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasures.
