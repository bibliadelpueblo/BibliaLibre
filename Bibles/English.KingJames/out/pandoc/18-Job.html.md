<sup>1</sup> There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil. <sup>2</sup> And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters. <sup>3</sup> His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.^*^+ 1.3 household: or, husbandry+ 1.3 men: Heb. sons 
^[1.3 substance: or, cattle]

<sup>4</sup> And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them. <sup>5</sup> And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.^*^ 
^[1.5 continually: Heb. all the days]

<sup>6</sup> Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.^*^+ 1.6 among: Heb. in the midst of <sup>7</sup> And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it. <sup>8</sup> And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?+ 1.8 considered: Heb. set thy heart on <sup>9</sup> Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought? <sup>10</sup> Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.+ 1.10 substance: or, cattle <sup>11</sup> But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face.+ 1.11 and he…: Heb. if he curse thee not to thy face <sup>12</sup> And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD.+ 1.12 power: Heb. hand 
^[1.6 Satan: Heb. the adversary]

<sup>13</sup> And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house: <sup>14</sup> And there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them: <sup>15</sup> And the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee. <sup>16</sup> While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.^*^ <sup>17</sup> While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.+ 1.17 fell: Heb. rushed <sup>18</sup> While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house: <sup>19</sup> And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.+ 1.19 from…: Heb. from aside, etc 
^[1.16 The fire…: or, A great fire]

<sup>20</sup> Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped,^*^ <sup>21</sup> And said, Naked came I out of my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD. <sup>22</sup> In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.+ 1.22 charged…: or, attributed folly to God
^[1.20 mantle: or, robe] 

# 2 
<sup>1</sup> Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the LORD. <sup>2</sup> And the LORD said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it. <sup>3</sup> And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause.^*^ <sup>4</sup> And Satan answered the LORD, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life. <sup>5</sup> But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face. <sup>6</sup> And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thine hand; but save his life.+ 2.6 but: or, only 
^[2.3 to destroy…: Heb. to swallow him up]

<sup>7</sup> So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown. <sup>8</sup> And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he sat down among the ashes. 

<sup>9</sup> Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine integrity? curse God, and die. <sup>10</sup> But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips. 

<sup>11</sup> Now when Job’s three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him. <sup>12</sup> And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven. <sup>13</sup> So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that his grief was very great. 

# 3 
<sup>1</sup> After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day. <sup>2</sup> And Job spake, and said,^*^ <sup>3</sup> Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was said, There is a man child conceived. <sup>4</sup> Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it. <sup>5</sup> Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.+ 3.5 stain: or, challenge+ 3.5 let the…: or, let them terrify it, as those who have a bitter day <sup>6</sup> As for that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months.+ 3.6 let it not be…: or, let it not rejoice among the days <sup>7</sup> Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein. <sup>8</sup> Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning.+ 3.8 their…: or, leviathan <sup>9</sup> Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but have none; neither let it see the dawning of the day:+ 3.9 the dawning…: Heb. the eyelids of the morning <sup>10</sup> Because it shut not up the doors of my mother’s womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes. 
^[3.2 spake: Heb. answered]

<sup>11</sup> Why died I not from the womb? why did I not give up the ghost when I came out of the belly? <sup>12</sup> Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck? <sup>13</sup> For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest, <sup>14</sup> With kings and counsellors of the earth, which built desolate places for themselves; <sup>15</sup> Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver: <sup>16</sup> Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants which never saw light. <sup>17</sup> There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at rest.^*^ <sup>18</sup> There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor. <sup>19</sup> The small and great are there; and the servant is free from his master. 
^[3.17 weary: Heb. wearied in strength]

<sup>20</sup> Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter in soul; <sup>21</sup> Which long for death, but it cometh not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures;^*^ <sup>22</sup> Which rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find the grave? <sup>23</sup> Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in? <sup>24</sup> For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters.+ 3.24 I eat: Heb. my meat <sup>25</sup> For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me.+ 3.25 the thing…: Heb. I feared a fear, and it came upon me <sup>26</sup> I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.
^[3.21 long: Heb. wait]

<sup>1</sup> Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said, <sup>2</sup> If we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can withhold himself from speaking?^*^+ 4.2 withhold…: Heb. refrain from words? <sup>3</sup> Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands. <sup>4</sup> Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees. <sup>5</sup> But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled. <sup>6</sup> Is not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the uprightness of thy ways? 
^[4.2 to…: Heb. a word]

<sup>7</sup> Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off? <sup>8</sup> Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same. <sup>9</sup> By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed.^*^ <sup>10</sup> The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken. <sup>11</sup> The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion’s whelps are scattered abroad. 
^[4.9 by the breath…: that is, by his anger]

<sup>12</sup> Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a little thereof.^*^ <sup>13</sup> In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men, <sup>14</sup> Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake.+ 4.14 came…: Heb. met+ 4.14 all: Heb. the multitude of <sup>15</sup> Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up: <sup>16</sup> It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image was before mine eyes, there was silence, and I heard a voice, saying,+ 4.16 there…: or, I heard a still voice <sup>17</sup> Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker? <sup>18</sup> Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly:+ 4.18 and his…: or, nor in his angels, in whom he put light <sup>19</sup> How much less in them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, which are crushed before the moth? <sup>20</sup> They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for ever without any regarding it.+ 4.20 destroyed: Heb. beaten in pieces <sup>21</sup> Doth not their excellency which is in them go away? they die, even without wisdom.

<sup>1</sup> Call now, if there be any that will answer thee; and to which of the saints wilt thou turn?^*^ <sup>2</sup> For wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly one.+ 5.2 envy: or, indignation <sup>3</sup> I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his habitation. <sup>4</sup> His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the gate, neither is there any to deliver them. <sup>5</sup> Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of the thorns, and the robber swalloweth up their substance. 
^[5.1 turn: or, look?]

<sup>14</sup> How much less shall I answer him, and choose out my words to reason with him? <sup>15</sup> Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer, but I would make supplication to my judge. <sup>16</sup> If I had called, and he had answered me; yet would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice. <sup>17</sup> For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds without cause. <sup>18</sup> He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with bitterness. <sup>19</sup> If I speak of strength, lo, he is strong: and if of judgment, who shall set me a time to plead? <sup>20</sup> If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me: if I say, I am perfect, it shall also prove me perverse. <sup>21</sup> Though I were perfect, yet would I not know my soul: I would despise my life. 

<sup>22</sup> This is one thing, therefore I said it, He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked. <sup>23</sup> If the scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the innocent. <sup>24</sup> The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the faces of the judges thereof; if not, where, and who is he?

<sup>1</sup> But Job answered and said, <sup>2</sup> Hear diligently my speech, and let this be your consolations. <sup>3</sup> Suffer me that I may speak; and after that I have spoken, mock on. <sup>4</sup> As for me, is my complaint to man? and if it were so, why should not my spirit be troubled?^*^ <sup>5</sup> Mark me, and be astonished, and lay your hand upon your mouth.+ 21.5 Mark…: Heb.

<sup>7</sup> Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in power? <sup>8</sup> Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their offspring before their eyes. <sup>9</sup> Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of God upon them.^*^ <sup>10</sup> Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf. <sup>11</sup> They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children dance. <sup>12</sup> They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the organ. <sup>13</sup> They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave.+ 21.13 in wealth: or, in mirth <sup>14</sup> Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways. <sup>15</sup> What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what profit should we have, if we pray unto him? <sup>16</sup> Lo, their good is not in their hand: the counsel of the wicked is far from me. 
^[21.9 safe…: Heb. peace from]

<sup>17</sup> How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! and how oft cometh their destruction upon them! God distributeth sorrows in his anger.^*^ <sup>18</sup> They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm carrieth away.+ 21.18 carrieth: Heb. stealeth <sup>19</sup> God layeth up his iniquity for his children: he rewardeth him, and he shall know it.+ 21.19 his iniquity: that is, the punishment of his iniquity <sup>20</sup> His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty. <sup>21</sup> For what pleasure hath he in his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off in the midst? <sup>22</sup> Shall any teach God knowledge? seeing he judgeth those that are high. <sup>23</sup> One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet.+ 21.23 his…: Heb. his very, or, the strength of, his perfection <sup>24</sup> His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with marrow.+ 21.24 breasts: or, milk pails <sup>25</sup> And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never eateth with pleasure. <sup>26</sup> They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall cover them.

No; but he would put strength in me. <sup>7</sup> There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be delivered for ever from my judge. 
^[23.2 stroke: Heb. hand]

<sup>8</sup> Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I cannot perceive him: <sup>9</sup> On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold him: he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him: <sup>10</sup> But he knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.^*^ <sup>11</sup> My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined. <sup>12</sup> Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food.+ 23.12 esteemed: Heb. hid, or, laid up+ 23.12 my…: or, my appointed portion 
^[23.10 that…: Heb. that is with me]

<sup>13</sup> But he is in one mind, and who can turn him? and what his soul desireth, even that he doeth. <sup>14</sup> For he performeth the thing that is appointed for me: and many such things are with him. <sup>15</sup> Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am afraid of him. <sup>16</sup> For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me: <sup>17</sup> Because I was not cut off before the darkness, neither hath he covered the darkness from my face.

<sup>1</sup> Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, do they that know him not see his days? <sup>2</sup> Some remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks, and feed thereof.^*^ <sup>3</sup> They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the widow’s ox for a pledge. <sup>4</sup> They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide themselves together. <sup>5</sup> Behold, as wild asses in the desert, go they forth to their work; rising betimes for a prey: the wilderness yieldeth food for them and for their children. <sup>6</sup> They reap every one his corn in the field: and they gather the vintage of the wicked.+ 24.6 corn: Heb. mingled corn, or, dredge+ 24.6 they gather…: Heb. the wicked gather the vintage <sup>7</sup> They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, that they have no covering in the cold. <sup>8</sup> They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the rock for want of a shelter. <sup>9</sup> They pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge of the poor. <sup>10</sup> They cause him to go naked without clothing, and they take away the sheaf from the hungry; <sup>11</sup> Which make oil within their walls, and tread their winepresses, and suffer thirst. <sup>12</sup> Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded crieth out: yet God layeth not folly to them. 
^[24.2 feed…: or, feed them]

<sup>13</sup> They are of those that rebel against the light; they know not the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof. <sup>14</sup> The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy, and in the night is as a thief. <sup>15</sup> The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me: and disguiseth his face.^*^ <sup>16</sup> In the dark they dig through houses, which they had marked for themselves in the daytime: they know not the light. <sup>17</sup> For the morning is to them even as the shadow of death: if one know them, they are in the terrors of the shadow of death. 
^[24.15 disguiseth…: Heb. setteth his face in secret]

<sup>18</sup> He is swift as the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth: he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards. <sup>19</sup> Drought and heat consume the snow waters: so doth the grave those which have sinned.^*^ <sup>20</sup> The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him; he shall be no more remembered; and wickedness shall be broken as a tree. <sup>21</sup> He evil entreateth the barren that beareth not: and doeth not good to the widow. <sup>22</sup> He draweth also the mighty with his power: he riseth up, and no man is sure of life.+ 24.22 no…: or, he trusteth not his own life <sup>23</sup> Though it be given him to be in safety, whereon he resteth; yet his eyes are upon their ways. <sup>24</sup> They are exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought low; they are taken out of the way as all other, and cut off as the tops of the ears of corn.+ 24.24 are gone: Heb. are not+ 24.24 taken…: Heb. closed up <sup>25</sup> And if it be not so now, who will make me a liar, and make my speech nothing worth?

<sup>1</sup> Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, <sup>2</sup> Dominion and fear are with him, he maketh peace in his high places. <sup>3</sup> Is there any number of his armies? and upon whom doth not his light arise? <sup>4</sup> How then can man be justified with God? or how can he be clean that is born of a woman? <sup>5</sup> Behold even to the moon, and it shineth not; yea, the stars are not pure in his sight. <sup>6</sup> How much less man, that is a worm? and the son of man, which is a worm? 

# 26 
<sup>1</sup> But Job answered and said, <sup>2</sup> How hast thou helped him that is without power? how savest thou the arm that hath no strength? <sup>3</sup> How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom? and how hast thou plentifully declared the thing as it is? <sup>4</sup> To whom hast thou uttered words? and whose spirit came from thee? 

<sup>5</sup> Dead things are formed from under the waters, and the inhabitants thereof.^*^ <sup>6</sup> Hell is naked before him, and destruction hath no covering. <sup>7</sup> He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, and hangeth the earth upon nothing. <sup>8</sup> He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is not rent under them. <sup>9</sup> He holdeth back the face of his throne, and spreadeth his cloud upon it. <sup>10</sup> He hath compassed the waters with bounds, until the day and night come to an end.+ 26.10 until…: Heb. until the end of light with darkness <sup>11</sup> The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof. <sup>12</sup> He divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding he smiteth through the proud.+ 26.12 the proud: Heb. pride <sup>13</sup> By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath formed the crooked serpent. <sup>14</sup> Lo, these are parts of his ways: but how little a portion is heard of him? but the thunder of his power who can understand?

^[27.1 continued: Heb. added to take up]

<sup>7</sup> Let mine enemy be as the wicked, and he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous. <sup>8</sup> For what is the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained, when God taketh away his soul? <sup>9</sup> Will God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him? <sup>10</sup> Will he delight himself in the Almighty? will he always call upon God? 

<sup>11</sup> I will teach you by the hand of God: that which is with the Almighty will I not conceal.^*^ <sup>12</sup> Behold, all ye yourselves have seen it; why then are ye thus altogether vain? <sup>13</sup> This is the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage of oppressors, which they shall receive of the Almighty. <sup>14</sup> If his children be multiplied, it is for the sword: and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread. <sup>15</sup> Those that remain of him shall be buried in death: and his widows shall not weep. <sup>16</sup> Though he heap up silver as the dust, and prepare raiment as the clay; <sup>17</sup> He may prepare it, but the just shall put it on, and the innocent shall divide the silver. <sup>18</sup> He buildeth his house as a moth, and as a booth that the keeper maketh. <sup>19</sup> The rich man shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered: he openeth his eyes, and he is not. <sup>20</sup> Terrors take hold on him as waters, a tempest stealeth him away in the night. <sup>21</sup> The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth: and as a storm hurleth him out of his place. <sup>22</sup> For God shall cast upon him, and not spare: he would fain flee out of his hand.+ 27.22 he…: Heb. in fleeing he would flee <sup>23</sup> Men shall clap their hands at him, and shall hiss him out of his place.

<sup>1</sup> So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.^*^ <sup>2</sup> Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.+ 32.2 himself: Heb. his soul <sup>3</sup> Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job. <sup>4</sup> Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were elder than he.+ 32.4 waited…: Heb. expected Job in words+ 32.4 elder: Heb. elder for days <sup>5</sup> When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, then his wrath was kindled.

<sup>10</sup> Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding: far be it from God, that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.^*^ <sup>11</sup> For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every man to find according to his ways. <sup>12</sup> Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment. <sup>13</sup> Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the whole world?+ 34.13 the whole: Heb. all of it? <sup>14</sup> If he set his heart upon man, if he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath;+ 34.14 man: Heb. him <sup>15</sup> All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto dust.

^[34.17 govern: Heb. bind?]

<sup>31</sup> Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne chastisement, I will not offend any more: <sup>32</sup> That which I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more. <sup>33</sup> Should it be according to thy mind? he will recompense it, whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I: therefore speak what thou knowest.^*^ <sup>34</sup> Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken unto me.+ 34.34 of…: Heb. of heart <sup>35</sup> Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words were without wisdom. <sup>36</sup> My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end because of his answers for wicked men.+ 34.36 My…: or, My father, let Job be tried <sup>37</sup> For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth his hands among us, and multiplieth his words against God.
^[34.33 according…: Heb. from with thee?] 

# 35 
<sup>1</sup> Elihu spake moreover, and said, <sup>2</sup> Thinkest thou this to be right, that thou saidst, My righteousness is more than God’s? <sup>3</sup> For thou saidst, What advantage will it be unto thee? and, What profit shall I have, if I be cleansed from my sin?^*^ <sup>4</sup> I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee.+ 35.4 answer…: Heb. return to thee words <sup>5</sup> Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds which are higher than thou. <sup>6</sup> If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? or if thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him? <sup>7</sup> If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of thine hand? <sup>8</sup> Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art; and thy righteousness may profit the son of man. 
^[35.3 if…: or, by it more than by my sin]

<sup>9</sup> By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed to cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty. <sup>10</sup> But none saith, Where is God my maker, who giveth songs in the night; <sup>11</sup> Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven? <sup>12</sup> There they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride of evil men. <sup>13</sup> Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it. 

<sup>14</sup> Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, yet judgment is before him; therefore trust thou in him. <sup>15</sup> But now, because it is not so, he hath visited in his anger; yet he knoweth it not in great extremity:^*^+ 35.15 he knoweth: that is, Job knoweth <sup>16</sup> Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain; he multiplieth words without knowledge.
^[35.15 he hath: that is, God hath]

<sup>1</sup> Elihu also proceeded, and said, <sup>2</sup> Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee that I have yet to speak on God’s behalf.^*^ <sup>3</sup> I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker. <sup>4</sup> For truly my words shall not be false: he that is perfect in knowledge is with thee.

<sup>15</sup> He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their ears in oppression.^*^ <sup>16</sup> Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a broad place, where there is no straitness; and that which should be set on thy table should be full of fatness.+ 36.16 that…: Heb. the rest of thy table <sup>17</sup> But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and justice take hold on thee.+ 36.17 take…: or, should uphold thee <sup>18</sup> Because there is wrath, beware lest he take thee away with his stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee.+ 36.18 deliver…: Heb. turn thee aside <sup>19</sup> Will he esteem thy riches? no, not gold, nor all the forces of strength. <sup>20</sup> Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place. <sup>21</sup> Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction. <sup>22</sup> Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him? <sup>23</sup> Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity? 
^[36.15 poor: or, afflicted]

<sup>24</sup> Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold. <sup>25</sup> Every man may see it; man may behold it afar off. <sup>26</sup> Behold, God is great, and we know him not, neither can the number of his years be searched out. <sup>27</sup> For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof: <sup>28</sup> Which the clouds do drop and distil upon man abundantly. <sup>29</sup> Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, or the noise of his tabernacle? <sup>30</sup> Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the bottom of the sea.^*^ <sup>31</sup> For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in abundance. <sup>32</sup> With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it not to shine by the cloud that cometh betwixt. <sup>33</sup> The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the cattle also concerning the vapour.+ 36.33 the vapour: Heb. that which goeth up

<sup>1</sup> Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said, <sup>2</sup> Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct him? he that reproveth God, let him answer it. 

<sup>3</sup> Then Job answered the LORD, and said, <sup>4</sup> Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay mine hand upon my mouth. <sup>5</sup> Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yea, twice; but I will proceed no further. 

<sup>6</sup> Then answered the LORD unto Job out of the whirlwind, and said, <sup>7</sup> Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me. <sup>8</sup> Wilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous? <sup>9</sup> Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice like him? <sup>10</sup> Deck thyself now with majesty and excellency; and array thyself with glory and beauty. <sup>11</sup> Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and behold every one that is proud, and abase him. <sup>12</sup> Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low; and tread down the wicked in their place. <sup>13</sup> Hide them in the dust together; and bind their faces in secret. <sup>14</sup> Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can save thee.

Sharp pieces of potsherd <sup>31</sup> He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment. <sup>32</sup> He maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the deep to be hoary. <sup>33</sup> Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.+ 41.33 is made without fear: or, behave themselves without fear <sup>34</sup> He beholdeth all high things: he is a king over all the children of pride.

<sup>7</sup> And it was so, that after the LORD had spoken these words unto Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends: for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath. <sup>8</sup> Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will I accept: lest I deal with you after your folly, in that ye have not spoken of me the thing which is right, like my servant Job.^*^ <sup>9</sup> So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went, and did according as the LORD commanded them: the LORD also accepted Job.+ 42.9 Job: Heb. the face of Job

<sup>10</sup> And the LORD turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before.+ 42.10 gave…: Heb. added all that had been to Job unto the double <sup>11</sup> Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him over all the evil that the LORD had brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of money, and every one an earring of gold. <sup>12</sup> So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses. <sup>13</sup> He had also seven sons and three daughters. <sup>14</sup> And he called the name of the first, Jemima; and the name of the second, Kezia; and the name of the third, Keren-happuch. <sup>15</sup> And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren. <sup>16</sup> After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons’ sons, even four generations. <sup>17</sup> So Job died, being old and full of days.
