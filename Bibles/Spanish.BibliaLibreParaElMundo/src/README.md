This folder contains the source files from which bibmark generates the main markdown files for the bible. It contains a "bibleedit" folder that contains the USFM sources in BibleEdit format. Bibmark detects this folder and will generate USFM files in the "src" folder accordingly. This "src" folder also contains a xml file booknames.xml with the names of the bible books in different languages. Next it contains a linklist.xml file containing parallel verses for the Luther1912 Bible. This file is mapped to the spablm verse schema using the parallelversesmap.md file, so the parallel verses can be used in the Biblia Libre Para El Mundo bible. Then, the "src" subdirectory contains two framework files, one framework.paragraphs.md that is taken form the framework.md output of the World English Bible, to import paragraphs. And then, it contains framework.titles.md that is taken from the framework.md of the ReinaValera1909 and contains titles.
